3.0,4/27/2019,"The first time I came here the manager helped us get a table at the bar when it was really crowded and the food was great. The second time we actually made a reservation and the service was terrible. Margaritas and the guacamole were amazing, but we sat for over an hour without being seen, asked for the check 3 times, and had to actually ask the manager to ring us out. Maybe it was an off day for them, but it was unfortunate. They were nice about it once it was brought to their attention. I would return as the drinks are good, atmosphere is nice, and the prices aren't bad for the neighborhood. However, beware that the service might not be 100% when it's crowded.",0,0,0,Michelle M.,"Endicott, NY",224,3,0

I was here for a birthday dinner with my wife & she felt the same way..  we were extremely disappointed with the lack of variety.. and lack of Mexican favorites.. whoever was responsible for this menu selection needs to have a reassessment.

2.0,3/18/2019,"Let me preface by saying that this used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, despite it being a 'chain'. The service was always stellar and the food was good. I haven't visited for a few years, but wow, things have changed, at least on the service side. I arrived around 6:30 this past Saturday. Yes. A busy time, but I chose to sit at the bar, as the lounge area was nowhere near capacity. First I waited about 10 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink. No formal welcome, I might add. While waiting, the bartenders, and who I assume to be a manager (full suit) were casually chatting amongst themselves and only paying attention to the service bar, or so it seemed. Another 10 minutes passed until I was asked for a food order. The food was served very quickly, and (good news) was pretty good. After finishing, I waited another 10 or so for the check. I finally had to ask for it. At this point, the bartender scoffed and moved the check from behind a bar decoration. I could not see it and was not told it was there. Additionally, I was never offered a refill on my soft drink after being served one at the beginning of this very disappointing experience!",0,0,0,Todd B.,"Chicago, IL",53,3,0

1.0,3/8/2019,"I had such a horrible time here. The service was terrible and the food was okay but not great, especially for their prices. From the moment I entered the restaurant with my boyfriend, we were rudely greeted. We were told that the wait for a table would be around two hours and that we should suggest eating at the bar. I had a feeling it was mostly because we didn't look like their usual customers. We kindly thanked the woman at the front and decided to go elsewhere. Suddenly a table became available and she walked us to it. When it came to the server, he wasn't terrible but he definitely seemed preoccupied. He was rushing us and seemed as though he didn't want to be there. The food wasn't hot and honestly I've had better Mexican food elsewhere. The whole experience was shocking and unbelievable for a place I've heard so many good things about. I will not recommend this place to anyone. There are so many other Mexican restaurants out there, less expensive that have amazing service and amazing food, especially in that area.",0,0,0,Shantel L.,"New York, NY",2,9,13
4.0,3/4/2019,"This is a much larger restaurant than their Tribeca location. This location kind of has a Cheesecake Factory vibe, which I was not expecting. I came in on a Friday night with 2 girlfriends and tried to get seated for dinner. We were told it would be over an hour wait, but were advised we could go to the bar and that was first come, first served. Surprisingly, as soon as we walked over, there was a couple leaving from the bar, so we snagged those seats. Others who were in the bar area weren't quick enough to get the open seats, so they were giving us glares all night. Oops. We started with house margaritas which are always spot on. I love their complimentary chips and salsa, it has a good flavor to it. We also got an appetizer with shredded chicken and beans that was kind of stacked between round tortilla chips. I don't remember the name of it, but it's amazing. It fed the 3 of us and then some, and we all enjoyed it. I have also gotten the chicken taquito on a past occasion, but it's rather small for the price you pay. The service can be kind of slow, and it can be tough trying to flag down a bartender for another drink. Overall, I would return if I was in the area.",0,0,0,J K.,"New York, NY",4,164,95
5.0,2/28/2019,"Two words! Tableside guacamole! Ok, well meybe more will follow that but this is actually the highlight of the night! When me and my friends are in the mood for good guacamole, this is where we always end up! I don't care what else we order, guacolme and margaritas always come first! Every time I eat here I leave so stuffed that I feel like I ahould bring a wheelchair and be wheeled home, thats how amazing the food is.The service has always been great and they have the nicest manager come to our table all of the time. They get a big pluse here for ginuine hospitality. The only downside to this place was when it was closed on my birthday in december ane I had to settle for early beacuse of a private party. Beacuse it was my birthday i actually walked in and joked with them that they remembered my birthday. But I was sad to see that they wouldn't budge on the private party ordeal. Oh well. You can't win them all. The place was reserved months in advance so I'll give them credit for that. There were no hard feelings about it and I did come back the next day beacuse they let me make a reservation! It's still a great place to eat. Ive been eating at this place for about 10 years and brag about it/ highly recomend it to all of my friends when they visit nyc! A++ guys.

5.0,2/26/2019,They don't charge you for chips and salsa. That's a big deal. Every nice Mexican spot out here charges for that and it's annoying!

3.0,2/25/2019,"Well, I can cross this one off of my list. I have always wanted to try Rosa Mexicano, specifically because I used to walk by all of the time. I decided to treat my girlfriend here and finally had a chance to go to Rosa Mexicano! Let's begin with the amazing parts of Rosa M. We were immediately seated, a manager stopped by to ask us how our meal went, all of our food came out accurate and at the right temperature and the place is beautiful to look at. We ordered flautas, best part of the meal to us both, it was so flavorful, the grilled shrimp with rice, decent, and the steak with an enchilada, also decent. For dessert we had the Mexican chocolate cake, delicious and the churros which were okay. We ordered two cocojitos which were mixed well and tasty. Nothing was really special but all came out accurate so not much complaint. Now, seeing that we didn't arrive until 10:30 and the kitchen closed at 11:30, it's fair to say that we had to rush the experience but I mean it really registered when our waiter brought out the bill out of thin air and said, ""mama needs the check"". Wasn't expecting the check until after we finished our meal but I guess they at least let us put in our full order. Also, my girlfriend and I also noticed how unhappy the employees looked. It was terrible. I ordered the guacamole because I saw that its prepared before the table but to my surprise the employee looked over it. It kind of ruined the purpose. If I'm going to pay for a guacamole show, smile or look entertained for the customers. Its $16 for a 1 avacado guacamole and the show was dull. Almost a complete waste of money but it tasted okay. It was nice to finally see what this was all about but in short it just reminds me of a more expensive cheesecake factory. Basic foods, described to be outstanding but are basic, drinks, which we only had one each so I can't speak much on but can say it was tasty, desserts which were good and a beautiful setting but still nothing to separate the flavor from anything you'd find at any hole in the wall. We aren't disappointed or excited about this place. It's a very solid neutral and so we won't be back but it was nice to finally visit.",0,0,0,Cassandra H.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,124,80
2.0,2/23/2019,"With all other Mexican options in Manhattan, don't waste your money here!!!

4.0,2/8/2019,"I love to finish my meals with something sweet so here's a look at not one but three of the dessert options on the Rosa Mexicano menu for Restaurant Week Winter 2019 - Tres Leche, Churros and Pastel de Chocolate Mexicano. The tres leche was precisely sweetened and not over soaked, something really difficult to achieve. The churros were warm and crispy with just the right amount of cinnamon. Last but not least, the chocolate cake was rich and decadent. Thankfully, the spice didn't overpower the chocolate which I've found common at Mexican eateries.",0,0,0,Andrew K.,"New York, NY",368,77,57

1.0,2/4/2019,"The the decor of the location is nice, it's large, and there is ample space to go with a group. The menu is ok, though a bit pricey for dinner time. The quality/taste seems a bit mediocre, so I'm not going to miss this place, as I will never come back here again, or any other Rosa Mexicano. My things were stolen, I felt violated, and management took absolutely no responsibility for what goes on. My review is a bit late, but I was here last May. We were a group of friends sitting at a round table for dinner, and I had an empty seat next to me. I put a small gym bag in the empty chair. We left right around closing time. We all agreed to tipping a standard amount. We took a train, en route to downtown, one stop down, I realized I left my bag on the chair. We went back within 10 minutes. The restaurant has closed, but the staff was in there cleaning up and let us in. I asked to look for my bag; it wasn't at the table where I was sitting. Then, someone said, ""oh this bag, it is in the staff closet."" They brought it out and I said, ""yes! that's my bag!"" I look inside--everything is rummaged through. EVERYTHING was out of order. From a coin purse being emptied into the bag, to a sneaker, to an envelope with a magnet in it. Someone tried on a white sneaker of mine--this sneaker was found under a table in the front potion of the restaurant. They threw the socks on the floor, under the table in the front--right across the staff closet. It seems to me that someone found my bag, went through it at an entirely other table, shoved some things back, forgotten some things under the table, and put it in the staff closet. Some things were missing, some things were there. All I can say is that this person who stole from my bag was certainly female--but, honestly, what kind of person steals a mini hair straightener, but leaves a Mac charger? I guess, thanks. You spared me from spending $80 to replace it. I lost things as silly as a magnet I got from a trip to Nashville, to a set of gift cards, worth at around $300 total. Anyways, I ask the staff to see the tapes. The staff said that the cameras don't work. I got the contact information for the manager who would have access. He confirmed, that the cameras are not currently operating.On a phone call, he said to me, ""look I'm sure you were at the bar drinking, it was busy day for us, and these types of things happen at the bar, where there are a lot of people."" I said, ""sir, actually, I wasn't at the bar, was at a table with a handful of friends for dinner, we were not drinking. And, trust me, if I was at the bar, or a loud club, or at a McDonald's, I would not be reaching out to you. Trust me, I would have taken full of responsibility of whatever happened to me."" He got my point, and said he'd get back to me. He said I could come in and order some food, on-the-house, or get a reimbursement of the items I owned (providing I have receipts/proof). I opted for the latter, a couple days later, someone calls me asking about the incident, to get the details. And, they never called me again. The end.",4,1,0,Roxy A.,"Orlando, FL",20,43,28

4.0,1/17/2019,"I'll be honest, when we moved to NYC from Chicago I thought to myself, ""good-bye Mexican food, see you every six months when I visit.  It turns out, I won't have the best, but I will have pretty darn close here!  Rosa does a great job with vegetarian options and I love their unique take on ""nachos"".  Their Nachos de Tres Quesos is a stack full of deliciousness, but eat it immediately because once it gets soggy it's not quite as fanciful.  The Queso Fundido is another good appetizer.  I order a side of black beans and make it into a meal.  One thing I have noticed is that lately they have been skimping on the poblano rajas - not nice, so be sure to speak up if yours is missing it too.  We always order the Enchiladas Mestiza for entree, though the Tres Enchiladas is a great option to try all three sauces!  The best way to end the meal is with the Churros.  They aren't as authentic as the $1 ones you get on the subway, but they do a pretty good job for a restaurant.Things to note:-DO NOT GO TO THE LINCOLN CENTER LOCATION: We live a block from that one and will take the train down just to go to this specific location.  Not all Rosa's have been created equal unfortunately.-If and when they mess up your order, which does happen, the staff and manager have always been quick to correct it and have always offered us something to make it up. That's how you keep your customers coming back - quality customer service.  Thank you Rosa Union Square for treating your patrons with respect and care.-If you're in a wheelchair or have a stroller, they do not have an ADA accessible ramp.  Not that I have seen at least, but they have always assisted in helping us in.",1,0,1,Sonali K.,"New York, NY",60,138,14
4.0,1/15/2019,"It's all about the Frozen, Pomegranate Margaritas and Table Side Guacamole. Let's be the friends who can be honest, even when the truth hurts. New York is not a Mecca for good Mexican food. What it can do is throw a party and that's what Rosa is to me. A party in my mouth. High ceilings, loud music, dim lights. It's more discoteca than a serious restaurant. That's not entirely fair. It is a good restaurant and maybe even a great one given the alternatives in this city for fun, good, Mexican cuisine. Southern Californians, Texans, New Mexicans will probably turn their noses up as this is not what you're used to. That's ok. Give it a try. Being a native Texan, Super Fan of TexMex and currently living in Southern California, you may ask yourself, ""Self, why does Mark come here?""Two reasons:Frozen, Pomegranate Margaritas $13.50Table Side Guacamole $16.00With this diet, you can't go wrong. Rosa has this down. I make a point each time I'm here to hit up the Union Sq/Flatiron or Lincoln Center locations for these two (maybe more than 1 Margarita) items. They are that good. Don't want the sweet? Frozen like margs are available too. Don't need to feel the burn? The guacamole is custom made so you control the heat. Perfect!What about the rest of the food? There are a few dishes I like. Tacos al Carbon Arrachera $27 is delicious Enchiladas Mestiza $23 are goodAlambre a la Mexicana $29 is a great mix of flavorsTampiqueña de Carne Asada $29 is greatSo there're other reasons to come beyond the marg and guac. The vibe is young and fun, casual and a perfect Happy Hour meet up on a Mantic Monday. Couples and singles welcome at the bar. Each location has a similar theme but can feel much different. This location in Union Sq is my favorite followed by Lincoln Center with Tribeca my least favorite. I've never been to the original on 1st.So, should you come? Absolutely Will you love it?

Maybe i'm delusional but I think there was a time when this was considered fancy Mexican food.  No longer.  I had mole enchiladas (which I order at pretty much every Mexican restaurant i go to) and it was terrible. The chicken was dry and cheap tasting with basically just a ton of sauce thrown over for flavor to try to hide how bad the chicken was. Very overpriced.  Drinks are overpriced too. If you're going to charge $14 for a traditional margarita, make it a little bigger and better quality than a margarita I could get near my apartment for half the price.  The guacamole was good so i'll give it 2 stars for that.",0,0,0,John D.,"Brooklyn, NY",112,39,2

I'm sure the drinks are good so maybe this place has at least one redeeming quality, but it's just absurd that most entrees will run you like $20-$25 here and to be completely honest I'd put the quality on par with like, I don't know, Taco Bell? I've had really really good cheap Mexican before so I know it's certainly possible to do well inexpensively. I've ordered a number of things from the menu. The quesadillas are fine, as are most things with three ingredients that are high in fat and hard for a chef to f*** up. But even the quesadillas are meh. I've made better at 3 am after a night of heavy drinking. I had the pollo adobado last time ($23.50) and it was straight up dry chicken on melted cheese with some soggy peppers. Enchiladas are yuck.The one thing that's absolutely GREAT is the guacamole. I mean, it's seriously dank guac. Some of the best I've ever had. But it's $16 for maybe 2 avocadoes worth of guac. And, not to toot my own horn, but I make a pretty good guac myself (as it requires no finesse or skill) and can do so for a fraction of the price.

Rosa Mexicano started celebrating on Tuesday with a special three-course menu and a special tequila & mezcal tasting session with dessert pairings. On top of all this there was live music and dance performances. (Including a very famous samba dancer??)

4.0,12/13/2018,"As a southern California native, I was wary of my first NY Mexican food experience, but I was happily surprised. I arrived at Rosa Mexicano with a group of about 10 to celebrate a friend's birthday. Off the bat, you can tell this is a perfect place for large groups. The space is huge (especially relative to some other food joints in the area) and it very cute and well decorated. The perfect mood for a celebration or even an intimate date, because you have your own space. Food: -Our table started off with two guacamoles to share, YUM! The serving size is pretty generous, so I recommend starting off with one order for the table. Also be sure to tell the man making the mix if you are sensitive to spice, so he can adjust accordingly. -The chips were light and delicious, and they were great about refills. I could have eaten my body weight in chips if no one stopped me...-Because I was a recovering from a cold, I ordered the tortilla soup for dinner. The bowl came out to me empty, just with tortilla strips. A server followed and poured a cup of soup into my bowl. ~fancy~ Unfortunately, my soup was not very hot, which is why I left my review at 4 stars. I assume this had to do with being in a large group and them bringing out food out all at once. Service: The service was outstanding. As I mentioned above, our table ordered two guac's to share. After digging in, some of our friends noted that the guac was too spicy for them. We didn't decide to tell the staff, but just briefly mentioned it at our table. My chance, our waiter overheard us and got a new bowl of guacamole over to us right away. Very very sweet of him. In addition, he did not charge us for all of the guacamole that our table had. And on top of that, he brought the sauces on the side from my friend's entree, as he had noted that she was the one that thought the guac was spicy, and that the entree sauce might be spicy for her as well. I had never seen such initiative from a server. He was very thoughtful and sweet to go out of his way and do that!

I only wish I had taken some pictures to show how amazing everything was.I can't say enough about the service and staff.  They were friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in the door.  The restaurant was very busy, yet we were seated immediately by our gracious host, the manager, Liliana Lobo.  Our server, Gerardo Tapia, was absolutely incredible!  He was watchful and ready as soon as we required attention, making our dining experience more than we could imagine.We started our evening with a Frozen Pomegranate Margarita (perfect with just the right amount of sweetness), three appetizers - the Guacamole en Molcajete made side table and prepared to the level of spice we enjoy (the best we have had - it was chunky and had tomatoes, jalapenos, cilantro, and onion), Queso Fundido served with wonderful handmade tortillas and the Ceviche de Camarones. All of them were so good, we couldn't pick our favorite.  For dinner, we shared the Chamorro, Elotes, Tres Enchiladas and Alambre de Camarones along with a side of Elotes.  The food was presented beautifully and tasted incredible.  I have to say that the Camarones (grilled jumbo shrimp) was definitely my favorite. The shrimp was prepared perfectly in a garlic vinaigrette.  For dessert, we had the Tres Leches cake and Churros.  Both were great, but I really loved the churros.  They were hot and crispy yet soft in the middle and served with two dark chocolate and raspberry-guajillo dipping sauces - out of this world.All in all, we had an amazing experience at Rosa Mexicano and can't wait to go back.",0,0,0,Marcela Grace M.,"Phoenix, AZ",132,24,7

3.0,10/21/2018,"This place; I just don't know how I feel about it. I didn't love it but I also didn't hate it. Came in around 6:30 on a Tuesday night to meet up with 3 friends for my birthday dinner. I had made a reservation the night before with no troubles. The restaurant is really pretty, cool lit up waterfalls decorating a few walls, accent lights, lots to look at. Their bar was a tight squeeze between their high top cocktail tables the bar itself. A lot of excuse me's and sorry's trying to maneuver my way around people standing at their tables while I was trying to push my way through to get to the bar. They had happy hour specials, which included some cocktails, margaritas etc and then their house wines. I didn't ask what their house wines were but usually it's cheap stuff they're selling for happy hour so I asked for the drink menu instead. I was in the mood for sparkling, it was my birthday celebration you know? I needed bubbles. Yes I know I'm at a Mexican joint, I shouldn't expect a lengthy list of prosecco and champagne options but they only had one option by the glass for $16 and while it was a hefty price it was Chandon so I figured, what the hell, it's my last year in my 20's lets ball out. Yes, $16 to spend on a glass of champagne in my eyes is balling out. So they pour me a glass, definitely a 5 ounce pour or less and it was completely flat. I brought it back to the bar and told them it was flat and they said this was because they seldom pour champagne here. Okay, not an excuse really, you should be taking inventory of your opened bottles and get rid of stuff that's been opened longer than it should. Anyways, they said they had an individual small bottle they could give me, which was fine. Also, hot damn their cocktails are expensive, all of them. $15 on average for a marg, some higher. The host brought me to our table and it was a big spacious booth for the four of us. Service was a little eh in the beginning. We waited around for a while for someone to come by to grab us drinks but eventually the service picked up and I'm thinking it was slow to start because we were waiting for the rest of our party to join us. They had a menu that was pretty eater friendly; they had vegetarian options, gluten free options, etc. For the most part. We started with their guacamole that they make ""table-side"" or off to the side in our case. They asked if we wanted it mild, medium or hot. We went with the hot and I thought it was awesome. Some of the other girls thought it was too spicy but I was all about it. Nice and chunky with cilantro and spice, yum. However, $16, overpriced, for sure. We also got the queso dip, definitely could have passed on this one, it was kind of hard. Sort of reminded me of cheese dip that was melted and then sat out at your 4 years olds birthday party for 5 hours and when you started to clean up after everyone left, the hardened consistency of the dip that nobody touched was sort of what we were served. The flavor was totally there, but the consistency was weird. Also, they only gave us one bowl of chips for two dips. More chips more fun. Entrees came out super quickly, I was surprised how fast. I went with the Hongos, per recommendation from our server. These were 3, corn tortilla tacos stuffed with grilled portobello mushrooms, black beans, red and yellow peppers, cabbage and salsa. They came with a side of creamed corn, which was not by any means indicated anywhere on the menu. First off, I hate corn, secondly, I try to stay away from dairy, thirdly, I hate anything buttery and creamy so this was a disappointing side dish, especially when I didn't know about it. They really should mention this. The tacos were weird, the flavor wasn't really up my alley, they weren't bad but they were weird. I don't have another way to describe them. My friends got tacos and enchiladas and they too agreed that they had had better and that the food was just OK. Honestly, it was expensive for what it was. I'd definitely come back here, sit at the bar for happy hour, grab a Marg and guacamole but that's it. Not a bad option, just not the best.",5,1,4,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1444,1211,1080

Dietary restrictions are serious! Thankfully the chicken wasn't mixed in/hidden in chunks, but very visible large strips atop the salad.Food: Caesar salad (meatless) was just okay, nothing to rave about. Guac (jalapeno-less) could use lemon squeeze for additional flavor. The cucumber mint mocktail was the best part - again, not amazing but light and refreshing which is exactly what I was in the mood for!Price: Total for 2 was $67 pre-tip which, for what I received, was too high.

4.0,10/6/2018,This place is very classy. Their Happy Hour menu had a good selection. The frozen Mango Margarita was on the Happy Hour Menu so I was very 'Happy'.  They give you complimentary chips with salsa and that was a plus.

For larger portions order from their regular menu.We were seated at the bar and I'm not sure if this was the bartender first day because he was all over the place and he looked flustered. He had the bare minimum eye contact we actually had to get his attention on several occasions to order another round. In spite of that - it's a great place.

3.0,9/14/2018,"I waffled between three and four stars (or taco-ed between stars? Can I make that a thing?).  Ultimately, I'd say 3.5 starts for the entire atmosphere and experience, but I can't justify rounding up to a 4 star review.We had midweek reservations for a birthday dinner after work for my husband with our couple friends.  We sat down and were handed menus, and immediately asked if we wanted to get table-side guacamole started while we perused the menus.  It was really nice that we could get guac in our bellies asap, but felt like it was a rush - also, didn't even get to look at the prices or other 'mesa' options (not that I would ever order anything that WASN'T guac, but...).  Our waiter asked what we wanted to drink in the same breath, and I ordered a traditional margarita because I hadn't had a chance to check out the menu.  My husband ordered a spicy cucumber margarita, but they brought him out a Mango Chili Marg instead - super sweet, and barely chili-flavored, for the record.  I know it was also our fault for not speaking up about the mistake, but we just went with it.The guac was aces - chunky with avocado pieces, tomatoes, cilantro, and a bit of spice in there too - we devoured it.  Since we had our drinks so early in the meal, we ended up ordering a second round before our entrees came out.  Not that I'm complaining, but the pacing of the whole meal was just slightly off.Our entrees came out, and they were decent. Nothing wrong with them, but there was nothing really right about them either.  I ordered the Tinga de Res tacos (braised beef brisket with tomatillo-habanero salsa, house-made slaw and pickled red onions) they were good, slightly spicy, but not a whole lot of wow factor.  Not sure about you, but when I'm paying $19+ for 3 tacos, I expect a modicum of wow.  The tacos were served with a corn concoction, and optically resembled a deconstructed elote dish - however it tasted like canned corn with some paprika overtop.  The corn was crunchy, so I logically understand it came off a cob in the somewhat recent past, but can't figure out that flavor - tin-ny, almost? Canlike. Strange.  Our friends were disappointed with their taco orders as well, but I didn't taste them so not too sure why.My husband ordered the Alambre de Camarones (grilled wild jumbo shrimp marinated in garlic vinaigrette with tomatoes, onions and serrano chiles, over achiote rice with a salsa verde picante).  The green sauce was pretty spicy, which I enjoyed, but the shrimp were totally bland.  Even looking at the photo, they appear to be unencumbered by any seasoning.  Not sure where this 'garlic vinaigrette with tomatoes, onions, and serrano chilies' was, either.  Pretty disappointed in this dish.  In stark contrast, the atmosphere was pretty redeeming here.  The venue is massive with 20 foot ceilings (at least), multiple rooms, a separate bar area, and a variety of seating options.  We had a booth, which was pretty high (I ended up sitting on my foot, in order to feel like I could reach the table), but it was cozy and against the wall, which I liked.   It had a very mexican-restaurant-meets-NYC-lounge vibes going on.  There was a giant water feature in the middle of the room - which vaguely looked like 'The Falling Man', more than anything else (it was the week of 9/11 so perhaps that was just on my mind).  Service was decent, slightly rushed us, but I guess that's NYC for you.  We ordered a second round of drinks and the waiter attempted to take my friends marg off the table before he finished it. Perhaps the most egregious was price.  I had mentioned we each had 2 rounds of margaritas so understandably it's not going to be a cheap dinner, but without dessert or anything fancy (our friends both ordered vegetarian tacos - one fish, one mushroom) our bill was $300.  For a weeknight dinner in NYC I'm  not expecting to get away with something cheap, and will happily treat myself to fancy-pants dinners from wonderful chefs when the opportunity presents itself.  But this was not the scenario, unfortunately.  For mediocre Mexican food, $150/couple seems astronomical for a dinner that was 'just fine'.  There are plenty (literally hundreds) of Mexican restaurants in NYC, I'd probably come back here for drinks and guacamole again - but definitely not for dinner.  You can do better.",17,7,12,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",1226,379,2328

The table side guacamole was great, and I liked that they brought out agave-lime cornbread for the table as part. As a Georgia native, I loved this refreshing twist on a Southern staple! The brunch menu overall is pretty limited as it only has six options. Most of them are some variation of tortillas/tostadas and eggs. I wanted something sweet, so I decided to go with the churro french toast. It took almost an hour for the entrees to come out. The french toast had a perfect texture -- crispy from the cinnamon on the outside and soft on the inside. The cinnamon-sugar exterior wasn't overbearing as its flavor was perfectly complemented by a blend of fresh berries and a fresh cane sugar syrup.

The waitress told me that if I ordered from the happy hour menu the quesadilla does not come with any sides.  I decided to order the quesadilla from the main menu as an app.  The quesadilla literally came with a teaspoon full of pico de gallo for $5.00 more. No lie.  No sour cream, nothing extra.  The money I spent on lunch for two fish tacos and quesadilla was not worth it.  It's a beautiful restaurant but there is nothing special about the food I ate.  They do not serve complimentary chips and salsa like me other spot.  I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and give them another try.",0,0,0,Claire P.,"East Bronx, NY",0,10,2

The hostess came back lead us to the seats that do offer happy hour which is by the bar/lounge area, cool.

Please do not talk about me in front of me, extremely rude and unprofessional. She had on a grey blazer and teal blue shirt, learn some manners girl.

I was talking and catching up with my friends and time was flying, before we know it, it's 9:20 pm and our food (has been done for hours already) is still sitting here. No one came to pick up our food or offer another drink, we hadn't seen the server in over an hour, since she brought the food. At this point I just want to leave. I got the attention of a gentleman who appeared to be the manager based off how he was dressed and he cleared the table for us and said the server was on break. I'm sorry that you're on a break but I'm at dinner, and I'm paying. Shortly after, our server appears with the check and does not apologize. Save your time, money, and good energy. This place is decorated beautifully but I believe they have way too many tables that their staff can't handle and the actual staff that ARE there do not take the effort to make your experience at dinner pleasant. I wouldn't give any stars if I could but the 1 star is for the server we could've had at the first table we were seated at in the back, he was a tall gentleman I believe his name started with a T, he was very sweet and understanding of the fact that we wanted happy hour and was glad to get us another table. Thank you for giving me a great first impression, I regret not staying at your table Sir!",0,0,0,Gabriella M.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",33,26,10

When she came back, she finally took our order which also took another 45 minutes to arrive. And then it also took 30+ minutes to get dessert...

We arrived around 6:15 on a Saturday and were told we could be seated at a normal table but that we would need to be done in 1.5 hours so that they could use it for a reservation after. Not wanting to be rushed we decided to sit in the bar/lounge. We ordered drinks and guacamole to start. The drinks were decent, and the guacamole was a good medium but had unripe avocado and lacked flavor. A good helping of salt and lime were definitely needed. The food lacked flavor, I got the vegetales dish and my bf got the fish tacos. His tacos were overloaded with cabbage and didn't really have anything else going for them.

I was very upset about that because I was looking forward to it. The pomegranate margarita is overhyped it isn't amazing. The chicken nachos were bomb I won't lie.

In addition, we ordered the quesadillas and tacos with bunch of sides like corn off the cob, roasted cauliflower, rice & beans, crispy corn tortillas that we shared for two and it was more then enough food.

The fish tacos are okay, nothing special or wowing. The steak in the Tampiquena dish was tasty. I usually don't order desserts at a restaurant but here I always get their churros which comes with two sauces on the side (chocolate and I believe raspberry).

Why don't they train their staff members to ASK if they can remove your bowls and plates from your table? Multiple staff members have removed my food without asking while I was still eating it here! The guac is great, the wine selection is great and I recommend the white sangria. It would also be nice if they put salt and pepper on the table.

I can tell you it was a ZOO in there because everyone is going for Mexican food on Cinco de Mayo!  I thought the downpours of earlier in the day would have diverted people away from celebrating, but obviously I was delusional. My friend had arrived a bit earlier and had already staked her claim near a table so once the party dining in the bar area left we could commandeer the table. We were standing for maybe ten minutes before those ladies left  and happily gave us the table before the other vultures lurking about tried to swoop down and claim it. We had the 3 feet of taco and guacamole with chips. The best ones on the taco platter  were the beef, fish and surprisingly the mushroom! the chips and guac were okay... but I am a guacamole snob so its hard to impress me in that area.  We were very full and could barely finish everything.  It was four of us in total and we are all very greedy.

A bit snarky. Not sure where he was going but it was super quiet in the restaurant. The guacamole was a 3 out of 10, stringy, with big chunks of avocado and just not much flavor, room temperature, dry, chicken fajitas served on a bed of cheese which was barely warm and a bit coagulated. Also, the taquitos were not nicely fried. The fried shell was practically chewy. The frozen pomegranate margarita was just as good as always but not saying much since it comes out of a machine.

3.0,9/15/2017,"I would rate this place as a solid 3.5. (Yelp, please add half stars)I came here with my two buddies; it wasn't the place we intended for the night, but a last minute decision. Upon entering, and being seated, I felt like I made the wrong choice. Not because the place was bad, but the decor and ambiance was more for a date, not really a place for buddies trying to cheer up another friend. However, since we were already seated and drinking water, we stayed.I would say within 30 seconds of being there, the waiter was asking us what we wanted to drink, alcohol wise. I asked him could he hold off and return in a bit. He must have took that literally, because he returned shortly thereafter, and asked again. Now I was slightly annoyed, it was relatively empty-- aside from the bar, so what's the rush? We as a group decided we would just eat because we didn't care for alcohol options. After he returned for a third time, we told him we just wanted to order dinner. The server seemed angry about this; he asked my friend three times if he wanted a drink, that's weird. (-.5). As we placed our orders, my other friend who we were trying to cheer up, asked for straws-- he was told ok, but he brushed him off twice, and finally on the third time, we were finally brought some straws (-1). The server neglected to check on the table and didn't ask if we wanted more water. We took it he was perturbed that we didn't want alcohol. The food itself was good for the most part. I opted for the enchiladas (mestiza). It was good, no complaints. My two friends ordered enchiladas and nachos de tres quesos, collectively. The nachos were really an appetizer, but he had it as an entree. We were all pleased with the food minus the rice and bean paste-- I expected real black beans, but the paste had no taste and wasn't good. The rice was sort of bland also, and a small portion for three people to share.In sum, decent food, nice decor/ambiance, especially for date, but the service we received was certainly sub-par.

Nacho's are now this prissy, structured, three layer concoction with no guac. and really chintzy on the other ingredients.  When I asked the server and other wait staff about why the change, they got real defensive and nasty with me: ""This is what it is now: You can order guac. on the side. You have not been here for a while.  This is it.""  But really defensive!  OK, OK, got it, not the old school nachos, but really do we need this weird casserole that you have to now cut with a knife and fork along with a side or attitude?

The service is also great -- we were greeted by a very friendly host and our server was exceptional.But the food is mediocre. High Five for the guacamole girl who made the most delicious appetizer. But for $15 and 2 avocados? Uh.... I felt guilty eating that.My hubs had the mole poblano enchiladas. I told him not to but he insisted. He's Mexican, he knows his stuff. He said the chicken was dry and the mole was too sweet. So I decided to taste the mole. OH GOD. It was terrible. I understand you're catering to a more Western palate, but this was the worst mole I've tasted. It was like PURE CHOCOLATE. No hint of spice at all.I wasn't very hungry so I went with the Mexican Caesar salad. It was good. Nothing special. Could use a little more spice.But while the mole was too sweet and the salad was meh, it was the side of rice and beans that made us agree we'll never come back. What restaurant raking in the dough serves up packet rice? It tastes like Uncle Ben's minute rice. No flavor whatsoever, with that hard chewy texture. Black beans were pureed so much it was like eating baby food. I don't get it. I used to like this place so much but they've become lazy with their food.",1,1,0,Rachel O.,"New York, NY",4,50,12

She took very long with our drinks any time we ordered and then when we got the check we tipped her what we felt she deserved for the service and the manager comes over to ask if everything was okay so we said yeah thinking it was just a common courtesy BUT she was actually asking about why we tipped her less than the suggested amount!!!

4.0,7/8/2017,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally got to go for dinner with a friend. The interior is quite lovely... Spacious with a waterfall wall when first stepping in, colorful walls and lights and nice window skyline with fairy lights near where we were seated. We were given the option to sit by where the kitchen was or further away from the hustle and bustle in a little corner. We went for the latter and it was a really cozy, quieter spot which allowed for easier communication.I was happy to find out that they had horchata (rice mailk drink with cinnamon) and that it was only $4.50! When it was served, it came in an adorable small pitcher and cup with ice, which was awesome because it meant more horchata. I would estimate that it equaled 2 cups of horchata. The drink tasted great as well... Lightly sweet, incredibly refreshing and plenty of cinnamon. Yummmm! We were also given complimentary chips and salsa which was very good. The chips were perfectly crispy and the salsa was a great accompaniment. For my entree, I chose their version of steak fajita which was moderately pricey at $26. It came beautifully plated with the steak sliced into bite-sized pieces, melted cheese on the bottom and onions, red + green peppers to the side, along with 3 sauces of red, white and green colors on the side of the dish. This also came with 6 corn tortilla pancakes in a hot pink container (which I loved!) and some orange Mexican rice, with mashed blue beans separate.I really enjoyed my meal. The steak was wonderfully flavorful, juicy, tender, while the vegetables were freshly grilled and the cheese was delicious. I put everything, including the rice together, along with the sour cream, in the tortilla and the ingredients really complemented each other. There was enough so that I was able to take half of the dinner home and it was just as tasty later. The service was okay. The waitress seeemed nice enough, but she, as well as others would come around quite frequently asking if we were done, which interrupted our conversation. Soon after my meal was boxed up, the waitress came wtih our bill even though we had not asked for it and my friend was thinking of getting dessert. At least after that we were not bothered or rushed to leave. I would consider coming back because I loved the horchata so much and some of the appetizers sounded really good, but I would probably try the Lincoln Center location, which I have heard is a bit fancier with good service.",10,9,10,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

The first time I was at this location, I only hung out in the bar/lounge area for happy hour. No complaints about my experience then. I can't say the same this time around. This is mostly due to the service and nothing to do with food or the establishment itself.I like the menu, and the layout of the restaurant.

I'm a big fan of their margaritas, and I often think about stopping by for happy hour if I happen to be in the area.For this visit, I came in with a friend for an early dinner reservation at 6 pm, so the restaurant wasn't too busy. I understand how demanding it can be when you're working in a busy restaurant in NYC. As a result, I let a lot of things slide when it comes to service. My problem with our waitress was that she kept constantly interrupting us throughout our meal. I believe this was an effort to rush us out. She must have come over 5-6 times. I also didn't appreciate when were speaking to her, she would attempt to finish our thought instead of hearing what we were asking of her. This sometimes led to confusion. Finally she came over and gave us our bill, but we don't recall asking for it, nor were we ready to leave. We were actually contemplating ordering desert, but after we got the bill we figured we should just take our business elsewhere.I've had dinner at the location near Lincoln center twice and thought the service was perfectly fine.

First, my server Paul placed my drink on the table not in a very proper way and got spilled on the table, he just walked away without offering a napkin to clean up the mess. And I was like... really? My entire order was:*2 drinks (mango chile and Paloma)*1 Guacamole ""to start""*1 tortilla soup*1 Budín de Pollo*1 enchiladas suizas*1 corn on the cob (my fave, yes, my fave)After a while I got the feeling that my main course was coming. I called the waiter and asked about the guacamole, about when was coming??, his answer was ''is coming in a second''. When he stepped away I noticed that he forgot and he was just telling to the lady in charge to make the guacamole. He came back to my table and told me that the lady in charge of preparing the guacamole was confused. Did he blame her? I noticed he was the one who forgot about. At this time our main courses were on the table. I called the sommelier/manager who was close to our table and I told him that the Guacamole was supposed to be my appetizer. I had to cancel the guacamole. The sommelier/manager was very polite and he apologized for the situation. I asked one of the back waiters for the paper napkin to clean the table because the drink still all over. He forgot about the napkin also. Finally I asked for the napkin to another back waiter and she help me immediately ( I couldn't her her name,""sorry"" but thank you so much) she was working in another section but she help me really fast.Our food was good, and guess what?? our server forgot to send my corn on the cob as well, (was the chef also confused about not getting the corn to our table?)  ""my fave"" remember?? yes, I mentioned the corn cob is my fave? At this point I was like well I guess this server is not well trained to do his job. I am also in the hospitality industry and last Sunday night, almost holiday when the restaurant didn't have a lot of covers at that moment for me.. it seems like it was very difficult to mess up an order. But Paul did. It seems like the level of service did not match with the standards of the other Rosa Mexicano location in Lincoln Center.",0,0,0,Miguel L C.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
5.0,5/17/2017,Great spot for happy hour and dinner. Been here plenty of times. The restaurant has high ceilings and very nicely decorated. They make fresh guacamole right in front of you. Their tacos are very good. I've had all their taco offerings and would recommend the fish and the steak as must haves. Service is great for both small and large parties. I would definitely come back.,0,0,0,Chris L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,24,4

1.0,5/3/2017,"Like another reviewer, I emailed the general manager and the chef of the Tribeca restaurant and did not receive a response. Therefore, I'm writing this review. Below is the email I sent to them. It's definitely long, but it's because we were SUPER disappointed with this location.---------I've been a huge fan of Rosa Mexicano since I moved here from Chicago in 2011. I've been to every single Rosa's location in NYC, and when my parents came to visit this weekend, we decided to try out the new Tribeca location since we had never been there before. Our hopes were very high, considering our numerous previous experiences at other Rosa locations. Unfortunately, our experience at the Tribeca location was not a satisfying one.Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by the hostess. Once we were seated, my daughter needed a diaper change. My mother and I went to the women's bathroom, assuming we would find a changing table there. When we didn't, I was preparing to change my daughter on the bench located in front of the bathrooms. A worker came out of the door next to the women's bathroom asking if we needed help with something. I asked if there was a changing table. He pointed us to the room he came out of. With all due respect, the location of the baby changing table is dangerous and inconvenient. It is located in front of an elevator and the pump room where your employees enter and exit. While changing my daughter (with the door closed), a worker came barging in needing to enter the pump room, which scared my daughter while we were changing her, and a worker on the other side needed to exit the pump room but couldn't because we were there. There is no sink for us to wash our hands, so we had to go into the women's bathroom. Needless to say, this was the most awkward, inconvenient, and dangerous location for a changing table.Once at the table, we ordered our food. The best part of our meal were the frozen margaritas. However, those of us that asked for salt with the margaritas were disappointed to see salt on the SIDE of the glass rather than on the rim of the glass. If the bartender is trying to go for a ""cool"", interesting, and creative way to serve salt with the margaritas, please tell him that it's rather annoying to get salt on your hands when picking up the glass. Does the bartender expect us to lick the side of the glass to get the salt?Everything else was not up to the typical Rosa standards. We ordered guacamole, as we've done EVERY SINGLE TIME we've gone to Rosa's, as I'm such everyone else does. Our guacamole was extremely chunky, with the avocados cut into giant square chunks, but it also lacked salt. The condiments seemed to be laid out on top rather than mixed in with the avocados. We complained to our waiter about this, and a new one was made. The new one was definitely creamier and had the right amount of salt. Our tortilla chips were stale -- there were a few chips that were soft and soggy, appearing to have gotten wet and were dried.When everyone's meal arrived, it was just one complaint after another. My father's meal, which he orders every time he visits, was too spicy and he was unable to finish it. All of our food was cold. We were eating dinner at 4pm -- there were four or five other tables, so it was not a busy dinner rush. After the bathroom ordeal and the guacamole situation, we decided not to complain to the waiter about our experience but rather to send an email directly to you.The Tribeca location was definitely our worst Rosa Mexicano experience ever. We felt that our experience was extremely disappointing considering the amount of money we were paying for the meal. We've spent a considerable amount of money every time we go to Rosa's, which we don't mind paying for a good meal, but our money was not well spent at this location.-------------",0,0,0,Samantha P.,"Glen Cove, NY",6,36,1
5.0,5/1/2017,"Finally had the chance to check out Rosa Mexicano, which I've been hearing such great things about for a long time. First things first, the ambiance and decor of this restaurant will leave you impressed long before you order your food. I went around dinner time and the lights were dim in a way that set the mood for an intimate dinner out, and the decorations around the restaurant made it seem really upscale. While I wish the food menu was a little more longer, they had everything from tacos to guac, to fill entrees. I couldn't really decide what I wanted so I got two appetizer like dishes, the chicken flautas and the shrimp quesadilla. The flautas were super delicious, and also a bit spicy because of the great sauces on top, so keep that in mind if you're not a fan of spice. The shrimp quesadilla was eh, I've had better from regular Mexican spots. My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which he said were good also. I had just a glass of wine but they have a nice selection of cocktails to choose from as well. My bf thoroughly enjoyed his margarita. I'll definitely come back here at least once more to enjoy a full entree or maybe just for happy hour, since their bar area looks amazing.",6,2,5,Robin T.,"New York, NY",294,321,668

4.0,4/13/2017,"So, my friend has a yearning for Mexican food. As soon as we land at LaGuardia we get an Uber and head over to the restaurant. It's a Thursday afternoon and they presently surprised us to get seated immediately. It is quite big and one can underestimate the size from the outside. Our server was very pleasant young man. The way time for food was pretty average. The complementary chips and salsa was excellent. The chips were fresh and the salsa spicy for our palate. We ordered the guacamole and the mistakes said to make it medium. It is really not that great. You probably have had better guacamole. I ordered the salmon and my friend ordered chicken fajitas. The salmon with green sauce was excellent. I was not sure how it would be with the kale but it was delicious. The chicken was juicy and quite flavorful. We ordered the caramelized flan for dessert again which was not pretty good.Overall it was a very good experience. The ambience is very nice it's a good place to have a date or a quick bite.

5.0,4/10/2017,I always enjoy my time at Rosa. My favorite part is ordering guacamole because they make it table side and you can customize your spice level.

Not the super most attentive waiters, sometimes you have to flag them down or remind them to refill your water, but decent all around.

I made a reservation for 7:15pm, and was seated right away when my friend got there.When we were seated, we got chips and salsa, and were immediately asked if we would like a drink. I wish I got the waiter's name, but he was very funny and accommodating to my dietary restrictions. The bottom of the menu says if you are looking for gluten free or vegetarian options to ask your server, so I asked for a vegetarian menu. It took me awhile to decide what I wanted because it all sounded delicious.The waiter pointed out some of his favorite dishes from both menus; I ended up getting the vegetarian salad, and my friend got the quesadilla.Both meals were great, and we were in and out in a little over an hour.

We had a brace of their very excellent pomegranate frozen margaritas to start us off which, it has to be said, are strong and not for the faint-hearted. Another speciality is their guacamole made to order at the table which, unsurprisingly, is fresh (duh!) and delicious. As we were hungry we also had an order of nachos to share which were equally good. For mains I had a pretty good beef tortilla which was more than adequate while my companions had, respectively steak and chicken dishes, again reportedly excellent. Against my better judgement, I finished with a really good Pinot Noir which, alas, caught up with me the following day. An all-round good experience.

They seem pricey at $13 until you remember you're in Manhattan.Figured I'd order some enchiladas while I'm here and went with the chicken suiza. The food came out extremely fast.. Either that or I lost track of time while munching on their chips and salsa. The enchiladas were drenched in sauce and I thought it would be overkill, but the flavors and spices blended nicely.

Even though the place was packed, the noise level was just fine for two people to have a conversation. If we weren't so stuffed we would have gotten dessert. Man, I wish we had dessert.

I like the Rosa Mexicana brand and this location is spacious and lovely with great service.The jalapeño margarita was spicy but bland. I don't like too much agave or sour mix in drinks, especially when they're priced at $13 each. I was looking for something a little more cocktail-y.For my entree, I just ordered a chicken tortilla soup. It was pretty good and the avocado was a nice touch. I wish there was more broth and less tortilla strips. Though, I get it. Tortilla is kind of the name of the game.Speaking of tortillas, they don't give you chips for the table. Which is kind of a blessing in a way. Just know this is a Mexican spot on the classier end.

Super uncommon to see a large restaurant of this size in Manhattan. Our server was extremely sweet and frequently came back to check up on us. We started with guacamole and empanadas - phenomenal! The appetizers were definitely my favorite course of the night. I then followed with the shrimp while my cousin got the steak. While the entrees were both good, we weren't wow'd. I felt like my shrimp was bland and could have been seasoned to add more flavor. Our third course was dessert and we had to try both the tres leches and the churros.

The happy hour in the bar is no longer seven days. They made it two hours instead of four. They got rid of the pitchers on the happy hour menu. And the nachos no longer have any flavor. For someone who is in the restaurant several times a week, I think it's in bad taste to never have the manager come by to say ""hello"" or even ask if everything is ok. Since Mark and Steven came into the picture, only Lily and Jeff will ever say hello without being provoked by a customer. On a night that is not so busy, I have watched Mark sit in the back room (where no customers are) and stare at his phone when he could be coming by people's tables to see if everything is ok. If he's not there he is out back having a cigarette. One night when the bar was disastrously crowded and one waitress was missing, he did not even offer to lend a hand and ask if the waitresses needed help.

I had a bite of chorizo sausage and it was little bit salty but was good too. (Honestly speaking, I was already full from guacamole and appertizer. Hahaha)Dessert: Again, I thought I need to pick either ""Churros"" or ""Tres Leches"" but they served 1 churros per person and 2 cakes to share.Overall, it was great place to go on New Year's Eve :)",1,0,1,Miyuki A.,"New York, NY",78,113,1827

5.0,12/21/2016,"Well I have to say they pulled off an awesome holiday party. On a Monday night in December it was pretty crowded but it did not take anything away from our event, which was in the sky room East.It was set up beautifully with two hightops and a couple perimeter tables... There was a guacamole station that had the biggest mountain of guacamole you ever saw in your life with a flowing lava of chips. It was a hit. The two servers Enrique and Joaquin were so friendly and attentive they were walking around with pomegranate margaritas and regular margaritas all night long-  no one had to ask for a drink they were there the second you needed something. And they were there with a smile on which makes all the difference in the world. The passed hors d'oeuvres were delicious everyone loved them & the variety - definitely go with the shrimp cocktail because the shrimp are humongous and fresh. People almost didn't even have enough room for the main course which were two stations, one taco station with three options and a quesadilla station with three options. I wish I had saved more room because the tacos and quesadillas were out of this world, and having someone cook them fresh for you at your party was a nice touch.After the party everyone came up and said what a nice job I did organizing it and how much fun it was but I 100% know that it was the establishment because I've done a party with them before at a different location and they really know what they're doing. The hors d'oeuvres were passed for an hour straight, no one was wanting of anything and the drinks were passed all night long, and you could request special drink if you wanted to.There was a festive background music, the room was decorated beautifully and besides for the food being amazing everything went off without a hitch. I highly recommend having a holiday party here a company party here any type of event here - they do an amazing job!!!",2,0,1,Rebecca W.,"Palm Beach Shores, FL",754,139,422

I also really like the chicken taquitos, the chorizo queso fondue, the chicken tortilla soup, and there salmon and kale dish. All of there food is very tasty along with there drinks. There signature pomegranate drink is my favorite. They also have a mango option which I like to order during the summer months. The service here is great.

The slight scent of chlorine from the huge fish tanks permeates the space. Effective blue decor nonetheless.The complementary bowls of rice and black bean puree were a welcome gesture, considering the prices here aren't cheap. The appetizers are rather on a small side, so be prepared to be shocked at first. Empanadas were delicious but only two tiny pieces for $11 dish.Main courses are filling, however. The chicken enchiladas covered with green sauce, plenty of melted cheese and veggies very huge and extremely filling, leaving no room for dessert.

They have a large menu and tons of different margarita flavors to choose from. They also have pretty big round tables, so I would highly recommend coming here with bigger groups. The menu was so big it can be tough to choose what to order! We started out with the nachos and of course margaritas for the table. I ordered the frozen mango margarita. It was delicious! The whole table loved the frozen margaritas so I would recommend ordering these. The nachos were also really good. They weren't too messy and had a lot of flavor. I got the shrimp tacos for my main dish. They were one of my favorite shrimp tacos that I've had. So good! The shrimp was crispy and so flavorful. They give you 3 tacos and also corn and rice and beans. The corn was amazing. You can't come here without eating this corn. It was one of my favorite things about the dish. The meal was huge and there was no way I could finish it. If you're not overly starving, this is certainly a meal that could be shared between two people.

Its delicious and as fresh as it can get. Sangria is just like it should be. Not overly sweet, full with fruits, could taste triple sec in it it was nice. After eating bowls of guac and chips, we got our meals on a skillet. It was really good no complaints and the mexican donut was fresh outta the oven.

There was a sprinkling of kale dust on top and some onions, but really it was a cheese enchiladas in a rather simple red sauce. Nothing great really.

My husband had to go frequently to check if our table was ready and they kept saying it will be soon and it will be our turn when the next table is available. The hostesses were socializing instead of keeping customers updated. While waiting we saw many customers arrive (same party of two) and they were seated immediately so we were wondering why we had to wait for so long when we had a reservation. People arriving after us were seated immediately so why they lied to us saying that we will be next. We were hungry and tired of waiting so my husband approached to inform that we were leaving. Upon hearing that the hostess immediately said that our table was ready. Seriously???? We had to say we were not willing to wait any longer to get their attention?

They definitely care about the quality of their drinks, and don't go cheap on the alcohol. We ordered the three course meal with a side of Guacamole and chips, the guac is made in front of you which is pretty cool. So it's very fresh and tastes great. We devoured the guac in less than 10 mins. I had the ceviche (aptzr )mahimahi(entrée) and tres leches (desert). The ceviche was good but missing the hint of lime/lemon.

Good news is that it was prepared well.  The entrees all were good but nothing unique or special to write about and that goes for all 8 entrees.  The list of tequilas and mezcals was strong although the wine selection was lacking.  There is a definite need for some stronger selections to match the chic feel of this place as people are clearly spending the money so add another 30 solid bottles.  If you want good Mexican food with a unique, trendy atmosphere then come here.",0,1,0,Christian S.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,14,0
4.0,7/15/2016,"If I had come here a month ago, I would have given Rosa five stars without hesitation.  But someone's already stolen that fifth star: Aarón Sanchez.I first saw Aarón on Chopped and identified with his obsession over flavor.  During the judges' showdown, he'd throw three ingredients in a blender and, twenty minutes later, have the other judges cooing like babies behind the chopping block.It was around that time that I was becoming fascinated with the diversity of Mexican food so I bought Aarón's most recent cookbook.  And that permanently sealed the fate of the fifth star.  The recipes in the book are based on simple sauces and salsas that take a blender and roughly chopped ingredients to make.  But once they're made, they can be used in a million ways.  Last week, I made shrimp curry, a chicken sandwich, a marinaded steak, and a burrito using just a few spoonfuls of just ONE sauce.No restaurant can compete with this.Having said that, Rosa was fantastic.  First, the table side guacamole.  It was the best guacamole I've ever tasted and even though my girlfriend's parents were there, I ate as much of it as I could.  I considered sword-fighting her dad with the ladle at one point to get the last of it.  With the guacamole came tortilla chips, a deep red chipotle salsa, and a salsa verde.  Both were delicious and the chipotle salsa was hot.  Salsa verde doesn't have to be hot but it had a decent kick too.  These alone were worth it, but the food that came after was great too.Unlike my girlfriend and I, her parents usually get starters and we were invited to order starters.  I ordered the empanadas.  They were stuffed with chicken and cheese and came with a mysterious but delicious dipping sauce.  They were some of the best empanadas I've ever had.  Even the greasiness of the shell didn't bother me.  My girlfriend's stepmom ordered a ceviche and let me taste it.  When it hit my tongue, it exploded into citrusy ecstasy and had me nodding vigorously and wide-eyed with approval at stepmom, who nodded back in agreement.After this tantalizing intro, it was time for the main course.I ordered the Tinga de Res, three loaded beef tacos with pickled onions on top.  They came with a side of spicy cream corn with a creamy concoction.  The taco meat was delicious but it could have used more seasoning.  I would suggest asking the waitress for more of the salsas that came with the chips and pour some of that on the tacos to bring everything together.  The corn was creamy and had a cayenne pepper bite to it.  This is where a little bit of Aarón Sanchez's magical sauces and bases would have been particularly useful.  That's the only complaint I have, though because the portions were huge and I had enough left over for a midnight snack.Then we ordered dessert and I reached a whole new level of fatassery.  I got the flan while the in-laws-to-be got the chocolate ice cream.  The flan was in-goddamn-credible.  It had a nutmeg flavor plus some other unidentifiable spice to it that just elevated it into the orgasmic zone.  Luckily, girlfriend's parents were trying their best to make me feel comfortable and said I shouldn't be shy.  They also let me finish their chocolate ice cream.  What choice did they have?  The flan and ice cream had dyed my mustache brown and I had my spoon poised like a surgeon holding a scalpel.I didn't need any urging.  I massacred both desserts shamelessly.After a certain amount of eating, you're too far in to care about your girlish figure anymore.  That's when you go, ""Fuck it,"" and enjoy yourself.  All four of us had reached that point.  The three of them were fighting food comas and I didn't even bother sucking in my stomach anymore.  I exhaled, letting it fall forward and hit the table with a ""whomp.""No five stars thanks to Aarón, but it was a thoroughly pleasurable experience.  The guac, starter, and desserts were perfect, and the entree was pretty good too.  Clearly my in-laws were more comfortable with me if they were encouraging me not to be shy and, most importantly, I was full.  An old Irish saying goes, 'After a full belly all is poetry.'I realize how true this is every time I have a meal as satisfying as the one I had at Rosa Mexicano.",1,2,0,Prateek S.,"Boston, MA",118,186,721

It got more crowded as the night went on, but around 6, it was vacant. It's a huge restaurant and really nicely decorated. It's a great place for groups due to the size of the restaurant.The booths are super weird though, the height of the tables is totally off so you literally feel like a baby. So if you have short people in the group, ask for a regular table. However, when we asked for a table and they put us directly next to the waiter station.... the place was empty, there were much better seats available.We ordered the table-side guacamole which  just appeared at our table in a bowl... no one made it table side, which obviously makes it taste better --- so that was a disappointment. But the guac was pretty good and had a nice kick to it. The margarita was good and pretty strong. As always with Mexican places, there was a good amount of vegetarian/pescatarian options!

From what I'd heard, the atmosphere was the draw but I never actually heard much about the food.... So this was to be interesting.The restaurant itself is pretty big, making it ideal for groups. To start, guacamole is offered, which is also made table side. I was with a group so we got one spicy and one regular. I'm not a big fan of guac in general, but this was hands down the best guac I've ever had in my life. The spice was perfect and not overwhelming, and it was mixed perfectly while not being too chunky. This was the highlight of the meal and I could have easily eaten a few more bowls to myself.From there I had an order of the Carnitas, which is braised pork that comes with cilantro, onions and pineapple. It was good, but I found it to be a little on the dry side. While the mixture with the pineapples made it tasty, it definitely wasn't on par with the guac heaven that I had just eaten. Overall his place is def worth coming to, especially with a group.

In fact, you will definitely see people ordering the fresh guacamole that is made by the waiters/waitresses. Employees:  While I arrived here to meet a few colleagues, the waiter had informed us that we could eat, but needed to leave in a hour because someone else was going to have a table.  We concurred.  The irony of it all was the fact that he wanted to rush out us, but he took forever to take our check, provide us with our menus, and then returning my credit card.  Oh well.  After that we took the party to the bar where the waitress was very accommodating and nice!   So overall, I would say the service is a toss-up.Food: My boyfriend and I shared the nachos and we were both hungry.  It's amazing what a huge batch of nachos could do to make you feel full with less money.  It was delicious, just wished that the avocado and sour cream were more apparent that it was there instead of buried underneath all of the top nachos.Drinks: Mango Margarita - Blended cold drinks with salted spicy rim always takes my mouth to higher levels of joy and satisfaction.Cost: It is mostly cheap when you come here for happy hour.  Other then that, it's quite expensive.",5,1,1,Jonathan V.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1260,244,418

Welp, I found myself at Rosa Mexicano for cocktails one Saturday night. My friend and I went for the carafe of sangria, which roughly equated to 2 1/2 glasses. I ordered red, my friend ordered white. I was underwhelmed. There was nothing amazing about the sangria, in fact, I wasn't eager to finish my beverage. We also ordered guac for the table. One thing I will say is that Rosa Mexicano SLAYS their guac. I was VERY pleased with the quantity, flavor and presentation (if you're into that sort of thing.) So what's my deal with Rosa Mexicano? I feel like they're just not the place to go if you want delicious Mexican food. I like to refer to Rosa Mexicano as the Olive Garden of Mexican eats.

2.0,4/25/2016,"This restaurant transported me... to middle America (I've had better there, actually). We went here for lunch, on a Sunday. And note that I just said ""lunch on a Sunday"" because they do NOT serve brunch for some reason. Apparently they don't understand that New Yorkers eat brunch on the weekends and they actually just had a comical a two-item ""breakfast"" menu. Ok. So, immediately when we walk into the mostly empty restaurant, I'm asked to give my full name and contact info to create a reservation. When I asked why, I was told by the host that it's ""just a quirk here, we won't contact you."" It was extremely unsettling and set up the whole experience to be just... lackluster and weird. I guess they know who I am now, full name too, so that's fun.We were placed in the center of this huge cave-like restaurant, and since we already glimpsed the menu outside, rejected our waiter's offer for an order of guacamole (it's $15, which they feel they can justify by making it at your table)... At that point, *he 100% gave up on our table.* Period. We were given a bowl of thin, unsalted chips, as if to really make us consider our decision to not order the $15 guacamole performance. As an afterthought, maybe 5 minutes later, we were given two sad dishes of some frankly not very good salsa, as to seemingly *further* punish us, yet again, for not ordering the $15 guacamole performance. We decided to not order drinks because we really wanted to just eat and get out of there ASAP. I couldn't even consider drinking in such a dull and unwelcoming environment. I ordered the migas (literally just scrambled eggs) and my dining mate ordered some enchiladas as our waiter *wouldn't even make eye contact with us.* We got our food which was edible, and we got rice and beans, and that's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 star. The waiters (all men btw) all seemed to be really good friends with each other - just not super professional as they were loitering around joking as we waited for our plates to be cleared. All in all, if you want to go to a stale, sad environment, where you feel like the waiters don't even feel confident enough in the food they're serving to give you the time of day if you don't order guacamole and drinks, come here I guess.

Sadly, after a long wait, a hastily put together, surprisingly small bowl of guacamole arrived at our table. We asked about the table-side... And we were informed ""we don't do that in the bar"". All told we had one nasty bar brand margarita and a small cup of guacamole for $30.  Strike two. You expect the high price, but you would hope to get some semblance of service and accuracy.  Oh, and forget about hoping for a little flavor.  The guacamole lacked any effort and was anything but spicy.  Strike three.

Nothing against the spectacular staff at this location as we've been coming to happy hour here for years because of the great great deals and the incredibly friendly servers (Natalia is a gem) but now the unthinkable has happened: they've jacked the price up. For someone who can just afford to treat ourselves to the happy hour prices here in the most expensive city on earth an $8.00 margarita (a $2.00 jump in price, jeez, can't even ease us into it) is NOT a great happy hour price!!!! Sure the original $6.00 price was remarkably affordable but it's the reason they are PACKED every day for happy hour. The new $8.00 price tag is such a bummer.

We ordered a variety of appetizers so that the kids could try a little of everything along with their Children's menu choices and the Queso Fundito and Shrimp Ceviche were surprising kid pleasers!  Thank you Rosa Mexicano for making our staycation a great one!  We will be back...all four of us.",0,0,0,Nancy F.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
4.0,2/22/2016,"Extremely large restaurant down in the Flatiron/Union Square area.  You walk in, and you immediately feel like you're in some large club, minus the crazy EDM music, but the ambiance, decor, and space is definitely cool and unique.  There's a small host/hostess stand immediately to the right, when you walk in, and then all around you there are tables and people.  The high ceilings make this place look even more large, but they tend to be packed, so it's always busy (but not too crazy).  My roommate and I came on a Friday night around 930 for dinner and we were able to get seated immediately.We got seated kind of in the front of the restaurant, and I didn't get a chance to check out the back, but they have a back dining room that looks pretty fun and vibrant.  We were sitting to the right of the large waterfall wall, with little swimmer action figures and cool lights.  There are some booths that are right next to the waterfall, which seem like they'd be comfortable places to sit, eat, and enjoy dinner with friends.When we got seated, we got water and our waiter asked if we were ready for our drink order.  Not surprising, but they have a large tequila list!  I love spicy margaritas and ordered their Mango Chile margarita and asked the waiter to ask the bartender to make it as spicy as they can.  Our waiter recommended swapping out the tequila they use and getting this jalapeno tequila to add more spice, if that's what we wanted.  That was courteous of him to offer and my roommate and I both decided on that option.  The margarita itself was OK...kind of small in my opinion, but we were satisfied nonetheless.The complementary chips arrived first and they were warm and a bit salty - pretty good.  It also came with two salsas - a red/brown smoky salsa with not a huge flavor profile, but it adds a nice richness to whatever you add it on (that's not a chip).  The other salsa is green and we thought it would be similar to salsa verde, but we were wrong!  My roommate and I ended up getting about 3-4 bowls of this salsa because we really liked it - he definitely liked it more than I did, but it was tasty and slightly spicy.Here's what we ordered:Nachos (appetizer) - we were debating about the guac, but ended up getting the nachos and I'm glad we did.  It is a good portion and plenty to share between 2-4 people.  We ate most of it - the pico de gallo they put on top was good, but it was all over the place and a bit messy, as nachos tend to be.  The chips stayed crispy for the most part, but obviously the ones covered in cheese and the pico started to get a little soggy.  The fresh jalapenos to the dish are a nice touch, and we added that green salsa to the chips too.Enchiladas Ranchero (vegetarian) - the cool thing about Rosa Mexicano is that they do have plenty of vegetarian options (even a vegetarian menu online).  My roommate and I split two dishes, this being one of them.  I was underwhelmed by these.  For starters, the ranchero sauce tasted like watered-down Ragu tomato sauce...it was pretty bland and didn't taste authentic.  The enchilada itself was also simply a tortilla and cheese...not much else to it, and the sauce didn't add a lot of flavor, so overall the dish was bland.  When I mixed it with the rice and beans, it tasted better, but not something I'd recommend to fellow vegetarians (or people looking to get this dish).  The chile rellenos sounded good, but we didn't get it.Veggie Quesadilla - given that we knew we were going to be semi-full from the nachos, we decided on a smaller second dish to share - the quesadilla.  It comes in an appetizer portion, but our waiter mentioned he could add some veggies into it and make it a bit larger for us, again - very thoughtful.  These quesadillas were pretty good - the tortilla was grilled nicely and I'm so glad they didn't overstuff them, which tends to happen.  Many restaurants feel the need to put loads of veggies and cheese to make up for the fact that there's no meat, but all that does is cause the quesadilla to get extremely soggy and lose it's freshness and taste.  This one had a nice mix of cheese and veggies, with neither overpowering the dish, and some guac and salsa to eat it with.  I'd definitely recommend this one.Overall, a solid dinner place where you can definitely take a group of friends and have an awesome time.  Their ambiance is cool, laid-back, and fun.",2,1,1,Sunny S.,"Philadelphia, PA",136,386,145

Although it is great to enjoy happy hour at any time I do believe their options could be a little better. They had the basics....tacos, quesadillas, etc. but I think they could do more. Now as for the pomegranate Margarita and the guac.......AMAZING!!!! The margarita is hands down EXCELLENT. Very strong and you can feel the effects after the first one.

The sign outside is very bright and flashy, but the interior is actually just bright, cheery and overall very elegant/grand. I came here on a Sunday right when they opened and it was fairly empty. Our group of 7 was seated at a big round table, which was nice. We started with the guacamole, which they made fresh on the spot. I really appreciated that they made sure all sides of the table were supplied with chips and salsa so that we didn't have to reach across each other. The guac tasted exactly like it looked: straight out of the avocado-delicious! For the main course I split some fish tacos and chicken empanadas. The empanadas were SO GOOD. The outer shell was softer than most empanadas I've had, which actually worked very well. The chicken was well seasoned and I really liked the sour/spicy sauce that they came with. The fish tacos were also solid. The fish was soft and it was mixed with what seemed like some sort of pickled cabbage. I also got their signature frozen pomegranate margarita, which did not disappoint. It was sweet but not overwhelmingly so and strong but not to the point of headache-inducing. Service was friendly and prompt: We told them that we had a one hour time limit and they made sure to get everything done within that time frame.

There was really cool electric blue decor on the wall behind us. The waitress was really attentive and friendly and constantly refilled our chips. We got their corn and the empanada appetizer - so soft and doughey, I wanted to order more but needed to save up for the movie popcorn. Their margaritas were good but not out of this world. They mixed up one with a flavored marg instead of the classic. Regardless, it was an overall really great experience and I can't wait to go back!

1.0,11/1/2015,"The thing that ruined this experience was the server. Chris was absolutely terrible. He introduced himself when we were seated, gave us the menu, and then was not seen or heard from for literally 20 minutes. When he finally came to take the drinks order, he forgot my boyfriend's drink but did not bring it for another 15 mins. After eating, we looked for him for another 10 mins before finally spotting him, and asked for the bill. We wanted to split the bill evenly between 4 credit cards, but this idiot charged my boyfriend for the ENTIRE MEAL. We only knew because my boyfriend saw the charge pop up in the notifications on his phone. So we waited for Chris to come back to see if he'd tell us he had made that mistake. He didn't. He just handed us the receipts and tried to leave, and when we stopped him to ask about it he said ""ohh yeah I already reversed it."" I mean really? Even if you refunded it, it would take a few days to go through, and you didn't even have the decency to tell us you mistakingly charged $200 on a card?

4.0,7/29/2015,"I came here for dinner last week with a friend. We had a 7:15 reservation but we both finished work early and wanted to catch the end of happy hour so we showed up at 6:45 instead. Sidenote: I definitely recommend making a reservation that allows you to catch happy hour- margaritas are only $6 (instead of $12!) and you can bring them from the bar to your table. That being said, one of the hostesses gave us a hard time for getting there early and said we had to wait until 7:15 to sit down, even though the restaurant was only halfway full. She was also quite rude. We went to the bar and when we came back, there was a different host. He could not have been more friendly and immediately let us sit down even though it was not yet 7:15. We ordered guacamole for the table and it's one of those places that makes it to your specifications and even had a special guac cart. We assumed that they would prepare it in front of us, but they didn't- I'm not sure if this is always the case or not but worth noting. It was definitely good, but since everyone talks about how amazing I think I was expecting it to be a little better. They also provided chips and salsa for the table- the chips were super tasty and fresh but the salsas were a little weird. One was green (which is usually my favorite) but so spicy you almost couldn't eat it and the other kind of tasted like barbecue sauce which was odd. I ordered the enchiladas suizas (green/tomatillo sauce) and they were incredible. This type of dish is my favorite and I order it every time I get Mexican. I have to say, the one I had at Rosa is in my top 5 (if not top 3) EVER. The green sauce was absolutely amazing- it was so flavorful and delicious and also had a slightly creamy consistency which I liked. I seriously can't say enough good things about the dish and I'm still dreaming about it a week later. They also serve rice and beans family style and they were very good too. The portions are really big and my friend and I filled up on chips and guac so we both took our food home. The waitress gave us an additional serving of the rice and beans so we could each take some home which I thought was extremely nice. The leftovers were also really good heated up the next day which is always a plus.

We all wanted to order another bowl, but we thought we might get too full before the entrees came. Next we decided to get the Sangria, so we got the 60 oz pitcher for the table. The Sangria was another homerun! I love Sangria and this was by far the absolute best! For our entrees, I got the Baja Tacos, my friends got the mahi mahi, the salmon, and my other friend got the Baja tacos as well. The Baja Tacos were fresh and super tasty. I got some plaintains and creamy spinach as sides and they were both good... The salmon was tasty, but the mahi mahi did not look apppetizing to me so I passed when my friend offered a sample. I probably wouldn't order the mahi mahi... Anywayz, for dessert we ordered the fried ice cream and the banana split. The fried ice cream was awesome and a must have the next time I visit.

The nachos were delicious and the frozen margaritas were tasty.Then an older gentleman came up to our table and said ""Hey ladies, can I get some of these things out of your way?"" My boss and I stared at him for a moment. My boss is female, so okay, but I am a 6 foot tall male (with a beard, I might add). In our silence he turns to me and says ""oh, your shirt threw me off."" It's a patterned button down. He takes the plates and leaves. Sure, I wasn't offended but it was still a very peculiar exchange that did not even include a simple ""sorry.""Our server comes back around and we tell her about the exchange. She apologizes and then tells us she's not sure what she should say so she tells us she will go get the manager. Fine, if you must. We decide it would be a good idea to let them know so this older gentleman isn't making comments to other people. About ten minutes later she walks back over with the man who made the comments. He asks us ""how's everything?"" and we say ""fine"" because quite frankly it's awkward and we don't want to talk to him. And then the waitress tells us that HE is the manager!! I couldn't believe it. He then says ""yes, so I heard there was an issue?"" And my boss says ""well, yeah your comments earlier were kind of rude."" And he says ""what? You want some free drinks or something?"" I laugh because I can't believe that's his response. We tell him no, that isn't the point but he winds up walking off and telling our server to give us a free round.She comes back to us and apologizes again. Something he still hadn't done. Tells us she's going to bring us another round. We tell her we just want the check. She comes back with the check and two drinks which is nice but unnecessary since we want to just leave now. Also, to boot, the drinks aren't even the same ones we had been ordering! They were watered down, crap margaritas!Will never, ever go back.

4.0,6/30/2015,"My boss set up this lunch as a ""thank you"" to the staff and to celebrate the start of summer. Since we were a group of 16, he had to work with the catering dept to have our own set menu of three courses.First up was of course their amazing guacamole. I love avocado so I find it hard to mess up guacamole - whether a version is too spicy/not spicy enough/etc, it's base is avocado and avocado is delicious no matter what. In any case, the guacamole here is one of the best. When you start to eat, there's a hint of spice, but as you get towards the bottom of the molcajete, it gets spicier due to the well seasoned stone.Second was a mixed green salad which was tasty with the usual tomatoes, raw onions in a balsamic dressing.The main course, we had a choice of steak tacos, vegetable enchiladas or chicken. I had the vegetable enchiladas which were good - three big tortillas filled with mushrooms, zucchini, peppers and onion in a tomato-based sauce. Usually enchiladas are smothered in cheese but this wasn't which I thought was nice. There was rice and beans for the table - these were just OK - they gave out very small bowls of these for such a large group. In retrospect, it's better to have eaten most of my entree than to fill up on rice and beans.Dessert was perfectly fried, crunchy and crisp churros and three sauces: dark chocolate (very good, you can tell they use quality choco), caramel (also good, and not too sweet) and my favorite - tart raspberry.The service was good - our waiter was nice and the food came out quick. The only recommendation I have is to not take the food away so quickly. There was still salad left on the platters and chips as well. (Yes, I will scrape every bit of guacamole off the mocaljete!)The space is beautiful - we sat in the back room where you can probably rent out for a party - doors to close the room off from the main dining area, large lights, brightly painted and well decorated.

The place had a cute atmosphere, but there are much better Mexican places around.Food review:Guacamole tastes bland! I was so disappointed since the presentation was fun. It could use some more like it onion or salt!Same with the Mexican Street Corn... It's covered in some type of aioli but just doesn't have enough flavor. It's missing some lime juice or seasoning which I usually find at other Mexican restaurants.The Ceviche de Camarones is alright. I feel like you can't really go wrong with shrimp and citrus juice, but I wish the ceviche was a variety mix of other fish with the shrimp and had more juice!The traditional margarita is a bit too strong for my liking! The tequila overpowers the other flavored so it's hard to enjoy. Though I'm aware I might be the only person who'd complain about a stiff margarita...I love Mexican food so much and want to give this place another chance - they've got a few other good items on the menu, so I'll likely come back to try some but I'm not hopeful my mind will change.",1,0,1,Annaliese B.,"Manhattan, NY",93,34,1

I love it because you can go casual and it's fine or you can really dress up too. Highly recommend the Sangria! We like spicey food but we went here on June 20th and they have kicked up the spices!

The margaritas weren't bad but, given how mediocre the rest of the meal was, I wouldn't recommend making a special trip here JUST for the drinks.

4.0,6/22/2015,"Hello, Happy Hour :)To start off, this place is huge - and beautiful! The interior is decorated well and is very colorful. They have some higher end finishes. I like that they have a separation between the dining and bar area, as well as a waiting area out front with comfy couches and chairs. Service was great! My boyfriend and I met up with 3 of our friends there. Unintentionally, we all ended up ordering things one by one - the guac and some drinks first, then more drinks, then the $5 quesadilla, then drinks,then the queso fundido, then more drinks when our server came back with that, etc. Our server was very attentive and friendly, even with all the people there. She clearly had a lot of other tables to attend to, but we never had to wait too long for her to come back and check up on us. Props to her! Aside from that, the drinks came out pretty quickly, our waters were refilled often and our plates cleared off. The food is the only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars. Then again, I only tried out the bar food! I'll have to come back :) I had high expectations for the guac after reading so many reviews. I wasn't as impressed as I would've liked. Presentation was great (and I saw that they make it table side in the dining area). It wasn't as creamy as I would've liked, and it had a bit of spice to it. The queso fundido (with sausage on the side since one of my friends is vegetarian) came out nice and hot. However, it was oily and a little too salty for my taste. The frozen mango margaritas were good, but nothing special. The white wine sangria was nice and sweet, but felt like it had some seltzer in it? Not a huge fan of that. The food was good, just not absolutely amazing in my opinion. Still a cool spot to check out if you're in the area!",1,0,0,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",446,352,1499

We went, and we didn't.First, the good - server was lovely and couldn't have been more attentive. The guacamole was terrific and it was fun watching it put together tableside. But that's it.The rest - very loud. If you want to talk to your dinner companion, this isn't the place. It's fun for people watching, though. The food, truly not great. I got the tortilla soup and it was like no other tortilla soup I've ever had. It had a strange burnt-on-purpose flavor, almost more like French onion soup that tortilla soup.Companion had carne asada tacos - it was what you'd call a fajita at any other restaurant. It was fine, nothing to write home about. But I did love the black beans he got with it.It's a great space, huge by NYC standards, and the massive skylight was really very cool. Lighting was amazing, too. But companion knows audio - he says the place would truly benefit from an acoustical treatment.

All tasted great including the bowl. While I clamored for liquor my last visit and while I get the play on words (Pinot project wine at the taco project, the wine wasn't that hot.

5.0,4/10/2015,"This restaurant is great! I was originally invited by a friend, who referred to it as ""okay"" and cited his reason for choosing it as ""conveniently located"". It made me worry about what I was walking into. I had preconceived notions of a substandard, decrepit takeout place - boy, was I wrong!The atmosphere is very relaxing. One thing I despise is to worry about having throngs of people pressed up against me while I try to enjoy my dinner, and music blaring in my ear while I try to have a conversation. The restaurant is spacious, with attractive, modern décor. The lighting is a perfect balance for enjoying a variety of occasions - a family dinner, a romantic date, an energetic night out with friends. This restaurant is appropriate for any type of scenario, without being overwhelming in any way.The staff is courteous and energetic. I came on a busy night, and my server still managed to be very attentive to my table!Now, to the best part - the guacamole! Fresh - made at your table. You can choose how spicy you want it prepared, even. I'm a nacho maniac, and theirs are simply amazing - a variety of melted cheeses, generous amounts of sour cream and guac, heaping piles of toppings. There's no shortage to the portions here. I love dipping sauces and spicy food, so their house-made spicy dipping sauces made me even more ecstatic!Their cocktails are exquisite. You'd think it's difficult to make a Cosmopolitan improperly, but I've become accustomed to expecting one that someone accidentally made with rum, or has a one-second house pour: not here! Their drinks are strong and contain the proper ingredients.This is one restaurant that simply does not skimp on quality OR quantity. Although I would not consider it ""upscale"", it is a tad more expensive than your typical Mexican joint. I love holes-in-the-wall that are budget-friendly toward a broke college student, but every now and then, I can't resist the urge to spoil myself by coming here!

The bar was, perhaps predictably, a little bit of a drunk-fest (it was 830pm, a mere 1.5 hours past happy hour after all) but the atmosphere was lively, happy, and fun.BF had the Unica marg and I had the standard frozen lime marg. These were just downright great margaritas. We ordered some chips and salsa (fresh, hot, and great salsa) and then queso fundido with chorizo. The highlight of the food was the corn tortillas that came with the fundido-- corn tortillas are hard to master but these were delicious and soft (probably a hybrid flour-corn, but oh so tasty). The fundido (literally a skillet of melty cheese) with chorizo was shockingly underwhelming. Bland, no spice in the chorizo... just meh. Wouldn't order it again, but after a marg or two, you definitely eat it.Overall, a fun spot, but don't expect an exceptional Mexican culinary experience, expect to get marged-up.",0,0,0,Hannah S.,"New York, NY",11,37,5

You can't go wrong with that! I truly enjoyed their guacamole. It is $14 but extremely worth it. It is fresh and made for you table side. The mango margaritas were nice and strong too.

We then had to try the guacamole we had heard so much about because they make it right in front of you. It was very fresh and delicious and we asked for it to be made mild, which it was. I had the enchiladas suizas, which had chicken in them and were very tasty. The sauce on them was a bit spicy, which I didn't expect, so I was drinking a lot of cold water! My friends ordered a different kind of enchilada and they said the cheese one was the best (theirs had three different ones on a plate) and that they'd order just the cheese ones again next time. For dessert, my one friend and I had the churros, which were good, but we should have shared them since they came six to an order and were bigger than the waiter said they would be. They came with three dipping sauces: chocolate, caramel and raspberry, which were all very good, but I liked the raspberry the best. The churros were good, but were fried and were a little more greasy and crunchy than I thought they would be. My other friend ordered the ice cream sundae, which came with a really tasty caramel flavored ice cream.

Great atmosphere and service (our waitress, Jaimie, was all smiles the whole night) - if you have to wait for a table, they will text you once the table is ready (so you can either grab drinks while you wait inside the restaurant or take a nice walk outside with no worries). For drinks, I got myself a red Sangria that was really fruity, really sweet (maybe a little too sweet?) - I would've been happier if there was more of a kick to it.  Their Pinot Noir was grand with a rich smell and a nice, clean taste.  We got ourselves the guacamole - they said table-side preparation, but perhaps since we were seated all the way inside and there was not enough room for them to push the cart to us, the guac was prepared a few tables away without us knowing (I only later found out they prepared it a few tables away from us when I saw them making fresh guac for another table).  The guacamole was creamy and had just the right amount of onions, lime, and everything else nice.We also got plantains and flautas - the waitress was kind enough to tell us that these came with a cream and cheese topping - I feel like this never happens in other restaurants (because hey, who doesn't like to be surprised by cheese on all their foods?).  The waitress Jaimie was also nice enough to mention that their flautas are made a little spicier - thanks for your concern Jamie!

After a lot of help from my therapist, i feel ready to talk about it. I was so excited and I brought an ice cream cake with me to eat after my meal. I asked that they keep it in the refrigerator for me. The service was normal and nothing to write home about, and the food was quite boring. Here's where the trauma comes in. My cake, which I thought was waiting for me in a refrigerator was kept in the coat check closet. It was a melted mess and it was the first time I had an ice cream cake. They added cookies to it from the kitchen, but I cant eat wheat, so i couldn't eat them. They also offered me some free drinks to make up for it, but overall it was an underwhelming experience topped off with my sad, dying cake.",1,1,0,Brian B.,"North Charleston, SC",7,32,3

The prawns were overcooked, and I only got four of them on my plate. Also my dish on the menu said it had 'scallops', but there were none on my plate.

5.0,1/12/2015,"I've been to all of the Rosa Mexicano's in the city, and this is by far my preferred location.  It's more casual, less touristy, but still retains that neon-blue, Miami beach flair.A double date was planned for dinner on a Saturday evening around 7pm.  The better half was running a little late, so J & I grabbed a few drinks at the bar while we waited.  The restaurant is divided into three main rooms.  The first, the bar/lounge area, is located on the left-hand side of the restaurant.  There are plenty of seats at the bar, with more seats along with the room divider.  The room divider is a conversation piece; it features figurines diving off a wall with trickling water.  This area would be great for a first date or a quick drink at happy hour.For drinks, I ordered the Rosalita ""Skinny"" Margarita ($13), in the interest of saving a few calories. Mistake.  I admit that the Margarita was not that great, a little bitter for my taste buds.  I ended up ordering Mojitos for the rest of the evening.As for food, we [obviously] ordered the freshly prepared avocados for 4 people (two avocados), with a ""medium"" level of spice .  The medium level of spice here is equivalent to ""NADA spice,"" so for those who fear the spice, don't fear kicking up the spice level up another notch.  The guacomole comes with a basket of chips and some dipping sauces.  I love watching fresh guac being prepared table-side.For my entree, I ordered the the Salmon Poblano.  It's one of the healthiest items on the menu, in my opinion.  It's grilled salmon, about 6oz, served over sauteed kale, swimming in a green, poblano cream sauce. If you're looking for Mexican soul food, this dish is not the way to go.  But if you're looking for healthy food with a Mexican influence, I would recommend this dish.Service was great.  Our waiter let our table talk and catch up, without dipping into our conversation every 10 minutes to ask how things were going.  He didn't seem annoyed when we pondered over the dessert menu for 10 minutes, only to conclude that we were fatties and shouldn't eat any more.As for a characterization of the other diners I saw, I saw families with their children, girls doing their ""ladies night out,"" other couples and friends who simply wanted to enjoy a delicious dinner at a chic restaurant.  Rosa Mexicano doesn't scream ""New York"" to me, so if you're from out of town, there are a lot of New York famous restaurants you may want to consider for dinner, but I would recommend Rosa Mexicano for those who live in the area and would like to enjoy some great food in a great atmosphere.",4,0,0,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",253,403,259

5.0,1/4/2015,"Two of my best dinners in recent memory were had at Rosa Mexicano. First of all, as of January 2015, this is the best guacamole I've eaten in New York. Upon placing an order, it is promptly prepared table-side with a traditional mortar and pestle, adjusted according to your preferences. Seriously, this guac is incredible. The vegetable taco option rotates seasonally and can always be prepared vegan if the cheese is left off.My first visit, I enjoyed an amazing roasted vegetable medley with squash, portobello, and brussels sprouts. The platter arrived accompanied by the traditional fix-ins: black beans, rice, warm corn tortillas, and several salsas, which the entire table shared. The portions are generous, especially taking the sides into consideration, but perfect for one person with an eager appetite. Sharing is not necessary and you won't want to. I left the restaurant content and full, lamenting nothing about the experience apart from the slightly high price point, although it is absolutely worth every penny.Much to my unexpected excitement, I returned a few weeks later for more guacamole-induced happiness. The vegetarian taco now features roasted cauliflower, sautéed squash, chayote, and mushrooms. Somehow, my second dinner at Rosa Mexicano was even better than the first, which makes me wonder if I have grossly underestimated just how good life can be. This time around, I ordered a delicious frozen mango margarita, too.Service is consistent for such a high-volume restaurant. Needless to say, I would eat here every week if I could afford it.

3.0,12/18/2014,"I had high expectations for this place due to raving reviews about their guacamole and the fact that they are always packed. My boyfriend and I spontaneously decided to come here on a Wednesday night. I tried making a reservation like 2 hours prior, but had no luck, so we decided to just walk in anyway. I arrived around 7:30pm and was told we won't be seated until 8:30pm or later.By 8:45pm, we still weren't seated, and just settled for one of the high tables with a comfy couch at the bar. The bar area is self seating and first come, first serve. Our bar server was spectacular and very accommodating. We sat at a tiny table at first just to order some drinks and nachos, and once a bigger table opened up, she happily moved us over. On to the food/drinks... I tried the frozen pomegranate margarita, and my bf had the chile mango margarita. I preferred the mango one; it was creamier and more flavorful in my opinion. The nachos were just okay... We only ordered them because we were starving. We didn't order the guacamole yet at first because we had hoped to get seated at the dining room side, where we can watch the guacamole be made next to our table. Since we gave up on waiting, we ended up ordering the guac at the bar table anyway. Sadly, they couldn't make it next to our table...Along with the guacamole, we also ordered the shrimp ceviche, fish tacos, and the filet mignon with mushroom sauce. Guacamole aside, everything else was just less than mediocre. The entrees took forever to come out. The fish tacos were extremely bland, and it was cold by the time it made it to our table! The filet mignon did NOT look like filet mignon. It's normally a very thick cut, but it was only like half the thickness. There was no seasoning. The sauce was flavorless and cold. You can taste the mushroom, but there's like no salt and pepper whatsoever.Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed. When the server came back and asked how our food was, we complained about the lack of seasoning for our entrees. She said people usually love the filet mignon, but she did think that the sauce looked a little off. She said she'll see what she can do, and she ended up bringing us a dessert on the house. Very sweet of her but at this point, I didn't care for the dessert. It was already 10:30pm and I just wanted to get out of here.5 stars for our server. 4 stars for the guacamole. 1 star for everything else.Would I come back? For the guacamole, maybe.

The pork empanadas were perfectly prepared with a delicious sauce to go with it. The mahi was very fresh and tasty. As for the main course, we had a salmon poblano dish over kale, chorizo, roasted corn and a poblano sauce. It was a bit rare for my normal eating but it was very good nonetheless. We also had beef enchiladas which were very good as well. We got a pitcher of red sangria (among many margaritas) and it was incredibly sweet.

One cheese quesadilla and one order of guacamole was enough for the four of us to share as a snack, and they were both delicious! The quesadilla also came with rice and beans on the side, and a little scoop of guac which was a nice touch. I also ordered the pineapple mojito which I really enjoyed. The reason why this gets four stars is because the waiter was pretty rude. When I asked for the pineapple mojito (made with rum) he interrupted me and told me that this other, more expensive mojito (made with tequila) was ""1000 times better"" and he really tried to persuade me to get it. Um, I never asked for his opinion and he was pretty pushy. I told him I don't like tequila and the one I ordered turned out great anyway.

The waitress acted like she didn't know what i was talking about. I pointed to the other table next to me and said that one - it was literally that close. She then preceded to reluctantly answer my questions about the food. I figured I was being picky and marked it as a one off. Service in the DC one I went was reluctant as well....Went back the next day for Happy hour with a group of folk who didn't know each other and another waitress demanded that we all (all 25 of us) go on the same bill even though we were all at separate tables. Instead of coming up with a solution to help us out, as I know now to expect from this place, she walked away. So we decided to happily order a la cart at the bar and tip her nothing (instead of leaving - which with her attitude we should have done).

A pitcher of their sangria goes a long way (about 10 glasses). For the entrees I strongly recommended the alambre de camarones- it is grilled shrimp, on top of brown cilantro rice with a delicious mouth watering sauce made with tomatoes, onions and Serrano chiles.

Usually they serve it in individual shakers, but instead, it came poured, and was sludgy.  Where is that crisp tart tangy refreshing treat we had longed for?  The biggest disappointment on the menu was the Chili Rellenos, which were supposed to be filled with goat cheese.  They were filled with rice, and (maybe) a teaspoon of cheese.    The restaurant has been so successful, and has expanded to so many new locations, I think it has lost focus on providing truly exquisite cuisine.  Sometimes a restaurant gets too trendy for its own good.",0,0,1,Bernice R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,53,7

With a red and green sauce and the eggs topped with crunchy tortillas...yum. Unfortunately, the other dishes aren't that great....from the tostadas to the chicken tacos to the Mexican scrambled eggs...the food is quite ordinary tasting.

4.0,9/8/2014,"Yum. Just came here for using a  GILT promotion. We had been at the UES location many years ago, and to be  honest, I remember it was good but not this great. The promotion included and order of table side guacamole, Mahi Maui tacos for apetizer, and a choice of four different tacos trios per person. To drink a choice of a flight of tequila ( options include 2 añejos, 1 reposado and one Blanco ) or a margarita.  Lets start with the guac- the portion was generous and came with both warm soft tortillas and fried tortilla chips. We ordered ours spicy but it was definitely in the medium range ( not bad since that's my limit) the waiter was right when I asked exactly how spicy it was. The next items, the mahi mahi tacos were insanely good. They come sort of ceviche style and then drizzled with truffle oil. I die for anything with truffle oil and now I feel like I discovered something brand new to add it to. These guys are small but pack a flavor punch!Next we each got the cochinita pibil pork tacos and the shrimp Al pastor tacos. The shrimp tacos were good, nothing to write home about but it could be because the mahi mahi tacos just took us to a different level, and these guys didn't quite stand up to them. The cochinita pibil ones were amazing. They were incrediblely rich and smoky. Just the right amount of tender pork.The meal ended with fried churros and 3 dips: caramel, raspberry (yum!) And chocolate . The chocolate was great, I wonder if it's an import from Mexico, not your good ole Hersheys. I loved the citrus from the raspberry in contrast to the fried sugary dough. The tequilas were great and we discovered a new favorite for the house.Service was also great. The guys were checking in on us every step and our waiter Pete explained all of the options perfectly.

The guacamole here is simply fantastic. I LOVE it. The presentation is also on point. Look at that bad ass stone bowl and wooden spoon? If I had no shame, I would just eat it directly off the spoon because...well...duh.For our second round, I got a regular Frozen Margarita and Melissa got another Pineapple Mojito.

3.0,8/1/2014,"I had gone to RM several years ago, and had a disastrous experience. So the decision to come back was part of last minute plans, and my giving this place another shot. Sort of like the ridiculous death defying rollercoaster, best not to mull the decision, just strap in and go for the ride. I managed  to grabbed a reservation for 6:15pm within the hour and was seated immediately on arrival. Forgot it was restaurant week, and though it looked good (you can pick any three things off the menu, and guac is made for 2 so it counts as a choice for both. Got it? It means you can get guac and two margaritas for dinner. That's kind of awesome). Decided just to go with some sides and sangria. You will have your dedicated waiter, but bussers will clear your area as they pass by and as needed. Tables are spaced out enough for 'privacy'. Clean, upscale and everything presented well. However it was incredibly noisy and with the size of the tables, when it is at capacity, it has a cafeteria level. You will not be able to hear the person across from you. Elegance goes out the window.Though the food is good (the peppers in the quesadillas crunched slightly with fresh flavor), the prices remind me why I learned to make the same dishes, and any romantic facade is undone by noise.Good for dates? NO. Good for a group of four friends? Sure, but the bill will reflect upscale, while the sound level will remind you of the lunchroom where you first met.",1,1,0,Peter D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",125,270,4

4.0,7/24/2014,"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Friday evening.  It was pretty crowded that night so the hostess insisted that our entire party arrive before we can be seated.  To her credit, she accommodated changes to the number of people we had like 3 times.  The interior is pretty neat -there's a wall with blue lights covered with cliff diver figures.  The place is spacious, with a main dining area in the front and another more separated one in the back.  As soon as we were seated someone asked if we wanted their famous Guacamole en Molcajete, which we of course said yes.  Sure enough, within minutes a staff member rolled out a cart and handmade guacamole in front of us inside a giant stone bowl.  We got two of them, one spicy and one mild, and both were delicious.  The chips and guac themselves could've filled us up and I was almost tempted to just cancel my order.  The drinks were also very good, and of course I got the famous Pomegranate Margarita.  The drink was strong and a bit too sweet, which kind of masked any hints of pomegranate, but it was still good nonetheless.  Based on fellow Yelpers' reviews I got the Baja Tacos, which were made with local white fish and served with jalapeno tartar sauce.  However, I think they were a bit overrated.  The white fish wasn't too flavorful, the tartar sauce didn't have a kick, and the tortilla was a bit dry and bland.  I may have been full off of the guac already, but I didn't finish my fish tacos.  The grilled Mexican street corn, in fact, was my favorite part of that dish as it was sweet, juicy, and piping hot.  I'd probably try a different dish next time.  The birthday celebration itself was great, and the server worked with us to select several dessert dishes to bring out with candles.  The best part of it was they came out with a giant box, a sombrero for the birthday girl, and even a special birthday shot of tequila.  The final bill?  Birthday-sized.  But the ambience was great, and the guac and drinks were great.  Would consider coming back for  HH or something in the future.  Solid Mexican spot.",1,0,0,Richard M.,"Queens, NY",30,165,93

Guac was yummy and fresh (they make in front of you).A waiter served us the next 2 dishes and we were left alone until we were finished eating. Funny thing is, we were done eating after 10 minutes bc the short ribs were tough and dry (at least there was plenty of sauce to dip it in which was tasty) and the shrimp with lime was frozen lime smothered in lime juice...pretty gross.The same server collected our dishes that had literally 75% of the food uneaten, and never bothered to ask how we liked our meal.  This makes complete sense given they most likely know the answer they're going to get.Having lived in NYC for 4 years, this was by far the WORST meal we've had here.",0,0,0,Danielle P.,"Windham, NH",0,17,0

I need a chain restaurant, close by, with decent prices. This place covered all that. The ambiance of the place is really cool. It has some Americanized Mexican flare but also some modern vibes going on. We got there almost an hour after our reservation time but the lady there was very sweet about it. We got seated in a booth (yay) and the guacamole was recommended to us. They also mentioned the sangria.  What the hell....we got both! And it was a super delicious good choice. The guac was SOOO GOOD. It's probably up there in terms of best tasting restaurant guacamole. We got the bigger size thinking we wouldn't finish it. GURL it was gone before you could say pika pika. The sangria was also consumed fairly quickly. When our entrees came around everyone was pleased. My fish tacos were crunchy and worth eating. Nobody was blown away but I was happy with my meal.

2.0,6/27/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday and the experience here was just very sub-par.1. The only redeeming qualities of this restaurant is the decor itself- it's very pretty inside and has a nice modern feel to it. (1 star)2. There were about 13 of us crammed together on a round table, which was uncomfortable at times because we were sitting so closely together that our plates had to overlap (due to lack of space)3. Service was good, no complaints there. (1 star)4. We all decided to get the guac since everybody else on Yelp was raving about it, but honestly, I didn't understand why it was so expensive (almost $20 for a portion for 2-3 people!!!). It didn't even taste exceptional, and I'm pretty sure I make waaaayy better guac5. My main course was very disappointing. For $17, I got 3 fish tacos (yes, 3), each of which had a small strip of fried fish. The fish itself was very bland and barely had any flavor, so it didn't even compensate for its high price. My boyfriend got the chicken taco, which wasn't even a taco. It was just a plate of sliced grilled chicken and peppers. This was $20, when he easily could've gotten a way better version at Chipotle. We also got rice and beans on the side, which honestly looked like cafeteria food.Overall, this place made me suffer from buyer's remorse.

Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but seriously?The guacamole guy gave us two sauces, when we asked for another green sauce he claimed that he put a double in the little dish and wouldn't give us another one.  I hate to break it to you but how are people on the other end of the table suppose to reach the one sauce you left on this side of the table?  All of us being spice lovers, finished off that green sauce in ten seconds, only to have the waiter get us some more.

Baja tacos were tasty, thin crisp outside and meaty flaky white fish inside. Carne asada was moist and tender, shrimp tacos were tasty and pineapple salsa was a fresh take on the shrimp tacos. Drinks were refreshing and didn't taste strong but don't be fooled, it's pretty buzz worthy.

Uncle Moe's was a divey kind of place, but the food was fantastic.  We live in the neighborhood and work here, too, so once Uncle Moe's closed, we decided to give Rosa a try, and we are very happy we did.  We've tried many dishes, but my favorite is their chicken enchiladas and I love their guacamole....my wife loves their food too, along with an iced cold Margarita, and she is in 7th heaven :)",0,0,0,John C.,"New York, NY",126,40,4

Food-wise, nothing is bad here, however nothing is great either that I have tried. It's a very American tasting mexican place. Also, no pork? what kind of mexican place doesn't have pork? Even thought the food isn't great, the wait staff is top notch, it's also very clean and wonderfully decorated inside. Big tables, high ceiling, wonderful lighting and no rushing you out the door make it a pretty sweet hangout space. Unfortunately when it comes down to it, the food just doesn't deliver.

The ambiance is modern and this place is so spacious!We ordered the guacamole for the table - one spicy and the other mild. The guacamole comes with soft corn tortillas and chips, and also a red and green sauce. The red sauce is a chipotle sauce and really delicious! I even asked for more to have with my entree.The drinks are by far my favorite thing here. They make skinny margaritas, flavored mojitos and sangria among other things. I ordered the skinny margarita - which was really good. My boyfriend ordered La Unica, which is reposado tequila, grand marnier, lime and agave. This drink was a little strong for my taste, but still cool and refreshing.For the main course, I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas (they basically substituted the cheese with various chopped veggies) and it came with a red tomato sauce. Personally the sauce wasn't my favorite - it taste like tomato puree. The dish comes with rice and beans (which they made vegan for me). I did end up using the before mention red red sauce to give the dish a little more flavor. My boyfriend ordered the chicken enchiladas which he really liked.

Anyways our server was very kind and attentive and the food and drinks were excellent but the guac could have used a little more salt and lime. I had the braised short ribs and from that point on I couldn't stop thinking about the short ribs. Finally we returned in December to have another try of the short ribs and this time I had reservations.... our server was again friendly and attentive but I left with a stomachache not sure if it was from the food or not but the short ribs was not what I remembered it was like and I barely ate it and ended up taking it home where it died in the refrigerator. I again during restaurant week and the service was good the food was just ok for me. Mexican food is one of my favorite foods and I think I have been to many mexican restaurants so while i want to love the food here it just doesn't do it for me.

The guacamole was so fresh but like other reviews it need some more ingredients that would make it awesome I got the Carne Asada. Great dish. Sort of small-sized portion but it was pretty delicious. The cheese at the bottom of the skillet was a bad surprise since u had to scrap it off. I had fun putting the meat into little tortilla wraps. I love food that are hands on such this dish.My friend got the duck tacos which she said was very good moist and lots of duck filling. Only two things that stopped me from giving this place 5 stars. One would of been the service, it was not my first time here usually the waiters are very attentive but that night our waiter was juggling us a few other tables and a huge party.

Rosa Mexicano (shouldn't it be Rosa Mexicana?) has stylish settings and stylish food that also happens to be fresh and tasty.One reviewer here has indicated that the staff was ""extremely friendly"" and I'd say that that's true.

Please, servers, it's okay to be a bit more natural. Then again, this is NYC and moderation isn't so much our forte...Rosa Mexicano is stylish, delicious, and fresh. It's also a block or two from Union Square and thus a good place to meet friends. That means that you pay for it with higher prices.

After discovering Rosa on a work trip to NYC a few years ago, it's a tradition that we spend one night there drinking their great margaritas and eating boatloads of fresh, table-side prepared guacamole.My favorite dish is the carne asada ""skillet style."" It's plentiful, hot, cheesy and seasoned to perfection. They've got a margarita that has some kind of orange hint to it (can't remember the name) and it's excellent (and comes in a tall glass aka lots of it).With tons of seating for all numbers, and a very sexy decor, this is a great spot to take friends and make a night of it. They've also got a sweet waterfall in the main dining room that will have you in awe. I haven't been to any of their other locations but would expect them to be as classy and service friendly as this one. Well done Rosa.",0,1,0,Blake L.,"Carmel, IN",73,91,52
4.0,2/4/2014,"Rosa Mexicano is your typical upscale Mexican restaurant where the food is [almost] authentic, always consistent, and you get a great meal.  This location is huge, and for a random Wednesday evening, it was rather busy, which is always a good sign.On a dinner date with my mom, we skipped appetizers (though I hear the table side guacamole is great) and went straight for the entrees.  I ordered the Salmón en Manchamanteles (salmon with tropical fruit mole) which was a generous portion of fish, with great mole sauce, and had a nice kick from the fruit.  My mom got the Baja Fish Tacos, and though she rarely finishes everything on her plate, ate every last bite.The best part of my experience here took me by surprise.  I was feeling unfulfilled (probably from the lack of appetizer) and decided to treat myself to dessert.  I got the Blackberry Tres Leches cake and WOW, hit the spot.I do plan on coming back and when I do, I WILL have an appetizer AND a drink.",2,0,0,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",1004,802,3287
3.0,2/4/2014,"Rosa Mexicano was a solid choice for a dinner after a few hours spent wandering the halls of the Met. okay, I also had a gift certificate which paid for our dinner, which came in handy.first off, I think a 3.5 is more accurate, but I think a return trip might swing this to a more solid 4.the decor was upscale, almost loungey. the waterfall was a sweet addition. as some other reviewers commented, it does kinda remind me of a restaurant you'd find in Vegas.we ordered guac and chips to start with. freshly made to order, it was a solid choice, a good placeholder in our bellies. also, in retrospect, I should have asked for spicier. also, for 12 bucks, I felt there could have been a bit more guac (on the other hand, it was fresh).my ""mezcalito"" drink was POTENT and worth the price of admission (I want to say it was around $12). while mezcal on its own isn't my thing, this time it was mixed with jalapeno-infused tequila. kudos to the bartender.as for entree, I chose the crispy pork shank, which came with 2 of the 3 side dish options (chili and creamed spinach). so, I ordered the third one for the hat trick - fried plantains with queso fresco. the pork shank was excellent - a little crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside, and gigantic to boot. the chili and spinach were alright, not bad but not impressive. the plantains were the knockout option, DEFINITELY get those. the rice and beans weren't anything special.as for dessert, the espresso flan on top of an ancho chile infused brownie called to me. the brownie was kinda small, and I didn't taste any chile...but the flan was excellent - great consistency and flavor. and to wash it down, a glass of port. because, why not?some of the menu items are a bit pricey - the pork shank was almost 30 bucks, though to be fair the portion size was outstanding. I guess you have to pick and choose - we were more liberal with our spending (for once) due to our gift certificate.service was great and very attentive. it was pretty packed on Saturday - thankfully, they take OpenTable so we didn't have to worry. mixed crowd - all sorts of people.would be interested in returning to check it out again.

4.0,2/2/2014,"I was saving my 500th review for something special, so I was sort of glad when I realized I had never reviewed Rosa's!My boyfriend and I went on our first date here, and our one year anniversary as well. While we don't necessarily plan to make an annual tradition out of it... Rosa's was a perfect place to meet the man that I'm (hopefully) going to be spending the rest of my life with :-)I've been to the other locations, and this one is definitely the best. Everything I've ordered off the menu has been superb, with the enchiladas and the braised pork shank at the top. The pork shank is a bit pricier than the other items, but it is HUGE in comparison and I've always had tons left over. The table side guacamole is really good as well, but I wish they had an option for a smaller portion. I think the pitcher of sangria is the best bang for your buck, it's sweet, but surprisingly pretty strong. I always feel like I need just one more glass though.This location of Rosa's is very spacious but pretty much always packed... For some reason I always get stuck at the ridiculous high two-top tables and I feel like I need a booster seat!They change their menu fairly often, so some items will disappear. This is unfortunate because my boyfriends favorite shrimp and steak skillet is no longer on the menu. I wonder how they decide which items to phase out. Rosa's is a great spot for the Union Square area whether a date night or larger get together.

5.0,1/11/2014,"Delicious food, great service, beautiful space! My husband and I came here for a casual birthday dinner (as in, not going all out to someplace with a 10 course tasting menu, but something nice and festive), and we were not disappointed. The space is large and cavernous, beautifully lit and the tables are comfortably disposed. After a few days of eating at tiny places with tiny tables, the spaciousness of Rosa Mexican was welcome. Our server was friendly, helpful with suggestions and wonderfully accommodating. We got the tableside guacamole, which was genuinely spicy as ordered. The chips came with two sides of salsa, and the green one was the favorite - also very spicy and flavorful. My husband got the fish tacos, which were fried and wonderful, and came with two little funny sides of corn salad and chorizo chili, while I ordered a special that came with a tequila-lime marinated skirt steak, a cheese enchilada, and some wonderful peppers and onions held together with a cream sauce. The steak was amazing, as were the peppers and onions. The only thing that didn't wow was the enchilada, as it was a bit tough or rubbery. I liked the enchilada sauce it came in, though. Our dinners also came with a bowl of rice and a bowl of refried black beans. The rice was unspectacular, but I've never had rice at a Mexican place that wasn't, but the beans were heavenly - creamy and flavorful.  Our server brought us an additional basket of chips with which to eat said beans - delicious.

3.0,1/3/2014,"3.5 stars.  Full review at stepyeats.comWhen it comes to chains, I usually say no.  Some of them catch me off guard though.  Rosa Mexicano (which I prefer to Dos Caminos) is always a delight.  They make mean margaritas (the ultimate party drink), and they have pretty yummy guacamole (when they make in front of you when you order!).  So, naturally, with guac and tequila rimmed-salted glasses, I thought Rosa's Union Square locations would be ideal for a New Year's Eve gathering with 11 other good friends of mine.For NYE, Rosa's will adorn you with silly party gear (like hats and streamers) but no champagne toast (ugh) but the bad things to say end there.  Well... strike that.  The service was way too too fast and a little abrupt but hey kudos to being able to seat a party of 12 with ease for NYE.  The menu: there's prix fixe available for NYE goers for $55 and offers:1) Table guac - yummy, traditional, mild but always chunky. Made with equal parts of avocado and tomato. Major con- they only gave two regular sized bowls for 12 people; way, way too little. I got maybe two small scoops of guac. Shucks, it's the best part!2) Appetizers- there was an array of different bites but I for sure got the best: the hamachi tacos. That might be the best thing there.  Small, mini bites of delicious hard taco cheese encasing juicy pieces of yellowtail doused in just the right mayo aioli--not too thick; I guess it's sort of like the sushi mayo you typically get.   Others had mini tacos, and ceviches.3) Mains - again, usual suspects like skirt steak (was a huge, juicy looking portion), crusted red snapper (this was downsized I think), steal/chicken fajitas, chicken enchiladas, and what I got- the only vegetarian dish (but a traditional one).  The poblano wad scorched a little too thin but the filling was interesting and skewed sweet- pine nuts, raisins, and goat cheese (yum). While portions looked small, everyone was pretty full.4) Perhaps the BEST item of the night. Desert for all- chorus, the Mexican doughnut.  Gooey, fluffy, sugar-y Mexicano classic sweets that came with the best cherry sauce, dulce de leche and chocolate.  The churros were so rich and filling though that I was surprised I ate two small pieces.",2,2,1,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

Unfortunately, not due to a positive experience. The locale itself is beautiful .High ceilings, large open eating area, everything you would expect from a high end New York restaurant. We ordered some usual dishes guacamole and chips as an appetizer, then chicken as the main dish. The food that was served, was at minimum sub- par, but honestly, it wasn't edible. The main dish arrived in some creamy white sauce, that i had never before seen in a Mexican restaurant. The portions were too big, and unappealing.

2.0,11/5/2013,"I feel like an a*hole snob declaring I'm from California and judging Mexican food in NYC for what it really is - but I came here to warn you guys, this place is really pretty bad. Not sure how it's so popular but can get so many things wrong:DRINKS- pomegranate margarita - pretty strong but did not taste at all like pomegranate. - coconut mojito - this was actually pretty good. I liked the coconut flavor.APPS- crab turnovers - didn't really taste like crab. Could only identify fish-y filler paste, no ""jumbo lump crab"" as advertised. Served lukewarm.- guacamole - huge rip-off!!! $26 for a double order (which is a good size bowl but isn't all that big. We got 2 of these for a total of $52 for a party of 7... wait what?! We paid $52 for guacamole??). The worst part is that there was no seasoning in the guacamole at all. Not a hint of salt, barely any lime and not t tiny bit spicy as ordered. It's cool that you use fresh avocados and make it tableside to make it seem even fresher, but please learn to season your food.- chips didn't taste particularly fresh. Would have been nice if they were served warm.MAIN DISH- crispy pork shank - this was tender and cooked well but had very little flavor. Again, barely any seasoning or spice. Same for the bland beans on the side. DESSERT- hot mexican donuts - These were basic churros. And they weren't hot or soft or delicious. - espresso flan - this had a weird consistency and sour flavor. The bottom 'brownie' portion wasn't very brownie-like, just kind of hard and not very sweet or satisfying. - tres leches cake - this was actually really good and the highlight of the meal.SERVICE- the waiter was pretty nice but also forgot to bring a couple of dishes out (the ceviche and the tres leches, although the latter we re-asked about). And the waitstaff just came by and grabbed random dishes before we were finished without asking (the chips and random sauces which could be applied to other food).Look, the place is pretty nice-looking and was packed and I get the idea of overpriced, err sorry I mean upscale Mexican food, but please reevaluate your dish flavors and learn to season your food.

3.0,10/26/2013,"Okay, their guacamole was pretty good.   Truly, it was.  However, I didn't have much of that, only a few bites, so my review constitutes the food that I did order.I had the pollo lunch - grilled chicken with sauteed peppers, onions, Chihuahua cheese, Mexican street corn and beans.    It looked pretty delicious, but then I went to eat a bite.  Blegh - the chicken was chewy and bland, and to be quite honest, it didn't taste cooked at all.  I wanted to spit it up into my napkin.  There were a few high quality peppers and onions, and the greasy cheese was all at the bottom.  I thought that the chili beans weren't very good, nor was the Mexican street corn, which was sort of like creamed corn.My coworker ordered a salad which looked fantastic, so if my office orders this again, I would probably order that - it was the cobb salad.   However, what gives them three stars in this review is mainly their killer guacamole.",1,0,0,kelly r.,"Glendale, NY",9,251,0

I was on meds and didn't order a drink (obviously) so I couldn't tell you about the drinks (next time!) but they looked big and delicious from what I could see.  We had a 9 pm reservation and were seated immediately.  Tip - make a reservation especially on the weekends, this place gets packed.Overall Rosa Mexicano gets 5 stars.  Fun restaurant.

4.0,10/6/2013,"I love me some Rosa Mexicano. Girlllllll.......First of all, I got suckered into this place on the date. Sufficed to say, I'm not seeing said date, but I still come here. Hot damn. That's just a measure of how good it is.The happy hour is pretty solid. While I could gripe that they've changed said happy hour a DOZEN times over the last year (basically they stripped away all the really really good deals like  removing certain tapas/appetizers off the menu), but I will try to hold back...for now. The bartenders are really sweet, fast, and good at what they do. I highly recommend it for a quick bite on weekdays (4-7pm) and weekends (Sat or Sun, 4-7pm.) Never Friday, though! That's a rookie mistake.As for the main dining, I've been here a total of 5 times. I like it. I mean, their famous for their guacamole which is solid. It's good stuff. Their menu still needs some UMPH, but overall the choices are great. The place is pricey though, but with the ambiance, great service, and taste of food if I close my eyes when handing over my card with the check I can live through it. I just wish for the price the portions were bigger (that's my second almost gripe).Overall, I'm a fan. I can live through it.

4.0,9/30/2013,"Overview:Went for dinner to RM with a friend following a drink at nearby bar. Impressive restaurant visually, has a Houston/Vegas style to it with the huge ceilings and large floor space, yet somehow still maintains an element of intimacy with the booth tables. Certainly has elements of typical Mexican restaurant, but doe succeed in coming across as higher end.Food:We shared spicy taco starter, very tasty pile of crunchy and spicy stuff - points for taste, but looked a bit chaotic (though to me Mexican cuisine isn't about how it looks). Also ordered the pulled duck, though they had to substitute for chicken as out of duck - not a problem as equally delicious, incredible creamy yellow sauce this came in. We ended up scraping the plate for the last remnants...Main courses were beef enchiladas and salmon mole. Both perfectly tasty, but after the started were hard to top. Enciladas came in a thick dark sauce that was more like a mole, the salmon was lightly cooked and in a spicy tomato base sauce that gave a good combination though wouldn't necessarily chose that again. The waiter did forget our plantane side, but we couldn't have eaten it anyway as so full - he was very apologetic.Drinks:Couple of tequilas - went for the traditional standard - were on the small side, though good quality and clearly made by a mixologist, not just thrown together a la cheesecake factory. We later had a couple of the white wines (Sauv., Reis.), both perfectly acceptable for long drinking after a large meal.Close off:My friend and I ended up chatting late into the night and decided to stay for a glass of wine or two rather than risk the late night Sunday bar scene. Staff were more than happy for us to stay until they switched off the lights. For two starters, two main courses and two tequilas, the cheque rolled in at $99 - pleased with that as both of us were full of food that we had enjoyed.Bottom line:I'm relatively new to mexican food, coming from the UK, but this certainly is certainly 'up scale' from the take away dross that frequents seamless. Not a bad date location, but certainly a great spot to take a few friends. Could imagine some rowdy nights/brunches here with a big group, but also a good spot with work colleagues.",0,0,0,Simon W.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

After an hour of no food or even guacamole and after having to track down a server to bring me chips bc I was so hungry  (which should have been a thing they would automatically give if they are backed up and people are waiting longer then usual) but the final straw was watching people who had gotten there way after me get guacamole before me.  Sorry but you guys need to work on your service and pay better attention to your guests.

Went with the ice cream guacamole, which was a nice touch with the frozen molcajete, unfortunately the ice cream emerged slightly too cold so it consequently  never thawed out. I admit I thoroughly enjoyed this, as well as the side sauces with cinnamon crisps (I was surprisingly too full for ice cream stuffed churros since they did offer a nice # of scoops of avocado ice cream). Friendly service all around (and at neighboring tables) in the touristy atmosphere, though table-side prep was awkward since they used the same flaccid spatula they use for the normal guacamole - while the tool wasn't quite up to the task with the aforementioned frozen mass, my server pulled it off.  The ice cream fest is dine-in only, but fortunately the ice cream fest coincided with RW so I was able to get a $5 statement credit to offset the $16.50 total.",0,0,0,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304

5.0,8/27/2013,"I went to Rosa Mexicano with friends.  It was a wonderful experience.  The waterfall and palm trees made it feel like you were in Cancun, Mexico.  For starters (entradas), we had the Guacamole en Molcajete and Tacos de Pescado.  The Guacamole en Molcajete was served with fresh guacamole with a dish of warm corn tortillas and crispy tortilla chips along with pasilla de Oaxaca and tomatillo-habanero salsas.  The guacamole was mild spicy while the salsas were spicy.  I like to put the pasilla del Oaxaca salsa and the guacamole on the crispy tortilla chips, especially since the salsa was made from cilantro.  The Tacos de Pescado was made with fried catfish and jalapeno tartar sauce on flour tortillas.  I really like the crunch on the radishes and the sauce complimented the fish.Next, we had the appetizers, which were the Ensalada del Mercado and the Queso Fundido.  The Ensalada del Mercado had mixed greens, avocado, radishes, tomatoes, carrots, red onions, and orange segments tossed in honey-lime vinaigrette.  I did not really like the salad because it was not a wow factor.  I mean the only thing I enjoy was the juicy orange segments.  In my opinion, the salad was bland.  The Queso Fundido was a joy to eat.  It was melted Chihuahua cheese with chorizo sausage and rajas.  We put a spoonful of Queso Fundido on a corn tortilla.  The cheese was sweet and the chorizo was definitely tasty.  The Queso Fundido and the corn tortilla together tasted like a pepperoni sliced pizza.Afterwards, we had entrees, which were the Enchiladas Suizas and Alambre a la Mexicana.  The Enchiladas Suizas was a soft corn tortillas filled with Chihuahua cheese and served in a creamy tomatillo sauce.  I do not know why the sauce was green, but it did not compliment the food well at all.  I took one bit, and I was done.  I regret taking a whole piece since I couldn't eat it anymore and no one else got to try it.    The Alambre a la Mexicana was pretty good.  It had grilled cubes of beef tenderloin, chorizo sausage, onions, tomatoes, and serrano peppers with tomatillo and tomato-chipotle sauces served over house rice.  I can't really tell you about the meat since I cannot eat beef, but I took some rice that was not touched by the beef and it was yummy.  I like the tomato-chipotle sauce, which is the red sauce on the side, with the rice.  I definitely did not like the tomatillo sauce, the green one, because it has a sour taste to it.  I was glad that they put the sauce on the side of the dish and not on the food, so you get to pick which one you want.  The entrees were served with two side dishes, which were the grilled corn and sauteed chipotle spinach.  Definitely like the grilled corn more because it was sweet and crunch.  The color on the corn side dish was more appealing than the dull green on the chipotle spinach.  Lastly, we had dessert (postre), which were Churros, Flan de Rosa, Tres Leches de Zarzamoras, and sprinkled cookies.  I couldn't have dessert because I was so full from eating, but my friends seemed to enjoy the Churros and the Flan de Rosa.  It was a nice ending to a wonderful meal.",2,0,0,Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,95,12

I'll spare you the details since I'm sure you've read enough about the guac by now.Since I wasn't too hungry, I decided to order an appetizer. The hamachi (yellowtail) hard shell tacos. It's supposed to come with bacon, which I didn't taste. I mostly only tasted the overdose of mayo (or whatever sauce that was) that it was drowned in. For the few bites of fish I was able to taste, it tasted like some of the pieces had been cooked - and the dish is supposed to be raw. It wasn't horrible but for $13.50 for three tacos the size of my thumb, I don't think it was worth it.The three stars really goes to the drink I had. Called La Jengilada, this concoction was made up of Rogue Juniper Ale, tequila, ginger and lemon. You can't taste the tequila but you can definitely feel it (which is my kind of drink!)

I did feel transported, but rather than the golden beaches of Mexico it was to the over-processed lands of Las Vegas. Flashy decor, cavernous spaces and minute attention to how everything looks rather than to how it tastes, even to the point where they have a decorative container of Agua Fresca at the entrance that you could not drink. That's right, they have decorative water welcoming you that you cannot drink. My companions and I went for the Lunch Crunch option - a bento box style lunch option created for those of us with limited time and a desire for a taste of everything from tacos to soup and even flan. Unfortunately, they fell short on flavor, composition and quality, but not as short as the ceviche sampler that was less than fresh and so not worth ordering. The service was weird. All I can say is that it was weird. The guy didn't seem to know the menu well, was sloppy during the ordering process, had very little communication with or understanding of what was happening in the kitchen and, when my companion inquired about swapping something - anything - for the flan he absolutely will not eat, he basically said the kitchen wouldn't do it and he had no other choice but to eat flan.

The waiter was very attentive and checked on us several times. For an appetizer we ordered the guacamole served with chips. It was a big portion and satisfied our table of 6.For my entree i ordered the mexican club sandwich with sweet potato fries. The fries were a hit, cripsy and sweet. The sandwich was average. The bread was crispy at first but harden as it got cold. Inside was ham, chicken, avocado, roasted jalapeno, bacon and refried beans. I do not recommend this sandwich though, it seemed like an average meal that can be eaten at a deli.For dessert we got their dessert guacamole. I recommend this, it is good for sharing and was a good eating experience. Similar to the appetizer guacamole, this sweetened version was a big portion. They mixed the avocado ice cream in the cold stone bowl and added strawberries, white chocolate and mint. As opposed to the salty chips served with the appetizer, they served cinnamon chips along with a chocolate sauce and rasberry sauce. Very yummy. Overall, it was a great first experience.

It's much more casual than the midtown place where I went some time ago where they had white tablecloths, quiet ambiance, and impeccable service back then.  This Union Sqr location is large, open, and vibrant.  And the service and food seemed to have gone down a notch - very spotty service (we had guac and sangria, then finished our guac & chips and waited and waited until I had to ask a busboy to call the waiter. But got our check as soon as our table is cleared.)Food were mostly mediocre. Guac was great but guy put too much salt - and I like salty food.  Pulled short ribs enchilada was unimpressive and was not edible the next day (terrible brown rice & beans). Scallop and pork belly tacos were good.  Ceviche sampler - NOT worth it.  Only the whitefish ceviche was very good, the other 2 were boring and seemed as if they only relied on the fact they were yellowtail and tuna.  Sangria?  Diluted and too fruity.  You can get much better, more flavorful sangria in other less expensive mexican and spanish restos in the area.  Total ""meh"" especially for the price.",0,0,0,Harue J.,"Manhattan, NY",14,272,32

For entree, I ordered Veg lunch platter and she did enchiladas. The platter was served in a beautifully portioned plate. It had soft taco, a dessert, and flavored (pink) yogurt. The portion was small. But it came with a rice bowl and beans. The taco was delicious. So was the chocolate cake dessert. The best part of the meal was enchiladas. It was sooooooo good I am glad she ordered that. I always love it and will come back for that again. It was served at ideal temperature and had perfect amount of lime it was yummy , we both loved it. Overall the food was amazing. And I had one of the best food around. I liked the place earlier, now I am devotee.",0,0,0,Raj Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1,8,1

4.0,7/24/2013,"Menu prices seem on the high end overall but the food was delicious. The service was spot on for the most part and the waiters were friendly. We had a couple of appetizers before out meal. The guacamole was very good, fresh with nice big chunks. The tuna ceviche was decent, the tuna didn't taste the freshest but overall it was a refreshing dish. The queso fundido tasted pretty good however it wasn't served that hot and firmed up fairly quickly to where it was almost inedible.I had the carne asada for my main. The steak was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.  I was already pretty stuffed but if I hadn't been the portion size wasn't the largest. Overall I really liked the dish, I would definitely get it the next time around. For dessert I had the Flan. I've never had espresso flavored flan nor have I had one with a brownie bottom so I was a little unsure after the first bite. I ended up destroying the thing, it was really delicious. I didn't really get a chili flavor from the brownie which was my only disappointment. I was told I had to get a pomegranate margarita which I did. I'm not sure what everyone raves about. It was good but nothing mind blowing and certainly nothing I haven't had before. I always end up drinking frozen margaritas too far and giving myself brain freeze. I'm not sure when I'll come back to Rosa Mexicano. It's a good meal but the price will keep me away.",1,0,1,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",151,749,53

After the hot chocolate was delivered she brought the baileys which at that point we didn't want anymore but we took which was fine. I didn't take it (lactose intolerant) but to make up for it she brought an additional sampler margarita which we thought was on the house but we were charged for. In total we paid $107 for brunch($56 for the gilt deal + $20 for the 2 baileys which seems high + $23 for tax and $5 for the drink we didn't ask for). The drinks also seemed watered down.

2.0,7/1/2013,"Rosa, I think we got off on the wrong foot. I must know: Why do you have the refreshing-looking Agua Fresca, complete with a spout for easy pouring, by the hostess stand? I walk through your doors during this blazing heat wave, and you seem to have gone to the trouble of artfully preparing this drink...to what end? To tease me? Why would you possibly set something up like that if it was not for consumption? In what world is it a good idea to convey to your customers, ""We went to the trouble of making this cold beverage to give the APPEARANCE of good hospitality, but you can't actually partake""?Agua Fresca issues aside, I was unimpressed by your offerings. Perhaps it was my own fault for [not drinking margaritas until things tasted good and for] ordering the ""Lunch Crunch"" Mexican bento box type things, but they fell a bit short. For $15, you get a taco, a soup, some guacamole and flan.* Sounds like a wonderful smorgasbord of Mexican delights! Unfortunately, nothing was particularly tasty. That includes the ceviche sampler that arrived after our entrees (our waiter actually said that ""They lost the key to the kitchen."" No idea what that even means). Although, the tuna wasn't bad. Next time I want to overpay for Mexican food at lunch, I'm going to Dos Caminos._______________*Don't try to switch anything out. I'm not big on dessert at lunch, nor am I big on flan.

1.0,5/25/2013,"Never do I write reviews on Yelp.  That's mostly because I'm usually only modestly disappointed with a good or service, if I'm disappointed at all.Then I ate at Rosa Mexicano tonight.  It was truly awful.To begin with, the hostess informed us that they expect the table to be ""turned around"" in 90 minutes.  Seems a bit rude at first, but lets be fair, there were many people waiting for tables when we arrived, while we were eating, and when we left.  Now we are seated and the wait staff is a bit pretentious and snooty, acting as if we are dining at The Four Seasons.First glance at the menu seems like regular Mexican food - tacos, enchiladas, rice and beans, etc.  The prices seem very high for this type of food so you guess that the quality will be accordingly superior.  Certainly not!!! The food has all the looks, tastes, and character of being prepped hours before and micro waved before serving i.e. cold, repulsively salty over seasoned, and obviously not fresh.  A bowl of rice and refried beans were put on the table for condiments.  Both were a cold salt bomb.  We were convinced to buy the guacamole made tableside for an outrageous $14.  We assented because this is what RM is famous for?  SALT BOMB!!  Are they using rock salt from the DOT?I had the fish tacos, which were comprised of three flour tortillas, filled with cod that was probably previously frozen and then deep fried in a batter that was at the same time gooey, greasy, and like cement.  The plate came with two small ramekins of each corn and black beans - both were cold and the beans were undercooked.  The corn was cooked with so much sugar - why?  Seventeen dollars for this?  I must concede that the presentation was beautiful.  They were arranged on a rectangular plate slanted at 120 degrees obtuse as if they used a protractor to get the angle right.  My dining companions had the enchiladas and ceviche respectively.  I won't comment on something I didn't try but they were disappointed.  I could ramble on for ever but TO SUM IT UP:1. Food is overpriced, pre-prepared, too salty, over spiced to mask the disappointing flavor of inferior ingredients, and served cold.2. Service is a bit pretentious; acting as if this is the Four Seasons and giving you attitude if you don't order drinks and their ""legendary"" guacamole.3. Rosa Mexicano is the stereotypical overhyped, Zagat loved media darling restaurant celebrity chef restaurateur restaurant. That is just the reality in twenty-first century New York.  Patrons are more concerned with being seen their in the Dolce and Gabbana outfits and living the dream of being upper class NYC professionals than the quality of the food.",0,0,0,Vee N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

4.0,5/15/2013,"***MAKING A CASE FOR HAPPY HOUR***The Lincoln Center location kind of rubbed me the wrong way when I went there last year, but perhaps it had something to do with the fact that I was two days unemployed (not through choice or planning) and was hanging out with my gay best friend who was about to move away to California and his well-heeled friend. It was prime dinnertime, too, so a bowl of guacamole was like 20 bucks. Of course I'm exaggerating, but barely. I stared at the trademark molds of white clay men diving down a wall with water rushing over it as I tried to decide between chips and dip and a margarita. Of course, the boys insisted on paying for me, but I still restrained myself to the minimum of chips and a margarita, generally feeling like shit. Because of this traumatizing event that had nothing to do with the franchise (other than their astronomical prices), I really never intended to go to ANY Rosa Mexicano ever again.Roughly a year after this event, I found myself with a SECOND new job within three months, finally getting into the flow of things and feeling secure enough vocationally and financially to treat someone who was pretty much instrumental in my hire. Being unsure of happy hour options in Flatiron/Union Square, I left it to her to pick her place. She suggested Rosa Mexicano, and I agreed.This time, we were there for happy hour (available only by the bar, which is just as well at 5: 30 p.m. when the cool, blue area is just as empty and quiet as the cavernous skylit seating area. The servers were weird when we tried to sit down, then weird when we decided to sit at the bar (having realized that happy hour deals - including food - were only applicable there).Once seated, though, the fun began. Basically, on-the-rocks margs of a few varieties are $6, or $7 if you must have 1800 in the mix. I saw lots of Michelada variants somewhere on the menu but was pretty dead set on getting a $6 margarita. The drinks were quickly made, and were very middle-of-the-road and sufficiently strong.After that empty tummy buzz started in, we realized we had to get food. The miniature happy hour special menus standing on the bar left us with some questions...for instance, what, really, could we get? How much was it?The answer was that since it was a TUESDAY, we could get ANY of their tacos (normally $18, no joke) for SIX BONES....and each serving came with two each. They normally are 3 each, or roughly $6+ per taco....meaning that even with two each at $6, we were getting a 50% discount or more. So I did a clean sweep and got an order each of Baja Fish, Scallops & Pork Belly, and Duck Tinga. And seriously, the combo was necessary to our satisfaction. The corn flour tortillas were soft and warm, the ingredients plentiful...one mistake is that I was so distracted by the deal itself that I forgot to ask for hot sauce or salsa. But even as stand alones, each taco was pretty great. Baja Fish was the truest to Mexican form, but honestly who wouldn't want a fold of scallop AND pork belly melting like marrow in your mouth? The duck was good too; didn't carry any of the overtly exotic or woodsy tones as duck is wont to do.Conclusion, folks: Happy Hour (rosamexicano.com/file/13…) is really the only way to go here because you can get full, tipsy, AND give someone the same all on your tab without feeling a cold sweat about your finances. At any other time, this would be three stars or lower based on price alone.",1,0,0,Jia J.,"New York, NY",313,474,426

The only bummer was that my stomach cramped after I was finished because I ate way too much. Everything was really good, but we did feel like we paid a little more than we hoped. There are some other places that I feel have the same high quality as Rosa Mexicano for a fraction of the cost.",0,0,1,Stacy K.,"Hamburg, Germany",39,108,15
3.0,4/23/2013,"Been here a few times over the years. It's very consistent. Not the most amazing or authentic Mexican, but it's solid and doesn't seem to disappoint. The selection of tequila is decent and its a fun date spot. The decor is pretty cool at the 18th street spot, and it's just north of union square, meaning there is a ton of stuff to do after dinner.

4.0,4/11/2013,"Upscale Mexican restaurant. First, the only negative is that it is really pricey. You can find many other good or better Mexican restaurants for maybe half the price.Aside from the price, there is nothing negative that I can say about the place. Usually you would need a reservation on friday and weekend nights, but other than that you can walk in and be seated fairly quick. The first thing I noticed was the really cool ambiance. The place has a loungy type of feel to it with colorful lights, but not too colorful and bright to give you a seizure. There is a really cool waterfall running down a huge wall which adds to a nice atmosphere.On the left side there is a bar area with a long bar and some seating. Overall, the place is unexpectedly large, with enough space between the tables not to feel cramped. It is also very clean, including the bathrooms.The first thing you are offered when you sit is their freshly made quac, which they make right in front of you. Comes in mild and spicy. Again, it is pricey, but if you get a small bowl, it is enough to feed about 3 people. Other food is also really good and freshly made. I had chicken enchiladas (3 of them on a plate). They were really good, and the sauce makes them even better.If you have a bowl of their guac, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and a couple of drinks, between 2 people, it will run you about $120. The service is excellent and friendly. If you want to try this place but don't want to break a bank, try it during their happy hour.Again, really pricey, but the food, the service and the atmosphere is great!",0,0,0,Blake B.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,180,78

Both were perfectly flavored. I went with an entree of vegetable tacos. The tacos were incredibly different, utilizing authentic vegetables such as yuca and squash and pairing them with unexpected findings such as Kale. The combination resulted in a delicious, light, little fiesta in my mouth. My friend ordered the pork tacos. He had nothing but rave reviews for his dish. The service was great.

Good deals. Good food overall. In addition to the expected finger foods and traditional margaritas, Rosa offers 1800 margs and 1800 tequila shots for about $6 bucks during happy hour. Say waaatttt ???? Yah, pretty dope right. I guess I am a sucker for good deals, but I prefer to pay a little extra to avoid bottom shelf liquors. Thanks Rosa!The appetizers were cool, but the Pastel del Queso (cheesecake filled with baked apple-cajeta sauce and candied pecans) was the star of the show.The cheesecake was the BEST we have had in NYC so far - the creamy texture and graham cracker crust were a hit; while the mini, baked apples made us Cry. Like literally, for more. We even met a lady who comes into Rosa every week, just for the cheesecake. What does that tell you? They Do Not Play. They are serious about their menu here.

Pretty big restaurant and the sitting isn't crammed.I was meeting a friend here for dinner after a couple of beers after toasting for St. Patty's day. Good we had made reservations before, highly recommend it if one doesn't intend to wait. Started with their signature frozen Pomegranate margarita which I didn't something I would wow about, just decent. My friend got the La Uniqa margarita which was pretty nice. The guacamole here is a must even though 14 bucks is on expensive side, totally worth it - must have. The chips were decent too - though feel there is a room for improvement there give the superior quality of guacamole.Ordered the chicken enchilada which came out to be very flavorful. The rice accompanied with it tasted amazing. Loved the black bean paste too. Based on one Yelp review decided to try the veggie taco and so happy we decided to get it and another reason to love YELP!!!.Ended with churros and hot chocolate. I dont recommend that - melted hot chocolate was flat- got a feeling was  made out of some american chocolate and the churros were to fat and oily.

3.0,2/6/2013,"Came here for Winter 13 NYC Restaurant Week and left with mixed thoughts on the restaurant. I really wish you can give 3.5 stars on yelp because that is what I would give here. First, the decor and restaurant is really outstanding. It has a beautiful, spacious interior with plenty of seating. There is a main room which is larger than 90% of restaurants in NYC, then there is an additional back room which basically overlooks the main room. The back room is not on a 2nd floor though as it is just slightly elevated over the main room. The restaurant tables are not on top of each other either, which is great because many restaurants have a bad habit of just trying to ""pack"" the space with as many tables as possible to squeeze in customers. Glad they thought better of it here! Also, there is a large bar on the left side of the restaurant which can serve quite a few customers if needed.The food on the other hand was on the ""ehh"" so-so side. I had the guacamole as a starter and it wasn't prepared in the best way. It's cool that someone prepares it right in front of you, but they left huge chunks of avocado in the guacamole which I had to mash up myself. For my main course, I chose the enchilada with cheese. Honestly, it didn't impress me at all. It was pretty plain in that it was completely dominated with just cheese inside. I can't speak for the other dishes, but looking around at other tables, nothing looked like it stood out either. This is a nice restaurant to have a dinner, especially with large groups, and there is plenty of seating so the danger of not making reservations and lucking out should be low. However, I came here on a Monday night so I'm assuming it would be a bit more crowded towards the weekend. As for the RW menu, it's a pass as there are many better options out there.

The venue is spacious and chic. I noticed that there are a few people enjoying the happy hour. They also offer, half off on a few items on their appetizers. My personal favorite is the Panza con Callos de Hacha (Pork Belly and Scallops) taco - on a corn tortilla, you have  Kurobuta pork belly, topped with seared scallops and orange-habanero salsa.

The fresh made Guacamole was awesome. Now the actual lunch....ehhh, not so good. Extremely small portioned, but it was tasty, can't lie about that, but so are Ritz crackers. Thought the place was nice enough, figured, next time, I'll just order more food. I figured the place was beautifully decorated and laid back enough that it'd make a great date spot.On my 2nd visit, the restaurant was extremely crowded and went from being cool laid back, to Wall Street-like posh/ borderline Boigie. The crowd was way to overdress and it seemed like a scene from ""Sex in the City"", you know, the girls weren't too pretty, but had enough money to make their clothes radiate something they were lacking. When I finally got a table, the dinner menu was anything but Mexican....guess they had to change the menu once the moon came up and the freaks came out; ""gotta cater to all those 'Samantha's' in the crowd."" If the idea of looking like a Cliche New Yorker, and representing everything TV depicts us to be, and this seems empowering to you, then go ahead and drop $100 on a Not-So-Mexican dinner.

1.0,12/1/2012,"Not impressed...at all! My boyfriend was visiting me from out of town this weekend, and we decided to get what we thought would be authentic Mexican food. Our first impression of this place was the elaborate, modern,and flashy decor, which made for a nice atmosphere. The hostess was mildly pleasant as she greeted us right away..but it was down hill from there. We ordered the Tortilla soup and Guacamole to start. My boyfriend has a cheese allergy  so we specifically inquired as to whether the soup contained any dairy, and also told the waitress about his allergy. She assured us that the cheese was separate  from the soup and that he could have his soup without any dairy. Soup came, cheese was in it. He just ate the broth around it. Guacamole was made to order right in front of us, while seated. This was a nice touch and we couldn't wait to try the fresh guac. Too bad the guy making it seemed like he had no interest whatsoever in being there and put no effort in interacting with us . The guac. was so blah and basic, no herbs, no spices, not even any fresh lime juice. Just very bland. For our main dishes, I ordered the fish tacos, which I had seen advertised on their website and looked really good. My boyfriend ordered the skillet stake emphasizing again his cheese allergy as there was cheese on this dish. Once again, his meal came out smothered in cheese, and the food runner's response to us saying that was not how we order it was ""oh, really"". And that was it. It then took another 15 minutes of waiting for them to replace his order. Meanwhile, the fish tacos I ordered literally had no taste, and were so gross. I was let down by the cold, hard fish sticks and could not even eat them. When the steak came out, our waitress delivered it to us and set it down and walked away, with no acknowledgment of the fact that the order was made wrong. For a restaurant to get a food allergy wrong not only once, but twice and be so emotionless about it says a lot about a place and what such poor management it has.  On top of the negative dining experience, we both literally felt bloated and uncomfortable all day. Maybe it was because of all the grease and sodium our meals were prepared with. To be honest with you I'm still mad at my boyfriend for being so nice and not even making any issues of it, and even tipping the blah waitress 15%, after such crappy service, and not even a ""Thanks, have a good day.

2.0,9/4/2012,"I came here about 3 times and had an average experience but the last time i visited, was my worst experience by far. I brought my friend here for her 21st bday & had a double date. Guacamole was awesome but very little! Our table had the Tortilla pie, Enchilada D' Mole, Fish Tacos & short ribs. The Tortilla pie was the best dish. Soft, moist, & saucy. Enchilada D' Mole had an awkward taste. If you're not up to trying new things, DON'T GET THE ENCHILADA D' MOLE! Fish tacos was nothing special. Fried fish with tartar sauce. Short ribs was a disappointment.. Dry & no flavor!The worst part was... i went to use the bathroom as a excuse to order a birthday dessert for my friend. I specifically request to not have the dessert menus brought to us and to bring the dessert right after our table was clear. The host walked me to the manager and i spoke to him as well.When our table was clear.. Dessert menus was placed on our tables. I was still hopeful that SOMEONE would eventually bring the dessert i requested. 10 minutes passed and NOTHING was brought to us. i kept eyeing for the manager or host but they were no where to be found.

The Himachi Tacos (under the ceviche menu) were one of the best things Ive ever tasted! The dinner was also great; filet mignon tacos.

4.0,8/19/2012,"I'm the first to admit:  I am surprised how much I enjoyed Rosa Mexicano.Everyone raves about the guacamole prepared table-side -- for good reason.  It's outstanding.  While I often find praise over-hyped, this guacamole was certifiably guacalicious.  The table-side preparation also was not a gimmick.  The server prepared it in an unassuming way, with no flamboyant display of knives chopping and arms flailing where Republicans from Middle America drop their eyes in amazement about the productive contribution that illegal immigrants can make to society.  In fact, our table of six barely noticed him, and in a matter of just a few minutes, two orders -- one spicy and one mild -- were presented to our table without our missing one beat of conversation.  While I hesitate to throw superlatives around, this is among the finest guacamole I've eaten, likely because the Haas avocados were riped to perfection.  The spice level was skewed towards the mild, and even one member of our party who is spice-averse found herself gravitating towards the ""spicy"" guacamole.  This was no anomaly.  We loved the guacamole so much that we ordered a third ""extra, extra picante maximo"" which was more flavorful overall, but offered no more heat.For an entree, I chose the Enchiladas Suiza with roasted local vegetables. At the risk of repeating myself, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed them.  As a vegetarian, I often worry that my options are limited (and, indeed, they often are, even at Mexican restaurants).  To be sure, Rosa Mexicana does not have a multitude of options for the vegetarian (and even fewer, if any, for the vegan. In fact, I'm not sure there are any vegan offerings).  To my recollection, there were three:  the tacos with local roasted vegetables, the Enchiladas Suiza with local roasted vegetables, and the special of the day, the chile relllenos, only offered on Sundays.  There were also enchiladas with Veracruz mole, but mole is typically prepared with chicken stock and therefore not vegetarian.  I confirmed this as well with the waitress, and appreciated her knowledge and familiarity with the menu and the ingredients that comprise the food's preparation.The Enchiladas Suiza were, in a word, delicious.  Served hot (not warm) with perfectly cooked vegetables that provided a perfect crunch and a slightly, but not overly-so, tangy tomatillo sauce.  I would unhesitatingly order them again.  That said, on any other day of the week, I have two options only -- the tacos and the Enchiladas Suiza -- so the menu could stand to be a bit more varied for vegetarians.Everyone at our table was delighted with their meals.  Two people ordered the carne asada flank steak and loved it.  One person ordered the fish tacos and reported that they were very good.  Another got the chicken pie (could this be made vegetarian?  I didn't ask), and raved throughout the meal.  The final person ordered the same thing that I did -- the Enchiladas Suiza -- but with chicken.As for drinks, three of us sampled different kinds of margaritas while two shared a pitcher of the organic sangria, replete with cucumber vodka.  Surprising to say, the sangria was much better than the margaritas.  The sangria was outstanding, refreshing, and delicious.  I tried both a tradicional margarita (but upgraded to an organic, 100% agave tequila) and also the Cadillac margarita.  I preferred (by far) the tradicional.  Word of Warning:  the base margarita (tradicional) is NOT prepared with 100% agave tequila.  I believe all others are, but if this matters to you, check.  It could vary from location to location.On a different note, the Union Square branch is a large, beautiful space.  We sat in the atrium in the back.  It was very comfortable with perfect temperature control.The reason for conferring only four stars on Rosa Mexicano is threefold.  First, our server was excellent overall, but she dropped the ball on getting a gluten free menu to one of the people in our group.  We asked for the gluten-free menu at least three times, and it took -- no joke -- a half an hour before it arrived.  To be fair, 85% of the normal menu is also gluten-free, which begs the question why they don't simply designate which items are or can be prepared gluten-free on one menu.  At the same time, if they have a gluten-free menu and offer a gluten-free menu, they should make an effort to get it to their gluten-free patrons in a timely fashion.  Second, the alcohol menu was expensive, in my opinion, for what was offered.  The margaritas were small, didn't pack any punch, and the Cadillac margarita in particular, wasn't very good.  Third, they should enhance their vegetarian menu, which could be done with relative ease.Looking at the website, I see that Rosa Mexicano is supposed to open a branch in downtown San Francisco.  Despite the wealth of Mexican restaurants in San Francisco, Oakland, and the Bay Area in general, it'd be a welcome addition.Recommended.",1,0,0,SalsaBoy S.,"Oakland, CA",53,417,104
2.0,8/18/2012,"Ehhh definitely not even close to the best Mexican you can find in NYC, but it serves its purpose.  I'd rather walk 10 more blocks and hit up Dos Caminos if I had my choice between the two.  Yeah, it's kind of cool that they make your guacamole at the table, but it isn't even great guacamole.  Not enough tomatoes, too many onions and cilantro.  I even added a boat load of jalapenos to mine and the taste was still bland.  For an entree I had the ceviche sampler and I wasn't that impressed.  My friend's fish tacos were fried and served with tarter sauce.. yuck.  Mystery over.. I won't make an effort to return.",1,0,1,Julie G.,"London, United Kingdom",677,999,19
3.0,8/17/2012,"In a word; nice.Between the large wall waterfall, high ceilings, and bright colors, 18th Street location is a beautiful place to have a meal. The problem being that the service and the food don't necessary live up to that atmosphere surrounding them. The table-side guacamole was missing something, with my direct comparison being the table side guacamole at Dos Caminos. Beyond that one dish was sent back and it wasn't until well after everyone had finished their main courses that it was replaced, all in all a terribly slow place for a corporate lunch. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the complexity and depth of the mole used for the chicken tinga enchiladas, and everyone seemed to enjoy the margaritas.If Rosa Mexicano is convenient, keep it in mind as an option, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first or second choice.",1,0,0,Armand K.,"Manhattan, NY",135,116,297

The queso fundido was good but there wasn't much shrimp or chilies in it. Got the fish tacos, the pork belly and scallop tacos and the crabmeat enchiladas. The tacos were both good but I liked the fish tacos a little bit better. The pork belly was a little dry. The enchiladas were OK, there was a good amount of crab meat in them but the tortilla was fried and the dish cam out almost like a sandwich (between two fried tortillas). The organic sangria was light and refreshing, but there didn't seem to be a whole lot of alcohol in it.

I really can't tell whether the bartenders aren't fluent in English or whether they don't care to listen to your orders. The last time I was there, there were two bartenders serving us, and neither of them explained to us that the happy our appetizer wasn't to share. We get it and it's one half of a taco. Seriously?! Seriously. At that same time, I had asked one of them if they can utrn the channel on the tv. All she did was nod, then....did nothing thereafter. But this time i went? We had THREE bartenders waiting on us, noe of whom had any serving skills. My friend asked for a lemon for her water, and the woman never gave it to her. She had to ask another bartender to do so.  I asked for a menu and she nodded but never provided one (even though she had about 15 menus in her hand0. When I asked her again, she gave it to me. Then one of them asked to hold our credit card for the tab. I gave her mine, and mentioned that I do NOT want this card charged just held (like you're supposed to do with the tab). She didn't say anything, so i said it again and she only nodded (again). Then when it was time to get the bill, I asked for it from another bartender (because both of our other ones disappeared), and I mentioned to him that I do NOT want the card charged, just send us the bill. What does he do? Charge the card. 1)  I said at least there times (including 10 seconds before) that I do not want the card charged (HOW WAS THAT NOT CLEAR?), and 2) You are supposed to asked the person whether they want that card charged first before you go ahead and charge the thing.

I walked in about 8:05pm and checked in with the hostess. I was told, ""You're 10 minutes early. Come back at 8:15!"" I was blown away at the attitude. Why couldn't she tell me simply my table wouldn't be ready until 8:15, get a drink at the bar, etc and she'll call me? So, at 8:15 I went back and she sat me at a table that was open at 8:05 and stayed empty. Now, if that wasn't enough, it was hot in the restaurant. It was as though the AC was not working at all. Then our waiter, ""Luis C"" came over he told us in a abrupt way that we needed to decide if we wanted to order from the Restaurant Week menu or not. At that time was asked if something was wrong with the AC. He told us, ""NO! It's always like this. If you don't like it, you can decide to leave."" Then he walked away.

We split a pitcher of sangria that didn't taste alcoholic, My girlfriend ordered from the restaurant week ""prix-fixe"" menu, and I ordered tacos. Our server was a nice young man (just a bit awkward). We ordered the guacamole as soon as we sat down. Since my girlfriend was considering ordering from the restaurant week menu,  she asked our server if the guacamole that is normally portioned for 2 ppl was the same portion on the restaurant week menu and if we would be charged extra for both eating it (it said 'additional $6 per person'.)  It was a simple question which he wasn't able to give us a straight answer to. I don't know if he didn't understand the question or just wasn't that familiar with how restaurant week worked but It seemed like he was just trying to appease her and have her order from the restaurant week menu. He told her that if you ordered 3 things off that menu in the end it would all add up to 35$  but on the check each item will have a price . This didn't answer the question but we just let it go because he was obviously busy and already walking away. After we finished our meal he asked if we wanted dessert-- she asked, ""well,  my meal comes with it, right?"" and he replied, ""yea"" so she orders a dessert (wouldn't have ordered it had it not been part of the ""prix fixe"") When we got the check everything was priced exactly how it was on the regular menu and her portion definitely did not add up to the ""prix fixe"" $35.  It was about $12 more (exactly the price of the dessert) - which wouldn't have been that big of a deal had she not asked very specific questions throughout the meal about what was covered under the deal. and when she asked why it was more expensive he said he would check for her-- a few minutes later, he drops the check of at the table and says ""yeah it was because of the dessert- thanks for understanding""  and walks away.

Okay so the guacamole isn't exactly ""chain-like;"" made table side it packs some pretty incredible flavor and heat. Everyone enjoys the experience of having their food made in front of them so that gives Rosa some extra brownie points. For an entree I split the crispy pork belly and scallop tacos and the fried fish tacos. The fish tacos were decent but shaped sort of like fish sticks, giving it off a low-quality feel - the fish itself was kind of fresh. The crispy pork belly was excellent but the scallops were undercooked and the dish arrived cold. The scallops did not bring anything to the party in this taco. My friend and I agreed if we had not had some leftover guacamole that the tacos may have been a bit sad tasting. The restaurant itself is huge for a Manhattan space making it perfect to bring big parties. The service was good and the manager was walking about at the lunch hour.

3.0,7/4/2012,"Good, but not stellar mexican.  Drinks: I tried the clasica margarita, which was much too sour.  needed more sweet.  surprisingly, the skinny margarita was better tasting and sweeter.  Later, tried the red sangria and that was even better.  Shocking that the individual size sangria came in a mini pitcher for only $12.00, giving 2 sangrias.  Even more economical was the La Sangrita michelada.  For $7.00 got a really tall glass!  The michelada was very good, though it was almost too much spicyness and by the end I couldn't actually finish it.Appetizers: The ceviche sampler was a nice selection.  The pescado part was the best, as the crispy ham was a nice touch.  The Callo De Hacha was interesting with its inclusion of hazelnuts, but otherwise I didn't care so much for it.  The Atun was average though certainly edible.Entrees:  My dinner companion had the Alambre a La mexicana (the ""Tuesday special"").  While there were parts to the steak very well cooked (and spiced for just the right lingering flavor), it was inconsistently cooked.  Some parts were medium well, when she ordered medium.  I had the Chamorro.  While the pork wasn't perfect, it did have enough ""fall of the phone"" goodness to make a return order worth it.  The creamed spinach was there as well but no overwhelming.  I actually didn't need the tortillas that came with the chamorro, since the chili, spinach and pork shank were enough on their own.  I will say that the black beans that came with the meals were subpar.Dessert: Had the Flan de Rosa, which was layered dessert with a brownie on the bottom.  My dining companion has always made clear her dislike for flan's consistency.  Didn't matter to me since I like it.  And Rosa de Mexicano makes a good one.  The whipped cream was cinnamon flavored.  Your (dis)like depends on how much you like cinnamon (I do).  The best part about the dessert was the chili brownie, something we could both agree was worth the price of the dessert.All and all, I did like this restaurant.  The ambiance was a little too trendy for us, though for me atmosphere can be overrated anyway.  A good restaurant is about the service, food and drinks, the look should be the lowest priority.  However, while I wouldn't mind going here again, I don't think I will seek out this restaurant for a long while.  Too many other restaurants in Manhattan do a better job on mexican cuisine.",1,0,0,Greg B.,"Long Island City, NY",28,46,0

Service is alright, not slow but not fast or very personable. Always came accurately though, which is important. Had the Civeche sampler to start. Really to die for, and the only thing worth the price. very small portion, but when you are working with raw fish, it needs to be top quality, and this obviously was.The frozen margarita pomegranate thing was yummy I guess. Not worth $12 for that little thing and especially with non-Patron Liquor. They didn't even have Patron listed on their menu, so it was probably like $18 per mixed drinks. The drinks really were just OK, tequila was kind of lame and very expensive, but decently strengthened drink.I had the Filet Mignon tacos, and they really were fantastic. I thought the Steak was really well cooked, and the goat cheese spread was a great touch! again not worth $24. Not worried about the portion size, though small, ,it's more about the quality, and it wasn't there for that price.I live in Harlem, so i can get some pretty bad-ass Churros for 50 cents each, but these were really out of this world! so fresh and juicy on the inside.

2.0,6/21/2012,"I've come to the conclusion that the majority of business dinners are characterized with the following:1. gorgeous, presentable space (upscale, if not fine dining)2. overpriced food3. mediocre food4. one person who monopolizes the conversationRosa Mexicano is no exception. The upscale fancy chain sits in the former space of America. It's vast with many rooms, my favorite being the backroom. Looks like you're sitting outdoors but with air conditioning. All that's missing is the sound of birds. My experience at Rosa Mexicano reminded me of the line from Once Upon a Time in Mexico. ""Are you a Mexi-can or a Mexi-can't?"" Rosa Mexicano you Mexi-can't! The food is Americanized to suit most palates.We started off with the tableside guacamole. While the guacamole always gets rave reviews, I found it completely lackluster. We ordered it spicy and it was not spicy at all. The waitress even said their jalapenos were weak. The avocados were sliced chunky as well. The guacamole guy could have mashed it in the mortar a little longer. For $14, I find this an abominable price to pay.Our second appetizer was the grilled corn on the cob. It was good slathered in cheese, cream, and chile. However underneath the charred kernels was soft mushy corn. I wondered if the corn used by Rosa Mexicano was frozen and not fresh.For entrees we got the fish tacos, filet mignon tacos, and special of the day braised lamb shank. The tacos were okay but hideously overpriced at $24. They were three miniature tacos that could easily be bought for about $2 each at a real taqueria. Alas, we were fine dining. The filet mignon tacos at Rosa Mexicano come with goat cheese. Not. A. Winner. The lamb shank was gigantic, tender, and flavorful. That was the best dish of the night. Not only was it done well, it also came with tortillas, beans, and house rice which was flavored with chicken broth and cilantro. Dessert was delicious- espresso flan and homemade ice cream (Mexican Vanilla, Banana Cinnamon Swirl, Sea Salt Cajeta). The ice cream was out of this world. My only wish was that they'd work on the presentation more. They threw the three scoops into one bowl on top of each other. It didn't take too long for it to all melt into an ice cream soup.Two other things worth mentioning. We requested a gluten free menu and they did not have any printed ones on hand. The waitress was nice enough to recommend what was gluten free based on modifications to the dishes. Also, the table next to us was having a 40th birthday party. They were instructed to not put any decorations (confetti, napkins, etc.) on their table. Party poopers!With all that said, I probably won't be going back to Rosa Mexicano. It is a happening chic restaurant that you can take guests to, but for Mexican food it is not that great. I'd rather get 100 tacos from Taco Bell. For a corporate dinner, it fits the bill and the frozen pomegranate margaritas will keep you talking. Similar to Dos Caminos but equally not impressive.",8,6,6,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1493,1730

He said something confusing about seating us at 9:59 (it was 7:25). When I questioned it, he giggled and said it would be a few minutes so I assumed he was kidding. 15 minutes later my sister went back to check and was told the same thing about 9:59. When she questioned it, he said there were two parties ahead of us. We foolishly continued to wait. 10 minutes later she went back to check again and was told it would be just a few minutes. Between these last two check ins, we watched them seat several 2-tops and at least three 3- or 4-tops. I had to stop the host and ask one more time before we were seated. It was bad enough that we had to wait an hour and thirty-five minutes to sit down, but the host staff was really rude too. They acted as if they were doing us a favor and we were rude for inquiring as to what was going on. The fun didn't end when we sat down. Our server was nice, the food was ok, the guacamole was delicious, but service was really slow. Our server even commented on the slow service and apologized. At the end of our meal we asked to speak to the manager. Much to our chagrin, the manager was one of the rude folks at the host stand. He tried to make excuses instead of apologizing and trying to make it right. I had to ask him if he would comp some part of our meal.

Gone.  I asked about the tacos, which used to come on a large dish with the ingredients separated and the meat or whatever sizzling in a square cast iron vessel with cheese.  No more.  They assemble them in the kitchen so how they give it is how you'll eat it.I had a steak quesadilla, which was actually good, but it was really just a large appetizer or party fingerfood.  My friend had the fish taco, which was basically 4 (freshly made) fish sticks on small tortillas.  Again, it looked like party food.  Oh.. the guac... we ordered it spicy, which in the past would have been mildly spicy.  The guy repeated it back and what he gave us was bland to the point that the tortillas had more flavor.  Eating a bite on its own was like just eating some plain avocado. I'm not sure how the chain is doing financially, but it seems like the beancounters restructured the menu and how the food is prepared.  I guess it's better for them to stay in business with a crappy menu than to close down trying to give me a mixed grill.  Either way, not going back.It was funny, though.  When I asked the waitress what happened to the menu she pointed out a new appetizer and was talking that and another new thing on the menu and really wouldn't comment about all the other stuff that was gone.",2,1,0,John F.,"Short Hills, NJ",3,29,0

There was a mistake on our bill but that was rectified. We gave the bartender my friend's credit card to hold our tab. We ended up paying with cash and left without getting her card back. My friend called and was told it wasn't at the restaurant. I called back on her behalf and spoke to a woman, whose name I didn't get. I told her my friend's first and last name and that it was a chase card. She couldn't find the card at first, but spoke to a manager and said they found a Citibank card and said my friend's full name, including her middle name. I didn't' give her my friend's middle name. I said my friend would be there that evening to pick it up. The manager told her it would be put in the safe and my friend could pick it up whenever. My friend got to Rosa Mexicano around 7pm that evening and was told that there was no card for her there. I was not with my friend and didn't have the name of the person that I spoke to, which was not smart on my part. I called back the next morning, because I really wanted my friend to get her card back.  I spoke to Jose, who looked for me again when I explained my friend going there twice but not getting her card back. Jose said no card was found. I told him a card had to be there since I was told so the day before and that the woman even knew the full name of my friend, as well as what type of card it was. Jose said there must have been a mistake and the card belonged to someone else. This simply doesn't make any sense and is very shady. I am sure that there is a practice in place to store credit cards that are left behind at the bar. Since we were there between 6:15 and 10pm, there must be a way to speak to the bartender who helped us and find out where he or his colleague (the second bartender who later joined him behind the bar) put the credit card. There has to be a way to track this.  It's very frustrating that no one seemed to care that my friend's card was missing.  I would like some accountability in terms of how nonchalant the management seems to be regarding finding the card.  I definitely will not be going back here.",0,0,0,Mona H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0

If  you go here, you must have the guacamole! It is the absolute BEST! The waiter makes it right infront of you according to your liking. The food is perfectly seasoned. The portions are huge, and the dessert is mouthwatering and fantastic. My favorite is the salted caramel ice cream, and the mexican vanilla ice cream. The sangrias are also delicious!

2.0,5/7/2012,"Don't come here unless you are willing to wait, reservations be damned.  We had a party of four and we had a 730pm reservation.  My friend and I arrived at 715pm and we told the hostess about our reservation, but she would not seat us until our whole group was present.  My two other friends ended up getting to the restaurant around 735pm and when we approached the hostess this time, she handed us one of those waiting devices that goes off when your table is available.  We reminded her that we had a 730pm reservation and that we had been there technically since 715pm.  She said it could not be helped, but we should not have to wait long.  Fast forward to 830pm and our device finally went off and we went up to the hostess and handed her the device.  She checked some things on the computer and a bus boy comes over and whispers something into her ear.  The hostess tells us that the table they had for us was too small and would not sit all four of us comfortably.  An additional ten minute wait later and we were finally seated.  We ordered esquites and the large guacamole for an appetizer and for the entrees we ordered the chicken enchiladas, lumb crab enchiladas, fish tacos and chicken tacos.  The large guacamole that was supposed to feed 4-6 people was very small and seemed more appropriate for 2-3 people.  The esquites which is a corn with crema dish was tasty, but also very small.  The waitress got one of our orders wrong and brought us two fish tacos instead of one fish and one chicken.  All of the entrees were decent, but none of them really stuck out.  The restaurant is chic and trendy and has a very good Happy Hour special.  If I do visit this establishment again, I am eating at the bar.  Table service is horrendous.",0,0,0,vincent c.,"Holmdel, NJ",71,45,70

Awesome!The service was a little slow, but this may have been because there was a wedding reception going on it the back room of the restaurant (what a great location!). We both ordered la tradicional margaritas with sugar rims, and they were TINY! Tasty, but too tiny for the price ($11, but I do live in Philly where you can easily get a comparable margarita, 2.5 glasses worth, for $7, non-happy hour prices. Copabanana anyone?), but they were strong... not sure if that makes up for their size or not. I LOVE how the guac is made fresh at your table. I was so impressed by that. I would've liked more lime & a little more salt, but I wasn't hungry, so I didn't feel the need to complain. I'll remember to ask for more of each next time. The fresh tortilla chips needed a little salt (I'm not a salt fiend, but food should be seasoned accordingly). I didn't try the mini soft tortillas they gave us or the additional sauces, but all in all, the food was very fresh, but just okay in terms of flavor.Next time I go back, I'll try a few dishes from the menu, and will order more guac, but have them make it with more lime & salt.Yes, I did peep the salt shaker on the table, but when I'm paying for food in a restaurant, I don't want to do anything to it, but eat it.I would, however, like to give the decor and ambiance *****, 5 stars.

Washed it down with a couple of margaritas, two pomegranate and one classic.  Always a good combination!For dinner, we had the crispy pork shank, grilled skirt steak and chipotle shrimp and the chicken enchiladas. The enchiladas were topped with a nice cream sauce and the tortillas were soft.  The skirt steak never disappoints and this time was no exception.  The ever-so-slightly spicy chipotle shrimp was a nice addition to the skirt steak.  The crispy pork shank was out of this world.  Tender and juicy yet a nice crispy skin. The pork is placed on top of a spinach with mushrooms, two of my hated foods...I asked the waitress (BTW our waitress was spot on, attentive and very helpful!) if she could substitute something.  When the dish arrived she explained she had the chef used the kale, pancetta and sweet corn ragu that is served with the salmon.  Wow, what a great choice, they should use that everytime!  It had a slightly acidic taste that paired well with the salty bacon and sweet corn.Definitely a great dinner, service and experience.",0,0,0,Kurt H.,"Manhattan, NY",5,69,25

3.0,3/22/2012,"Rosa Mexicano is definitely not a bad spot. It is just kind of overpriced and weird which prevents me from loving it. I went for a work lunch so I wasn't paying, which made me feel happy, but the prices made me feel sad for my future self who might consider going back when I do not have a free meal. The space is enormous and very classy, I especially liked these large walls with waterfalls on them that separate the bar from the restaurant. When we arrived around noon it was empty but by the time we left there were a good number of tables filled. But here is what I mean by weird. First off our server was just plain awkward. She would ask the strangest questions - like when the place was still empty and we ordered she asked if we had time constraints. Um, why? I mean I guess that's really considerate but it was just strange. But she was nice and she did everything we needed her to do, so she was not bad at all. Also, the food is kind of strange. Instead of serving items with real cheese, they serve them with some strange cheese sauce. I don't know, cheese sauce is gross to me while cheese is amazing. And it's Mexican food so there should be melted cheese on everything. God, I must have stayed in Texas for too long to even say that, but it's true.I did enjoy the guacamole and my carne asada tacos were fine. The portion was huge, I am a big eater and I couldn't remotely finish it.

2.0,3/3/2012,"As a hard-core fanatic of Mexican food, I was delighted when I was invited to the famous restaurant Rosa Mexicano.  We had a party of 14, and after reading the amazing reviews, we were filled with great expectations. As I arrived for my evening dinner, I was amazed with the great ambiance and the soft, subtle music in the background. The place looks amazing! Everything from the amazing Mexican wall paintings, to the amazing bar, to the walls covered in colored crystal curtains that formed beautiful red roses, were beginning to fulfill all of my high expectations. Service was great, and since we were a group of 14 we were fortunate enough to have two waiters serving our table. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed when the food arrived. As appetizers we ordered several guacamoles, a dish I assumed no Mexican restaurant was ever going to get wrong; the guacamole was unsalted and I was even more disappointed when it wasn't spicy like we had ordered it. Looking past the appetizer letdown, I ordered a Mexican basic, Chicken tacos. When I received my order, I was amazed at the beautiful presentation and how the tortillas were wonderfully place in a beautiful pink container that was completely adorable. With the presentation, my taste buds expected to be bombarded with great flavors, and again, I was let down. The chicken was good, but it had way too many peppers and onions for my liking, the refried beans were again, unsalted, and had a weird sour taste to them, and the corn was clearly poured from a can. I was highly disappointed and was unable to finish the meal that I had paid 20$ for. Typically great chicken tacos can range from $2.00 to $15.00 depending on the scale of the place you are in; this one was overpriced and for no reason at all. Since the food didn't work out for my friends and I, we decided to order several pitchers of red wine sangria to share and converse. Surprisingly, my taste buds were finally being delighted! The sangria was amazing, didn't have too much alcohol, and had just the correct amount of fruits inside. I also ordered a frozen pomegranate margarita for myself and it was delish!  We didn't enjoy the food, but the drinks were amazing and we enjoyed our evenings after our plates were removed from the table. I don't quite recommend this place if you are planning to experience good Mexican cuisine, but if you want to experience good ambiance and have good sangria with some friends; this can be quite a nice option.",1,1,0,Leslie L.,"Schenectady, NY",1,9,0

3.0,3/2/2012,"Cliff Notes: Tastes bland, like chain restaurant food, nice atmosphere and very friendly, but slow service.I read previous reviews about the wait to be seated so I made sure to arrive 15 minutes prior to my 8:45pm reservation. (The party that accompanied me was tired and had to work the next day.) And I figured that if I made reservations through Yelp, I would get prompt service since they knew I would likely write a review. Well they still made me wait an extra 15 minutes after the planned reservation of 8:45. So 30 minutes at the bar, not too bad, just kind of annoying.My friend had tried to talk me out of the restaurant saying that it's ""chain food"" (much like Chili's or Friday's) and had recommended some other places to dine. I had a great experience at the Rosa Mexicano in D.C. and being that I live in Asia right now, I wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a Mexican restaurant I hadn't been too.Well he was right. The food isn't bad, just a little bland. It doesn't taste like that quirky Mexican restaurant with the sloppy decor and cliche mariachi music in the background. Essentially you are paying for the ambiance (which is clean and atheistically pleasing to the eye) and familiar food. Much like the standard of McDonald's food all over the world in that it isn't great, you just know what you're getting no matter where you are in the world.The waitress was pleasant.

We waited for 20 mins to get to the bar & bought a round of drinks.

After well over an hour of waiting for a table, we ordered & our server was very friendly & cordial. The margaritas were tasty, but overpriced. The waiter was insistent that we order the guacamole, so we did... big mistake. It was $30 for a double order - that was 2 avocados & definitely not worth it, unless you like the pretentious ""tableside presentation"" & lack of flavor. The entrees were all fine, but limited & again small portions & way overpriced. We were out celebrating a special occasion & could not hear ourselves or carry on a conversation. The final disappointment was when we asked for the bill & discreetly wanted to use our gift card, it could not be processed (after waiters & managers tried for 30 mins). It was a valid gift card as they could see, but the ""system"" couldn't process the transaction.

My friend and I both ordered the salmon and I must say this was my favorite part. The salmon comes with sweet corn and some sweet paste stuff on top. I really enjoyed the salmon. The other really great part about their restaurant week menu is that you can substitute your dessert for a drink and we both did that. The margaritas here are surprisingly good for being frozen. We also ordered the churros for dessert, they come with three different dipping sauces. This place is usually overpriced especially for Mexican food but if you can come here during restaurant week it's a pretty good deal.",0,0,0,Elianny S.,"Astoria, NY",159,368,1449

4.0,1/18/2012,"Didn't realize that this place was a chain. Been to the one in Sutton Place, thought it was pretty good, and was interested to see how another store in the chain compared.The decor in this version of the restaurant is a lot lighter and the place feels more open over all (ie less intimate but more welcoming if you're not on a date!). The guac here is great and will have you scraping the sides of the stone bowl with your tortilla chips (they even threw in some tortillas for us!). The cheese fondue we had was also pretty darn good. The entrees were still good but not mind-blowing; I had the chicken tacos, which were cool in that the different elements came in small bowls and you constructed them yourself.For lunch they have a prix fixe menu, but none of us actually went for it. Most people in our group just ate the appetizers we got for the table plus one more appetizer. Total with tip came out to around $20-25 per.",0,0,0,Allen Y.,"Manhattan, NY",94,361,1

4.0,1/16/2012,"Considering that NYC Mexican food does not come even close to Mexican food from the Southwest, Rosa Mexicano has some great flavors, even though it is kinda expensive.The first few times I went here, it was for dinner. The prices are very high for what you are getting. The other few times I have been here were for drinks and apps in the bar area, still expensive. I like the bar area a lot better though. Let's start out with their drinks: What I love about Rosa's margaritas is they are not made with sweet and sour. They taste like an authentic margarita. Nothing is worse than ordering a margarita and getting a headache from the sugar. The frozen pomegranate margarita is TO DIE FOR! It is not overly sweet and it has a great balance of natural tastes and tequila. They do not skimp on the alcohol. I will have two and feel like I landed on the moon. Also try their Mango Margarita, which is served on the rocks. I am not a big sangria drinker, but Rosa's white as well as red sangria tastes very good compared to other restaurants. Their apps are awesome. Get the guacamole, the queso fundido, and the chicken soft tacos. This is plenty for two people. Also, keep in mind that there are chips and salsa: one red sauce and one green sauce. They tend to be spicy, which is great! They also give you fresh tortillas, which are still warm. Did I mention that they have a half price drink/app menu from 4-7 everyday but Friday? SCORE!My advice: great spot for happy hour, drinks/apps.

Novel! We arrived late to our reservation but they were accommodating and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was a little harried and had little patience for pleasantries, which was unexpected but not entirely off-putting.We started with the guacamole, which was perfect. Big chunks of guacamole, not too many red onions, well seasoned. I was a little disappointed that they didn't come by our table to make the guacamole tableside, as was advertised, but it was delicious either way.I had the steak tacos. The meat was beautifully seasoned, and went well with both the salsa verde as well as the side of corn. My companion had the chicken enchiladas, which were passable, if a little dry. The rice was a little under, the beans a little over, but as long as I smothered everything in guac, it was all a-ok.I'd return to satisfy a guac craving.

They prepare it to your specific taste right at the table! (I only felt a little awkward because I wasn't sure if we were supposed to talk to him while he mixed, or watch with awed silence, or what. But it worked out.)We ordered a pitcher of sangria; it was stocked with lots of fruit & I loved it. The food was good. I wish the sauces that came with my dish were labeled or explained, because I can't handle spicy foods & one of the sauces was liquid fire. But besides that, my food was good - and my friends enjoyed their dishes as well. Our meal was a bit on the expensive side for what we ordered, but that's what comes with the territory I guess.I'd recommend Rosa Mexicano to people looking for a fun experience with some great guacamole.

A few of us had the individual jugs of sangria (a bargain at $6, it's $12 at the end of happy hour) and were seated in a nice alcove area at the front of the restaurant. When we were all sufficiently hungry and in need of a good feed after all the sangria we had consumed, we enquired about a table. We were informed it would take more than 2 hours which was fair given it was a Saturday night. We chose to stay at our cozy spot and ordered. I had the soft tortilla chicken tacos which were great! The chicken tasted fresh and the sides of beans, rice and corn were delicious.The only reason I hesitate to give this 4 stars is the price. My main cost $20 including tax although I noticed a whole section of the menu had other mains at around $25. Rosa Mexicano is nice, but in my opinion, not $25 main course nice.

Come on...Anyway, we had the chicken flautas (kind of bland), queso fundido (YUM, cheesy and chorizo goodness), and the ceviche (very tasty and refreshing).  Everything was pretty tasty but my main reason for coming here is and always will be that damn delicious guacamole.",0,0,0,Megan C.,"Bristol, United Kingdom",22,136,5
4.0,8/8/2011,"Pink pomegranate margaritas during happy hour are amazing. I never sat down to have a meal from their menu, but I did sit at the bar area and have 3 of these ridiculously delicious and strong margaritas. I was almost flat out drunk by the end of my third one. It was scary how quickly it hit and how good I felt. Warning.. as with all tequila you'll probably get that tequila dry throat so water is recommended afterwards. So smart to make alcohol make you happy and more thirsty. I'm not sure what this place is like after happy hour, but why not just come here for happy hour? Guac and chips was solid (although not as good as dos caminos), and the rest of the appetizers were also decent.  It does get rather crowded, so I'd recommend getting there early or trying to reserve a table ahead of time.",1,0,0,Clemens W.,"New York, NY",467,235,596
4.0,8/6/2011,"Better than Dos Caminos. Sexy Mexican restaurant right off of 5th Avenue in Union Square with a nice ambiance. Pretty attentive service. Good food, but pretty expensive. Signature pomegranate margarita (which was deliciously strong) was kind of small for an $11.50 price tag. Their sangria looks good. Guacamole for the table comes in mild, medium or hot - we opted for the medium, which was still pretty spicy. Chicken enchiladas were interesting (in a good way).

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with my meal at all. The exceptions were the Sangria that I ordered which was delicious and allowed me to get more bang for my buck because the personal size pitcher served about three drinks. Also my cheesecake was delicious and I would defintiely return for this but the food to me in general was a watered down american version of authentic mexican food.

I went there this evening with my boyfriend and it was a seriously the best mexican food I've ever had in NYC!We had to start with the guacamole, made table side! I would have preferred a little more salt (but hey I like salt). As a mid-course the chef brought out bite-sized ceviche on a tortilla, which were quite lovely. Cool, crisp, and a very nice signature of hospitality from Management (and the chef). Thank you.I ordered the Rancheras Vegetable Enchiladas and my boyfriend ordered the Mexico City Street Salad with Barbecued Tuna Loin. They were both quite a hit! My enchiladas, to die for! I think I even got a little crisp from the Chayote Squash (which I love). Nothing worse than overcooked veggies, which unfortunately I have come to expect from Mexican dishes that contain vegetables. Not at Rosa's!The tuna salad was nice! Rare Tuna accompanied with Pineapple, Mango, jicama, and pumpkin seeds. In my opinion a very summer dish. The ambiance was very lively and festive.

2.0,7/8/2011,"We went here because of the all positive Yelping. Before you get too excited about the tableside guacamole, let me at least say that I thought it was disappointing. I mean, they make it in front of you, so you can see how ordinary it is. And for $14, it should come in a bucket or talk to you. It's not that it was bad, but it's no different than what you'd get at Chipotle or what your sister made for last year's Superbowl party. Dinner was good but it's the same story - a few tacos are only worth $20 when there's something special about them, like if they give you night vision or the power to summon the subway at 3 in the morning. Ours were really good - but so are the tacos I get for $2.00 a piece from the truck across the street from my apartment.This is the kind of place I really want to like -- it's swanky but not pretentious, its drinks are strong and our service was great -- so it's sad that I left feeling so disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's an impressive place; definitely good for a first date, and the type of restaurant that will be a hit if you're treating a large party to dinner. Just know what you're getting yourself into: overpriced chain-restaurant Mexican food in a party dress.If you do go, get the cheesecake. Get the cheesecake. Get. The. Cheese. Cake. It is so good.

2.0,6/18/2011,"Today my boyfriend and I went to Rosa Mexicano after reading about their dedicated gluten-free menu because I have celiac. One of the hosts and the waitress were very knowledgeable about the allergy/celiac disease and communicated with the kitchen. They even made us fresh tortilla chips in fresh oil TWICE.The food was tasty, but its not mexican food. I am originally from Texas and my boyfriend is from Southern California so our standards are pretty high. But still, its not mexican food. So that was a bit disappointing. Also, I didn't like the decor/ambiance. It was weird. They were playing weird music and the dinning area was very ""hotel bar."" Nice, but a flimsy facade nonetheless.I couldn't finish my meal (since I had eaten so many chips and salsa!) and asked for my rice and beans and remaining enchilada to be wrapped up to go. The guy took my food away and brought back a box and when I opened it later for dinner he had only put my beans and rice in the box! Not my enchilada! I explicitly asked to have everything put in a togo box. It was really disappointing and also got me thinking about the other things that went wrong during our meal. The decor and vibe, the white-washed version of ""mexican"" food, the bad music, we were never offered drinks (other than water) or shown a drink menu.Although eating out while on a gluten-free diet can be tricky, it is becoming easier to find good gluten-free options.

It was AMAZING.  The waiter was super charming, almost TOO much. Kept giving me googly eyes but it was sweet. It just became annoying when he came to the table every 3 seconds, but I guess he was very attentive so you can't fault him for that. Looks like a great place to chill and have margaritas at night.

We arrived and still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  What's the point of making reservations? No apologies were given, nor was there and explanation.

2.0,4/30/2011,"So...I went here with the BF after attending a mixer where I had two beers, which for me as a lightweight would normally make even a mediocre restaurant relatively praiseworthy. For Rosa Mexicano? Yeah, not so much.We arrived here at 10:30ish on a Friday night and even though the place was only half full our first table offering was between two other yapping tables. Yeah: no thanks. After requesting another table and parking it in a booth we ordered the guacamole (of course), which was good but overly salty (particularly given that the chips were also salted). Still, guac is hard to screw up, so we scarfed that down with little complaint. (munch, munch)When the pitcher of red sangria arrived we were expectantly drooling for non-H2O libation, but the sangria tasted like a big, BAD (not in a good way) sex on the beach: it was all triple sec and peach schnapps with wine- and fruit-based flavors in absentia. YUK. We sent it back. The BF ordered a sparkling sangria replacement for himself (as bad sangria doesn't stimulate my fleeting boozehound interest) and he mentioned liking it even if I thought it was also taste/flavor challenged: no, you can't hide cheap triple sec and peach schnapps with pineapple juice.Anyhoo...We ordered a couple of apps (the market salad and the layered, smoked chicken tortilla pie) and split a salmon dish (salmon filet with tropical fruit mole) and everything was just okay. This surely doesn't say much about the food as, like I mentioned above, most anything (within reason) tastes good when I've got a buzz on. To top things off, the service was pretty inattentive (empty water, waiting on check, etc) and (beyond our ADHD waiter whose energy was busy) seemed generally disinterested and uninteresting from my perspective.Bottom-line: The prices weren't justified by the mediocre food, drinks, and service we received.",0,0,0,Randy S.,"Chicago, IL",25,127,58

I had the steak with mushrooms which was okay, but a little over cooked. The mushroom sauce was good, and the portions were satisfactory. I did not like the yellow rice they brought out, so ended up eating my steak with tortilla chips and the soft shell tacos. All in alll, we had a good time and enjoyed our dinner.

For some reason, this time the service was utterly poor and the food was mediocre at best. First, the tortilla chips were stale! Did i eat them? Yes. I was using them to subdue my hunger pains before the apps came out.I got the Steak & Shrimp combo stew. For $25, you would expect a lot more beef & not have the shrimp be so minuscule. Also ordered the chicken tacos which you would think would be pretty easy to prepare. The chicken was extremely dry and had to use the provided sauces to make it more tolerable. Ordered the Tres Leches for dessert which took what felt like 15 min to come out. Aren't these desserts already prepared and just need to be plated? WTF.I understand working in a place like this can be exhausting, but is it that difficult to come by once for less than 5 seconds to ask how our food was? The waiter did no such thing and still didn't when we paid for the bill which was slightly south of one bennie. This place gets 2 stars because the ceviche & crab turnovers were pretty good and the ambiance was quite nice. Bottom line is don't bother with this place. Go to Dos Caminos instead. The menu is easier to navigate and the food is better overall. Over and out!",0,0,0,Leo L.,"Manhattan, NY",5,18,0
3.0,3/28/2011,"I go to Rosa Mexicano for two reasons: 1) The frozen pomegranate margaritas- they are as delicious as they potent.  I would not recommend having more than 2.  Unlike other frozen margaritas these pack a punch!2)  The guacamole- the guac is prepared tableside which is always fun and I think it's the best fresh guac in the city, even slightly better than Dos Caminos, my favorite mexican place.In my opinion, they have some slightly odd entree selections and nothing that really appeals to me personally so I usually load up on margaritas & guac and order the chicken tortilla soup instead of an entree.  Without a reservation you can pretty much count on a 30-45 min wait at leas, but once seated you will receive mostly attentive service.",0,0,0,Caitlin C.,"New York, NY",81,5,0

3.0,2/23/2011,"This restaurant is a strong 3 stars. Rosa's food rates at a 4 but their lack of personal service and attention gets them a 2.My girlfriend and I came on a Tuesday night, which we still had to make reservations due to how popular this restaurant is. Apparently if you post that your going, at, or went to this place on FB you WILL get jealous responses, It is known for sure. We came due to the fact that my Girlfriend loves Mexican and she'd been to another Rosa and knew there was one in Manhattan, there are three altogether in Manhattan. Note this is the Union Square location. After no wait and being seated in a table already with menus on it waiting for us we waited, and waited, and waited some more.Yep, even though the restaurant was spot on when it came to sitting us down, we were forgotten about when it came time to acknowledge that we would have a server. Finally after 10 minutes a person who was not our server came to take our drink order. We had waited long enough to know what we wanted for our entire meal so we put in an appetizer order of the table side made fresh guacamole and chips and a large pitcher of Sangria.  Our drink taker was not too knowledgeable of what and how it was made, except he could point out wine, brandy, and apples was in it. I wanted to know what Red wine was used in the Red Sangria, a Merlot gives a Sangria a much different taste than a Cabernet Sauvignon. He did not know and so the tone was set for the rest of the evening.When it came 15 minutes later I was disappointed at the amount of ice that was in my apple, fruit juice, red wine, sugar, and brandy concoction. I got a pitcher because I was afraid I would never see my server again and die of thirst or kill my buzz chugging water.On to the food, eventually... Again with the waiting. If I wanted a waiter I'd go to a diner. We finally meet our server, who gives no apology or explanation for having allowed us to wait almost 30 minutes before our order could be taken. Not cool. The Sangria and ""Table-Side"" guac appeared by a mysterious third person that never introduced themselves or explained the food being left. No ""table-side"" guac for sure, as far as I know it came out of a can and the put it in front of us from the kitchen. Again disappointed from the let down from no table side presentation. So far Rosa Mexicano was a really failing.I ordered the Chicken Suiza and my girl got the Carne Asada. The server did not care to ask the desired temperature of the steak. When we met a fourth person who dropped off our food, or did not meet, seeing that again no explanation was given, and the person left.The Chicken Suiza came out on a big plate covered in mole sauce but the chicken tasted boiled, shredded, and flavorless. Maybe the plate was normal sized and it was just the two 3"" by 6"" tortilla wraps that seemed small for an entire entree. The taste was the same with the soft corn wet tortilla shells, bland. The cheese was on one tortilla wrap but not the other, bummer, I love cheese. The fresh ""pico de gallo"" turned out to be raw chopped white onion and cilantro tossed on top in a pile, NOT a good idea. I begrudgingly consumed my bland dish and waited for my girl to offer me a bite of hers and drank the Sangria. I was still waning for the nice tingle of tannins that didn't come till after the pitcher was empty. This place was really starting to suck.Yes, to reiterate, the Sangria was so weak neither I nor my girl felt a buzz till after a total of 4 glasses a piece that's 32 oz each( a big gulps worth if you will). My girls Carne Asada came with a little red circular box of soft tortillas she could wrap the little carne chunks in, nice touch. The chi-wa-wa corn side was amazing, by far the best thing next to the taste of the fresh ""supposedly table-side"" guac. The Carne meat was very moist, soft, and full of steak flavor yumminess. I would stay away from the licorice pinto bean side dish, just strange and not appetizing. Not sure why they would even plate such a weird taste, yes licorice and beans?!A note on service, not once did any of the four different people that came to our table ever check to see that the food or drink was to our liking. Again, big NO NO in my book. At least check to see that the entrees came out correct? The desserts looked and sounded amazing in their descriptions but we passed having already been shut out from the lack of personal service and attention. The bill came swiftly, hah, yeah right it did, I had to flag down another server and have him go get my server who came finally with the bill. Just a note, none of the drinks have prices next to them on the menu so be prepared for a shock on the bill. I still lift a 20% tip knowing everyone has an off day but if I ever have to come back due to my girl loving the atmosphere and guacamole my expectations have lowered to three stars and will be ready for only three star service.",0,2,0,Michael C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",23,37,40

We picked out a few apps on the happy hour menu, including the chicken and pork ""street tacos"" that were great. The guac was alright; we got the mild, and among 5 people sharing this, there was hardly enough to go around.

I recommend their enchiladas as they have proven time and time again to me to be some of their best prepared meals. The sauces are unique enough to differentiate themselves from the typical enchilada styles while still maintaining the Mexican influence.In regards to their drinks - their pomegranate margarita is not to be missed. One of my favorite evenings was when one of my friends and I each did their tequila flight and actually learned quite a bit about tequila from our waiter. Surprisingly we didn't even go on a tequila bender afterwards, but thanks to that night I do have a bottle of Don Julio that I added to my collection.This location in particular is far superior to the other locations in the city (especially compared to the Lincoln square location). The service is excellent and the managers are really on top of their game. So if you don't mind paying $14 for table prepared guac (which they let you choose your level of spiciness) or about $15-25 for an entree you will have a good time at this Rosa Mexicano.",0,0,0,Ben B.,"San Francisco, CA",189,245,16
2.0,11/18/2010,the service is very good however you have to wait in line for 45 mins to get a table. i got the chicken enchiladas and it was SO DRY! it was basically mushed chicken in tortillas with like 2 strands of cheese on top. where's the flavor?!?! i was dissapointed. the chips in the beginning were my favorite part of the dish.that's about it.all i could think about was how i should have gone to chipotle and save myself 20 bucks.,0,0,0,nikki r.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

Not sure how I feel about the large circular tables for groups though; I felt like those across from me were too far away and could barely hear a thing over the noise and the music. I believe the food is way overpriced, but their guacamole is superb and worth it. Drinks are expensive; not too many specials on their menu unfortunately. Also, if you make reservations here and your entire party hasn't shown up on time, expect to wait and sit around because they won't seat you right away unless everyone has shown up. Kind of annoying and wish they'd cater better to those who reserved seats. I'd say the experience here is pretty average for a pricy restaurant. I've had better Mexican at places that were cheaper than this. My feeling is that most of the money you're paying is really for the huge space they're renting out.

3.0,11/13/2010,"Let's be honest.  There is no really good reason to go to this restaurant.  There are many better options around the city in the mexican category.  Also, the place looks like it belongs in Cancun rather than NYC.  Having been to the branch in the UWS, I wasn't expecting quite this level of cheesiness. Only thing keeping this from a 2-star review... is the fact that we had a great time.  And how can you knock a  restaurant when you have a really fun night out? If you are going to dine here, I'd recommend the lump crab enchiladas.  At a 7-person table we had chicken tacos, butterflied snapper, and filet - but I'm pretty sure the crab enchiladas were the best dish.  Don't be scared away by the 3-pepper heat rating next to the dish.  This place is too commercialized to knock people out with true heat.You almost have to have the guacamole.  Just like everything else here it's not the most interesting/authentic preparation in the world, but it's tasty.Throw in a few margaritas and consistent/attentive service and you have the makings of a good night out.",0,0,0,ehsan i.,"New York, NY",0,28,0

The pumpkin seed and bean chili was a nice addition to the make your own pork tacos as well as the creamed corn. Sadly the whole dish lacked taste, but made up for it in texture. The Mexican chicken potpie was festively decorated with a bland green pepper sauce, which sat under the soggy and unseasoned mixture of tortilla and chicken.

4.0,5/31/2010,"I chose this restaurant for a Friday night reunion dinner because of location, scene, gluten free menu, and general appeal of Mexican food and sangria.While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, I asked the hostess about the gluten free menu. She responded by saying they were reprinting an updated version so there was no tangible menu at the moment (though it is online), but my server would understand the issue and could help me navigate the regular menu.  We first headed to the bar area to have a pre-dinner cocktail.  The bartender told me that Sprite has gluten in it so I shouldn't drink the white wine sangria.  I appreciated her concern, but while I know very well that Sprite is gluten free, I decided to hold off until I could confirm with our server (due to a  previous bad experience with sangria made with beer...I'm looking at you Sunset Grill in Allston, MA).When everyone arrived, we were seated promptly and ordered the guacamole.  I could basically live off guacamole so I was relieved that the chips were gluten free.  Our server confirmed that the white wine sangria was also gf, and told me that 90% of the menu was as well.  4/5 of us actually ordered the chicken enchiladas, so yeah, we weren't too daring, but everything was delicious (and safe).  All in all, I was satisfied with the entire experience, though I, like previous reviewers, was a little taken aback that everything is very....bright.  And pink.",0,4,2,Felecia C.,"Boston, MA",49,169,0

2.0,5/27/2010,"The freshly made guacamole was good (though expensive at $14), and I could see this being a convenient and kind of ""neutral"" place to bring a large group of people.  That said, just about everything else  about the restaurant was ""so - so"" to ""meh"".  The decor was kind of interesting and very pink, but something about it kept reminding me that I was in a chain restaurant, which put me off. We got two appetizers, two drinks, two meals and a dessert, and the only thing that stands out is that one of the appetizers (the pulled pork, I think) had a distinctly gooey texture.  I like spicy food, but using strong flavors takes a certain finesse. In this case, all subtlety was lost, and the flavors of lime and chili in the sauces overwhelmed while the meat / fish seemed to lack flavor completely.  When I encounter such elaborate and strong flavored sauces along with such bland meat, it makes me think that they are just pre-preparing mass quantities of the sauces and then just warming up the meat assembly-line style. And I'm sorry to report that while I was really excited about their ""famous"" margaritas, I found the  them quite weak and much too sugary (though I tend to like all of my drinks on the less sweet side).  Again, I can easily imagine a giant vat of pre-prepared margarita in the back, not something I would expect at $14 a drink.  And now that I think about it, not putting lime in the guacamole strikes me as a cheap cost cutting maneuver, which kind of rankles me given the price. It is upsetting that my main recollections of this place have to do with how they seemed to be cutting corners while trying to present as an upscale establishment. I have had much higher quality Mexican food at much lower prices (and frankly, in much more charming places).   Overall, I would not go back; I thought it was overpriced for nothing special.",2,0,0,Ren K.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

Someone who is hard of hearing would have a very rough time here. We had a reservation, which I recommend. There was a line of hungry people waiting to get in when we left. They really push the guacamole made tableside, ,but it really seems like a ripoff. The guac is fine, but what makes it good is just the fresh ingredients; go get yourself some good avocados, garlic, lime, cilantro and sour cream, and you can make it just as well. I found it annoying that, other than the margaritas, there were no prices on the drink menu! I ordered a red sangria, which came in a small pitcher for $11. It was tasty. We were there for my daughter's 14th birthday. She got a carne asada enchilada, and my wife got the lump crab enchilada, which came in a really good green sauce. I ordered the day's special, a lamb enchilada that was fantastic, with a nice tangy red guajillo chile sauce.For dessert, we opted for another special of the day, chocolate-chipotle cake.

2.0,4/14/2010,"I really wanted to like this place. I had a $150 certificate to spend with 4 people. So the meal was pretty much free.. kinda. The wait wasn't as long as I thought for a Thursday night and I was able to park right at front (digital meter parking). I do recommend reservations, if you must come here. The prices weren't bad. If you don't order alcohol then you can get away with $25 per person including appetizer(s). I had $150 of certificate cash, so I ended up spending $50 per person.While we were waiting we had La Rumba. It's their take on the mojito which was good, we liked the taste of the cilantro (I'm going to steal that idea when I make it at home). Damn tho..... $14 a piece, plus of course the $2 the bartender over chargers you.... cause ya know ....They are greedy bartenders, so it ended up being $16 a piece at the bar, but magically $14 at our table. The meals aren't over priced like that or taste as good as the drinks for that matter.I started the table with guacamole which is made table side, which is pretty cool. It's your average guac. I also ordered the rolled crispy chicken tacos and the duck tortilla pie. The chicken tacos were actually the best thing we had all night, but that doesn't mean it was great or anything. Just average. The duck tortilla lacked flavor in the duck. Which I think is the main problem with their dishes. All the flavor is from their sauce and the meat is incredibly bland, sometimes just not cooked right (I'm talking to your roasted chicken... you tasted and looked like tuna). We also ordered the lamb enchilada, chicken tacos al asador, and the chicken enchiladas. Like I said before the chicken in all the dishes sucked completely and so did the lamb.Three things I have to note was the service was excellent and incredibly fast. I think everything we ordered came in, in about 7 minute or so. Which makes me wonder if they have some of this meat slopped in giant metal bowls back there. Third, the dessert was pretty good. My sister and her man ordered the ice cream. I had the Cafe de something which had kaluha in it. Tasty and a good way to end your meal. I recommend ordering one of their cafe's as dessert, if you really must come here.The plating was pretty and the decor was very modern, but don't let that fool you. The food is mediocre. Maybe that's the problem. I think most people eat with their eyes. The way they put their food/dessert together is sexy. But the food sucked.. I'm sorry. Now that I think about it, I take it back. I didn't like the sauces. The mole I had was too sweet for my taste and the green sauce they had on the chicken enchiladas was too. When I go back to South Florida, I may give you another shot.

4.0,3/19/2010,"Had a great time for drinks and dinner here last Friday night. We were a thirsty party of 4, looking to have a relaxing dinner. We told the waiter we wanted to sit and enjoy a round of drinks before ordering and he was very accommodating to our leisurely pace. We never felt rushed and we certainly took our time. We started with a round of the house specialty, Frozen Pomegranate Margarita. Yum but one was enough, too sweet to drink all night. With the second round of drinks we also ordered guacamole. The server recommended two orders since we were 4 people including two big guys. We got one medium and one spicy. The spicy was a good amount of kick and that's what I would get again next time. My second drink was La Clasica, a delicious margarita on the rocks. My sister got a sangria and LOVED it. Round three - ding ding ding. Now we're getting a little toasty, man those drinks are strong. Next up I ordered the Buena Vida which was my favorite drink of the night. So Refreshing!! At this point we placed our dinner order as well. I ordered one of the specials that night, a shredded beef enchilada with a white pine nut sauce. It was delicious. The beef was tasty and tender and the sauce was mild lending a pleasant flavor to the dish. The favorite at the table was my uncle's short rib - so good! And a very large portion this would be good to share. The only failure was my other uncle's rack of lamb. He said it was bland and boring. At this point we're stuffed and drunk. Man those drinks are strong. I had been on a water break for a while when we decided to do a flight of tequila before heading off for the night. Dessert is for wussies.

Ok I lack both rhythm and originality but the decor at Mexicana Rosa is so frightening it will make you dance or interleave current hit songs with Mexican dishes.  We didn't have a booking and they don't take them over the phone but the place is really large and we were seated promptly. We started off with some guacamole which was made right near the table by the mobile guacamole man. We opted for spicy but sadly the chilli overshadowed the soft gentle nature of the avocado. From a man with his own guacamole stand I expected more, the tortillas weren't freshly made.For starters we shared some crab empanadas and a pulled duck dish. The empanadas were wonderful, crisp little pillows filled with soft sweet crab, they came with a side of green tomato sauce , A+ all round. For my main I had the steak tacos which were good but by this stage I was pretty full, a little drunk and was unable to finish the plate, strange man. All of the mains were large in size and meat centric, herbivores beware.We were downing frozen pomegranate margheritas, I am more of a shaken margherita man but these were good.  I have no idea how much the bill was, we certainly didn't hold back, the starters were between $10 and $15 and the mains between $20 and $25.",0,1,0,Izac H.,"New York, NY",48,84,6

Yes, ONLY the guacamole. It is the best guac you can get in New York City. Melt in your mouth fantastic!Once you order it, they bring you a basket of warm, crunchy chips with two different kinds of salsa. The salsas have a kick to them, so addicting. And once you have that on the table, someone makes the guac right in front of your eyes. That's as fresh as you can get! The avocados are stacked right on the cart! You see them cut them open and scoop it into a bowl. All fresh ingredients go into this dish. My goodness, it's the best guac I have ever had. After they place the bowl in front of you, not only do they give you the right amount of chips to ratio the guac, they add on some warm tortilla in a basket. So yummy in my tummy. As for the food. I order enchiladas, things with tortillas, and even tried the fajitas. Everything is just mildly okay. Nothing fantastic. And the price you pay is not even worth it. So I would skip the meal.

That would have been fast if we told them we were in a rush.  Apps came really quickly, but were taken away before we could finish because the entrees were already there.  It was so quick that it was almost a little unsettling.  I definitely felt uncomfortable and unwelcome - except for the tip we would leave.  And the gratuity was helpfully pre-calculated on the receipt...on the post-tax amount with the biggest boldest font on the receipt.  I don't mind leaving large gratuities, but something about it at this place just struck a chord with me.

And don't get me wrong, I love the Cheesecake Factory but the prices here are definitely not Cheesecake friendly with $20 enchiladas and entrées averaging $25, appetizers around $15. Their drink menu is a bit confusing...that is if you're trying to find out how much drinks cost. I think my margarita was $12 and it was in a tiny highball glass ... but apparently the tequila is higher quality? Whatever it is, I just know after our 7-person meal I ended up shelling out $80 for half an enchilada, some guacamole and three drinks. As many other reviewers mentioned, the guacamole is delish...very similar to the Dos Caminos version and handmade at your table. The chicken enchilada was a bit bland for my taste and after filling up on guac there was little incentive to finish. The duck appetizer was also a bit bland..could have used some of that jalapeño jelly from He Who Shall Not Be Named.

We start with the frozen pomegranate margaritas and I am happy. Not so much alcohol that I can't get down to business and ask what's on my mind, but the right amount that the flavor balances and I don't feel like someone ripped me off again because they were skeptical of my age. Trust me, even when you have the proper identification the bartender can and will still judgment call you and put less alcohol or none if they think you aren't of age. Which I am. But I don't look like it. I order the carnitas tacos because I don't know any better but to order pork everywhere I go. I could never be kosher. They are excellently spicy and I am surprised. Chain Mexican restaurants always get the spices on these things wrong. They're always water down forms of the original recipe. But this wasn't. Nice change. I'm going to guess Efron wasn't in charge of making the tacos. Last, but not least was dessert. I sensed that neither my friend nor I really wanted dessert after cramming down all those tacos, but after Zac explained the special, there was really no turning back.

The space is special. Almost as tall as it is wide, the vibe is cool, the mood happy - drenched in pastel lights and a wall of Acapulco cliff divers. The pomegranate frozen Margarita is an excellent signature drink and the bar has significant space for groups to congregate and hang. At $11 a pop they aren't cheap but not a terrible deal either. On this evening however we were dining so those drinks were coming straight to our table. For dinner my choices were the chicken flautas served with queso and a a smoky hot chipotile sauce and a main course of pork shank (an enormous piece of meat thank melted off the bone) over chirizo infused red beans, rice, etc. The tastes were fabulous and the plates were served nice and hot. Service was swift, friendly and my wife's request for grilled serrano peppers with her entree was happily fulfilled (at no cost). We decided against the table side guac. namely because the appetizers are better and we wanted room for our entrees. Also, the salsas served with the chips are all one needs. So, a solid 4/5 for this trip and the knowledge that there is consistency in the service one has at this location. With that said, I know there is an undercurrent of disdain for Rosa Mexicano. Some complain that it's not ""authentic"" while others say ""why spend this much on Mexican food."" I'm not going to argue the points other than to say that the menu at Rosa offers a wide range of choices that escalate her ""style"" of cooking to a very high plain. Ingredients, seasoning and technique that are associated with new Mexican cooking are employed in a very fresh and flavorful way. There isn't a dish that feels ""heavy"" or over-cheesed/-sauced/-seasoned. It remains my go-to for upscale Mexican (Maya being the runner-up).",0,0,0,Andy G.,"Austin, TX",20,103,0

2.0,9/11/2009,"Expensive.  Overrated.  The food is not what I would call quintessential ""Mexican,"" but it's only decent because it's in New York City (I'd like to see how many other options for Mexican food exist here).  I was more impressed with the guacamole than with my entree, which tasted rubbery and was rather flavorless.  As for the guac, a guy comes right to your table and makes it in front of you... It is fresh and the spice level is customized.  If you come here, go for the guac and get a drink... and get dinner elsewhere.  It's just not all that good.  When you're from southern California like I am, the idea of this restaurant is a joke.  Gourmet Mexican?  Whatever...",1,0,1,Leigh M.,"Cedar City, UT",12,261,1
3.0,9/5/2009,"Why was this place so hyped up?  Yes, the guacamole was good but it wasn't even made tableside.  The rest of the meal was so-so.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria but definitely was watered down.  We had a variety of dishes and weirdly they all came out within 10-15 minutes of ordering.  So, that made me suspicious that the food wasn't made fresh to order and not surprisingly, it didn't taste as fresh as it could've been.I gave it 3 stars because the environment is nice and guacamole was good but besides that, i won't be making another trip out here.",0,0,0,Julie Y.,"New York, NY",140,322,2
4.0,9/4/2009,"3.5 stars (Yelp REALLY needs to allow half stars, I really had a tough time picking a 3 or 4)...Great place to take a date if you're in the mood for Mexican food and want a classy place to go. The space is gigantic, beautifully decorated, and immaculately clean. If you like guacamole, they wheel a cart to your table and make it fresh in front of you in a traditional stone mortar and pestle. They don't make the best Mexican food or margaritas I've had but they aren't bad either and if atmosphere is the most important then you can't get a nicer place to eat a burrito than Rosa Mexicano. I was a tad disappointed that they serve beans are a puree and not whole as a side with the enchiladas and other dishes. The prices match the atmosphere so expect to pay more than you're ever used to paying for traditional Mexican food.",0,0,0,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",785,2205,1856

We got to sit in the back indoor garden area on a sunny day- it was great! The only reason I gave it three stars is because it is not at all vegetarian friendly, and since both my mom and I were veg, we literally had one option to choose from (which ended up being nothing too tasty). The waiter/kitchen were not very accommodating either, saying that the kitchen could not make anything else vegetarian for us...which is surprising at a Mexican restaurant... Where are the beans?!

5.0,7/8/2009,"I love Rosa Mexicana! Not only is the setting/ambiance/decoration wonderful, but the food is fantastic!We came on a Sunday mid-afternoon, looking for a chill place to get our grub on and Rosa Mexicana happened to be across the street, and boy am I glad it was!The interior wall as soon as you walk in is grand, it's got high ceilings and is completely open, with a waterfall wall with mini diving sculpturines cascading down from the high celing separating the ""dining area"" from the bar area. It's so neat to see, very aesthetically appealing. From the front dining area, you can see the sun drenched back dining hall, where we sat, and it was great! So colorful with these neat seatbelt woven chairs, and large fanning leave bushes (haha! don't know the actual name of these leaves) and the since it's all window sky-light ceiling, the sun came through and it was really really lovely eating, drinking and basking in the sun.On to the food.  If you go, you MUST have the freshly ground guacomole, it's an experience to see, and to taste. They have differing levels of heat, we got hot, but it wasn't too bad. (but I like spicey) so maybe mild will be the way to go for those less intense eaters.Coupled with the tortilla chips, it was fantastic!I ordered a Pomegranate Martini frozen- it was delicious, but I don't think it's fresh made. They also gave it to me in a mini tumbler, which was kind of weird, but it was tastey.For grub, I ordered the chicken enchilada which was smothered in the most amazing mole poblano sauce. For those of you that don't know what Mole Poblano sauce is...Wikipedia states ""Mole PoblanoMole poblano, whose name comes from the Mexican state of Puebla, is a popular sauce in Mexican cuisine and is the mole that most people in the U.S. think of when they think of mole. Mole poblano is prepared with dried chili peppers (commonly ancho, pasilla, mulato and chipotle), ground nuts and/or seeds (almonds, indigenous peanuts, and/or sesame seeds), spices, Mexican chocolate (cacao ground with sugar and cinnamon and occasionally nuts), salt, and a variety of other ingredients including charred avocado leaves, onions, and garlic. Dried seasonings such as ground oregano are also used. In order to provide a rich thickness to the sauce, bread crumbs or crackers are added to the mix.""

3.0,7/1/2009,"Considering that I'm Latin and I've tried a variety of Mexican foods, I must say that this place is mediocre. To start I had the really addicting and delicious guac. I loved the fact that they prepared it right in front of you but it mimics my fave place (dos caminos). There is nothing that is really unique about this place but would come back for the white sangria and the guac. Lost a star bc they didn't let us finish the guac and they were really f-ing rude and just took it way. smh... For my entree I had the tortilla pie but the cheese and the green sauce is too overwhelming, but the inside is sooo delish! Corn and chicken it was really good.

Went here for lunch yesterday and it was the first time I had actually stepped foot in the establishment. Very cool and trendy space. We sat in the atrium-esque area and started off with the guac. Made fresh and tableside, it was delicious. They even brought us some mini tortillas to make some mini guac tacos, mmm... I ordered the Budin de Pollo, which was quite a tasty dish. I even managed to stop myself at full instead of over indulging and having to be rolled out and back to the office. I can also speak from experience that the Enchiladas Suizas are delicious.

Actually, it makes you feel like you're in Miami. The waterfall wall in the middle of the resturant and the glittery bar are very eye-catching. But if you want to get away from the hub-bub of the main area, asked to be seated towards the back--much more relazing, with a huge airy ceiling. I don't know if it's just me or Mexican food in general but like Dos Caminos, this restaurant excelled in the Guacamole & chips & the fruitydrinks. Everything else was just ok.

If you're looking for cheap cocktails, don't come here. If you like trendy and have money to spend then this place is pretty good. The pomegranate martinis are fantastic. Had I taken a breath after my first one I would have realized it was so strong that I didn't really need the second. Not before dinner, at least. The guacamole, as everyone before me stated, is fresh and super tasty. I come here for this reason alone. Pour me a cocktail and give me some chips and dip and I'm a happy girl. I had a real meal here once (chicken enchiladas) and they were good but forgettable. Had it not been for the guacamole and martini I probably would have forgotten ""that place where I had those enchiladas"" pretty quickly.

We had a couple of drinks at the bar, and then dinner. I am a beef lover and i ordered from the Platillos Principales, the Tablones and MANNNNNNNNN - they were the bomb.

And how good can guacamole get? Avocado already has its own unique taste, whatever you mix it with- it'll taste great. I ordered the rack of lamb. By rack, it was only 5 small lamb on bone portions grilled with asparagus and a pumpkin tamal on the side. The taste was good but only because it was grilled, everyone loves the taste of GRILLL. For the price ($28), I expected something spectacular. My boyfriend ordered the tablones which was boneless beef short ribs with peppers - To me, it was just  dry pulled pork.

Like many of the other reviews, I must agree that the decor is just an experience on it's own. The blue centerpiece mini-waterfall, the avocado green doors and the modern rectangular sinks in the bathroom were great. The friendly staff and the atmosphere was a comfortable experience.Now onto the food and drinks. We decided to go with appetizers and a pitcher of sangria to start. Let me just say that if you intend to order 3 or more sangria drinks it is definitely more economical to do the pitcher - we confirmed this with our waitress, who was very accommodating and serviced us very well. The guacamole and chips is a definite must orderl, reason being is they have someone make it there for you with the avocados.The Empanadas de Jaiba aka Crab turnovers were very tasty, 4 mini crescants on a plate that were gone in about 2 minutes. We also had some rolled chicken tacos as well, but those weren't spectacular or anything.All in all, it was an enjoyable time - bill came out a bit high due to 3 pitchers of sangria (yes it was hard to stop).

Rosa Mexicano boasts a large dining room that is somehow always full with a line at the door. The food is pretty good but the guacamole is a MUST. The desserts were also very tactfully prepared and better than I expected. The wait staff is truly friendly except for one incident where the hostess was less than accommodating. My friends and I decided to initiate an impromptu dinner at Rosa when we encountered a situation that was not only vexing but inhospitable.  After being told by the hostess that we would be seated within 45 minutes, we were later told again that we would have to wait another hour after ALREADY waiting for 45. I was outraged and left. If I didn't miss the taste of the savory Guacamole then I would have never gone back.

It was last minute and we had no reservations but they had what I'll call emergency seating, in the front quarter, adjacent to a half wall of what looked like cut pvc pipes. (I'm into geometry and painted white it gave us a riddle to figure out) The wall was also used to separate us from those with reservations who we peeped at in their lovely cushiony booths versus our miniature tables. That said, the walls were breathtaking. Dynamic blue with loads of small glass angels. I kept staring.Service was fantastic, our waitress was attentive without interfering. But I have to say it-the food was fine but not mind blowing and for the price, all I could truly point to as fantastic was los guacamoles.

4.0,12/8/2008,"I liked this restaurant and thought the food was very good - not 5 stars worth, but good (I'd give it a 4.5). Hubby and I were visiting NYC last month on a short holiday and one night wanted to do dinner somewhere within walking distance of our hotel. And we felt like Mexican. So off to Rosa Mexicano we went. We started with margaritas (of course). Hubby had the Classic and I had the Unica (their Cadillac margarita). Smooth and tasty, so I ordered another (and later a 3rd). Then we had the guacamole they make tableside. It was good and, of course, very fresh, but I thought it could have used a bit more lime juice. For dinner we both had tacos. He had the cabrito and I had the carne asada. I really like the presentation of the food in the cast iron skillets with the sides in their own bowls. And if I remember correctly, there were also black beans and rice brought to the table in large bowls for family-style service. There was way too much food, but it was good. I've noticed in some reviews where people have complained about the food being overpriced for Mexican food. I really don't get that comment. Mexican food comes in many forms and in different levels of quality just as 'American' food does. And there are both dive and upscale Mexican restaurants just like ""American' restaurants. This restaurant falls in the more upscale range. Anyway, I thought the food and the atmosphere were both good. The waterfall cascading down the wall in the middle of the room is gorgeous.

But putting that aside, the service is friendly and the food is delicious, particularly the table-side guacamole. I've been to this location (and the Lincoln Center one) several times, and have had to wait to sit each time, even with a reservation - not a problem. The atmosphere of the whole place is fun and colorful without being tacky or over-the-top. Just go to the bar and have one of the signature pomegranate margaritas. They are delicious and strong. So pace yourself. They go down very easily. The food is quite good. The enchiladas tend to be heavy on the sauce, which I don't particularly care for, but everything else is really good and flavorful. Make sure to order guacamole, which is usually made tableside and comes with chips and yummy warm tortillas. You could probably make an entire meal out of it.

4.0,7/29/2008,"One of the absolute best upscale Mexican restaurants that I have visited anywhere in the U.S. Every time I've gone to Rosa Mexicano I can't help but get the same main course that I've gotten since my first visit. And that says a LOT as I get bored fairly quickly and usually live to mix things up. The stellar dish I'm talking about is the ""Pato en Salsa de Zarzamoras"", a roasted duck dish that's accompanied by mashed sweet potatoes mildly spiced with chile de arbol, and a delicious blackberry chipotle sauce, along with some perfectly grilled asparagus for good measure. It's a beautiful dish to look at, but even better to devour.Luckily I always end up going to Rosa Mexicano with at least one person that orders the Filete con Hongos, which is very unexpected to anyone used to the more Tex-Mex variety of Mexican food. This is a lovely serving of filet mignon that comes with a creamy mushroom and tequila sauce. The best appetizers I've tried are the crab empanadas that have large chunks of crabmeat stuffed inside nice-sized fried patties and they come with 2 dipping sauces, one pico de gallo and one with tomatillo-avocado. They seem to always bring rice and black beans on the side for the table.I highly recommend this place for a special occasion, or even just for an occasional splurge.

I read the mixed reviews on this place, but I decided to give it a shot. The guacamole was amazing, dessert was good, my date was great,  but the food was very avg. I think this place might deserve a 4 star by others, but since I have very high standards for Mexican food, this did not do anything for me.

5.0,6/10/2008,"Don't let the fact that this place is an ""upscale chain restaurant"" throw you off. While yes, pricey, the food you'll get here is worth every dollar you'll spend. Our waitress was down to earth and was willing to work with the natural silliness that my dining companion and I exude when we eat out.We started out with a few margaritas -- we had the frozen pomegranate and a normal one on the rocks. Both were excellent and generous on the alc. content. They put the ""arga"" back in margaritas.If you go here you can't be too cheap to order the guacamole special. Otherwise there is no point and you might as well be eating at Don Pablo's or some dumb place like that. Anyway, this nice guy comes out with a huge basket of nice 'n ripe avocados and he grinds them up in this awesome stone bowl that looks like it comes straight from the set of the Brady Bunch Hawaiian Adventure Special.The taco special main courses that we got looked small but were more than filling and completely adequate for a dinner portion. The refried black beans that came with are a cheesy glob of immaculate goodness. It should be noted that I have a sensitive stomach, and while standard Mexican fare can upset my plumbing, Rosa Mexicano went down smooth and I was stomach-trouble free.We had the cheesecake for desert which was just yummy in every way that a cheesecake should be. Highly recommended.PRO TIP: Make sure you grab some of the free matches from the bowl on the way out.

I always heard good things about this place, maybe I need to get my hearing checked. I had the filet mignon, cooked to medium rare. But the outside was quite burnt when I got it. They use a pretty good tasting mushroom sauce to cover the burnt, so you can only taste it, not actually see it. Their tres leche isn't up to par w/ other restaurants either. Just get the fresh guac and stay away from their filet mignon. The ambiance is really cool with part of their restaurant design like a Spanish Villa, so go there for a view, enjoy a beer or wine w/ the guac, and then go on over to another restaurant for a better entree.",1,1,1,Jack N.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,352,129

I've been to Dos Caminos many times and I have to say that Rosa is superior as far as upscale Mexican goes. (and the decor is much cooler.)We didn't have a reservation but they managed to find a table for two on a Sunday at 6 pm extremely quickly. The service is top notch, the staff is very attentive and genuinely friendly. Your glass will not go empty and the food arrives in just the right amount of time. We had the Empanadas de Jaiba, Queso Fundido and the Enchiladas Mole de Xico. All were delicious - the Queso was awesome... but I'd be hard pressed to have anything bad to say about a hot pot of melted cheese and chorizo. The cheese gets all crusty on the sides of the pot... mmm. So good! The empanadas were stuffed with crabmeat and accompanied by two interesting dipping sauces. The Enchiladas Mole were awesome as well. The portion is extremely generous, two nice sized enchiladas and good sized bowls of rice and beans on the side. The mole sauce was delicious - had the right amount of spice/heat to flavor. I will defintely eat at Rosa again in the future.

4.0,2/1/2008,"I prefer Dos Caminos.. hmm did I write a review for that one?? Well first things first: Rosa Mexicano. I LOVE the decor of this Union Sq. location- it's so much fun!! Came here several times for drinks and most recently lunch. Of course I ordered their famous pomengranite margarita, and I wasn't like head over heels but towards the end, I was like.. okay.. so it does its job. I feel like Rosa Mexicano has more tacos, enchiladas (basically anything with a large topping of their refried beans) vs. Dos Caminos and its wide selection of seafood and entrees. None the less, Rosa Mexicano serves some knock out entrees. I particularly enjoyed my Salmon en Manchamenteles. It's grilled organic salmon (best medium rare) served on top of mashed vegetable mixture of zucchini and roasted corn (that gives it a smoky kick). The sauce that sits on the bottom is a combination of chiles and fruits, pureed perfectly to compliment the fish. It's a tasty blend of spicy, smoky and the right amount of sweetness. Plus it's topped with grilled pineapple (YUM). I love mexican seafood dishes and this is one of my favorites! If you're intereste in dessert, definetely go for the Tres Marias Sundae- it's fantastic. You get to sample their popular ice cream and sorbets ith roasted fruits.

Our group had reservations for 8 pm - on a weeknight the place was teeming with people (okay, so it's NY and we get that), but what made it worse was that the hosts were pathetic about getting patrons out and making room for folks waiting. When we finally sat down after about an hour of waiting, the menu was totally unappetizing for me. Our host recommended I try the chiles, which I agreed to, but got me a fancy enchilada instead - being famished and ready to get out, I didn't bother to argue. The cocktails were bad, the table side guac was probably the best thing that night and the ambiance while very trendy was a poor substitute for bad food and bad service.There's plenty of other great places in the city that serve up upscale Mexican in a comparable setting, and on future trips I intend to return to my familiar spots - Rosa Mexicano is a strong skip-it as far as I am concerned.",1,0,1,D J.,"Chicago, IL",19,277,0

2.0,6/8/2007,"I'd like to wax poetic about a simpler time when Starbucks had not taken over the universe, Dunkin Donuts did NOT have the best coffee, the East Village was edgy, and there was only one Rosa Mexicano in the city (on the UES) and it was the only place that made guac at your table and the food was good, the vibe was warm...Clearly those days are gone. And in the space formerly occupied by the atrocity known as ""America"", has arisen another Rosa. The first time I went, the Rockwell interior struck me as interesting in a too- intellectual-for-me way, but now it just looks like a Mattel toy truck collided with a flatbed loaded with Christmas lights and the whole thing skidded into a 12 piece mariachi band in the middle of Las Vegas. (How's that for a visual?)The service, while friendly, was man-handled by the kitchen. The appetizers came with the main courses, though my soup never came at all. And the coffee never came after or with dessert until we begged. The food is the traditional Rosa fare and isn't bad, but it just isn't great. Perhaps it is my memory, which is fading, but UES Rosa was so much better back in the day.",4,4,7,Courtney P.,"New York, NY",105,220,4

2.0,4/19/2007,"I'm a big fan of Mexican food and Rosa Mexicano seemed like it could offer a creative and high quality spin on traditional dishes. Instead, it was just a disappointing restaurant experience. From beginning to end the service and interaction with staff was impersonal and inattentive. I practically had to throw a napkin at the bartender to get his attention while waiting for our table to open up. This wait amounted to about 20 minutes and that is despite having had a reservation.Finally seated, we were treated to watching our guacamole made right in front of us. While very cool it mostly served to give us an appreciation of how over-priced the just okay and uncreative guacamole was. The tiny and, ultimately, useless taco shells had their mysterious function explained to us by the waitress. Who would've thought that you could use them to make, wait for it... tacos?The main thing Rosa Mexicano had going for it was that all of the ingredients seemed to be top notch and fresh. Unfortunately, this was difficult to identify underneath the excessive amount of salt that plagued everything but the guacamole. Each piece of beef, each bean, grain of rice and drop of sauce was infused with salt and not much else. Although the portions were sizable, they were dominated by rice and beans.Overall, the decor is attractive but the random separators made of cross sections of PVC piping are an eye sore and don't make any sense with the dim lighting, the high ceilings, nor the large fountain wall. Also, it was really loud for no discernible reason. I don't plan on returning to Rosa Mexicano and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1,1,1,Kenny L.,"Astoria, NY",7,91,0

We put in our names, picked up our buzzer/stungun/tazer, and went to the bar, where we barely squeezed in between the suits and the suits' girlfriends, and ordered a couple appetizers.  The food came up quickly and we inhaled it, probably bc we were starving, but I do remember the quesadilla being very tasty and possibly filled with mushrooms?We were promised a 45 minute wait, tops, and after 1 hour and some sure-to-have-been-annoying-hanging-around-the-hostess-station, we were finally seated (I guess it was our fault, we were walk-ins).  We indulged in some guacamole (not the best in the world, but combine it with the habanero salsa to give it some heat and flavor - even the ""spicy"" guacamole was pretty weak), and then all proceeded to order variations on tacos (I got pork, she got chicken, he got steak).The tacos were served fajita-style, as in build your own. They were good but nothing spectacular.  The best part was the sheer volume.  I ate a lot and became very very full.  I don't think any of us finished our entrees.But hey - you get to mingle with big guys in suits and they make guac at your table and serve you big ass portions of Mexican food.  Totally awesome!",0,0,0,Jason O.,"Albany, CA",31,75,0

Fresh guacamole is made right in front of your table (they got a guacamole cart, pushed around thru the tables). Entree was delicious, not too much and not too little, just enough after a few margaritas and guac. the good part was, i went there with 8 people and we only waited for 45 min (on a friday night) when everywhere else in the area is a 1.5 hr + wait.",3,0,1,Josiah L.,"New York, NY",71,155,35

4.0,8/12/2006,"It may be a Mexican restaurant now, but this space will always be ""America"" to me!  But as the 80's are long gone, it's appropriate to serve a more worldly cuisine for today's more sophisticated palates. The first time I dined at Rosa Mexicano in this location, I was shocked by how modern it was compared to the one that I was used to on the Upper East Side.  Occupying the former space of ""America"" restaurant, this is as close as you can get to Mexican food and a Scene combined.  It's got a fairly young crowd, as well as some business group diners, but the place is gargantuan so it can really host any type of event.  The acoustics have always been challenging in this space, so I'm not sure if it would be my first pick for a romantic date, as it gets REALLY loud.  The margaritas flowing constantly add to the decibel level as people get their happy on. Reservations are a must, but be prepared to wait nonetheless.  If you can snag it, the front waiting area down the stairs from the bar is less crowded than the bar and great for people-watching.  Order a frozen pomegranate margarita, and rest those stilettos for a while. The food is a mix of homestyle cooking and upscale twists on traditional Mexican dishes.  Guacamole is a staple here, made fresh at your table, and offered in mild, medium or spicy.  Go for the spicy as they are all pretty mild - and if you like it really spicy, order chopped jalapenos on the side.  Another great starter is the chorizo & cheese - and for a REAL treat, order some flour tortillas, add 1 part guac and 1 part chorizo/cheeze, and devour.  Mmmmmm. Dinners are elegant and well-presented.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the duck breast, which was served rare in diagonal slices, on a bed of pureed sweet potato, garnished with blackberries and a blackberry mole sauce.  Excellent.  I have also had the pork shoulder, which is delicious, and the fish specials are always tasty. As we were here for a birthday celebration, we brought a cake - and be warned that this is not a cheap endeavor.  After purchasing the cake, you must also pay $5.00 PER PERSON to have it plated and served.  WITH YOUR OWN CAKE.  So if you have 10 people, that's an extra $50 that didn't contribute to your buzz.  Suggest that you stick with their desserts, or have your cake elsewhere.  The upside to this event was that we gave the rest of our delicious cake to the NYFD across the street, and they were grateful for the treat. The service is good, although I have had the same server a couple of times and she seems marginally pissed off, whether it's a party of two or ten.  However, everything is served in a timely manner and efficiently cleared, so no complaints - don't need a warm fuzzy with my meal. Good drinks, good food, good times.  Rosa Mexicano is a fun & reliable choice for a festive night out.",1,0,1,Liz S.,"Portland, OR",719,1061,884
4.0,8/9/2006,"I had the pleasure of going to the newest Manhattan location of famed restaurant Rosa Mexicano. It's located on 18th Street in the building where the restaurant America used to be.  When I walked into the place, I was overwhelmed by how spacious it felt. The two story high ceilings and the use of partial walls really helped to open up the dining area. And a fun wall fountain (decorated with hundreds of little statues of diving men) separates the raised bar area from the rest of the restaurant.  Last night I was with a large group, so we ended up having to wait over an hour for a table (surprising for a Tuesday night, but this place was hopping). We made good use of the wait time by having some of the famous pomegranate margaritas ($10 each, and they are some of the cheaper drinks at this establishment). I always have salt with my margarita! The drinks were so tasty and quite strong. We also ordered a round of chips and guacamole while we waited. There are some nice banquettes up by the bar, so we were all able to sit down to drink and eat.  We finally got seated around 9pm, and I think we overwhelmed our waiter a bit. We ordered a ton of food....a few of each appetizer (the Chicken Flautas were my personal favorite) and we ended up sharing a bunch of entres as well. We had duck and shrimp and beer, there were chicken enchiladas and lamb shanks and really there was just so much food! And all of it was delicious!  The service at the table was a little slow (we understood it would take awhile for the food to come, but it took 30 minutes for 5 Coronas to show up, and that was after asking for them three times).  I think this would be a fun place to go with a small group of friends.

The crab filled emapanadas with two salsas were not bad either. Those aside, the other dishes are passable - a little dry even - particularly the fish (the rice, snapper and seared tuna were dry and the sea bass was flavorless).  While the tableside-made guacamole was good, it lacked salt and was not quite as good as the addictive version at Dos Caminos.
