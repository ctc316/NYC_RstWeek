5.0,4/14/2019,"Bring France to New York as I am unable to travel to France.  A French Bistro in New York summons dinner for one as life is too short but to make the most of this fabulous but fleeting time.  This intimate French bistro reminisce of my past splendid visit to Paris, France.Steak Frites $3810 oz. prime bavette, Pommes frites with Béarnaise sauceI am truly enamored of this French entree.  This entree is very well prepared as it was cut in pieces in its authentic French form and cooked well without being dry.  Burnt edges for the meat but it has no effect on the quality or taste as it was not dry.  The Pommes frites were abundant overflowing the plate.  The Béarnaise sauce provided was a nice light compliment paired with the meat.  I was able to eat my fill.Château Cambon, Gamay (Brouilly, France 2016) $16Suggested by my server for food pairing with my steak which is very light served chilled, medium body and smooth finish.  I actually enjoyed this red wine.Vanilla Crème Brûlée $8This dessert was too heavy and very thick vanilla cream which I did not enjoy.  I was unable to finish the plate.  The organic cane burnt sugar coating was average.Ambiance is intimate with dim lighting, light French background music conducive for conversation and good for couples to take dates.  There is one long couch against the wall.  I am enamored with the mirror walls and wall paneling.  Outdoor seating is available with weather permitting, but I always prefer indoor to fully experience the atmosphere of a restaurant as I do not want to see vehicles passing the street blowing dirty wind in my food nor hear boisterously loud vehicles' horns blaring.  My server Neysen is attentive, efficient and professional with a smile as she was not dismissive nor pushy nor ushering me to quickly finish my meal.  Prior to my meal I received a complimentary warm pastry puff as a small appetizer which was enticing.  Business cards and post cards are available for grabs.  Bistro Leo is accessible by C local train at Spring Street station.Nota Bene: This business is dba ""Sessanta"" which appears on your bank's credit or debit card statement.",19,8,16,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",2001,4196,9889
5.0,3/26/2019,"TLDR: Great for unique cocktails and appetizers! Overall rating: A+Came here tonight for a quick drink before a show at HERE Theater nearby. It's truly excellent and I'm already looking forward to coming back. We got the last of the fall/winter cocktails menu. Fausto, the head mixologist here, was really great! You can tell he's really passionate about creating the perfect unique and delicious drinks. He was friendly and chatted about cocktails with us for a while. I was impressed with the dozen bitters they had!-JEAN JUSTE PISCO SOUR (pisco, lime, fig syrup, banyuls, anisette, egg white, garnished with a lavender sprig) $17: This was one of the best pisco sours I've had! It was made with real egg whites! It tasted of berries. It was complex and not sweet. I LOVED it! It was $17 but worth it. Looking forward to trying the strawberry based version (starting this week). A++-FALL LEAVES (scotch, bumbu, drambuie, date syrup, green chartreuse, peychauds bitters) $17: My friend's cocktail was oddly too sweet. Great if you like to taste the alcohol in your drinks. I prefer to not taste my alcohol. B--WARM BAGUETTE (grass fed herbed butter, sea salt) $4: They make great mini baguettes here. I appreciated the herbed butter was soft and spreadable. A++ Can't wait to return for the seasonally changing cocktail menus! Also love their charcuterie platter but I wasn't super hungry. The entrees were ok, but not mind blowing from my previous visit. I'll just stick to snacks and drinks here!",1,0,1,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,143,27
2.0,2/12/2019,The decor was beautiful but the ambience did not feel like a french bistro AT ALL. Music was crappy radio pop and the food was mediocre. It just felt..... lazy. The Service was great but to be honest I most likely will never be back.,0,0,0,Rose M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",176,3,0
5.0,2/4/2019,"I came here for the Sunday lunch during restaurant week. I do appreciate how they offer restaurant week on Sunday as many other places do not.I had mussels as the appetizer and they were great. They were in a creamy but light buttery sauce and the portion was generous.For the entree, I had the steak frites. Honestly, the steak was not as huge of a portion size as I had seen on yelp or it definitely looked better in the pictures, yet once I started eating it I was pleasantly surprised by how filling it was. The fries were perfect. I liked the béarnaise sauce (sort of tasted like hollandaise) that came with it as well. As a dessert, (not included for lunch's restaurant week), we tried the prickly pear sorbet and the crême brûlée. The crême brûlée was some well except I was a little disappointed there were no fruits on top. The prickly pear sorbet was very rich in flavor. I recommend it for a sweet yet tangy choice. Overall, I think the food was 4 stars but the service was amazing (definitely five stars) and I just loved the ambiance. We were seated on comfortable couches, the mirrors, and blue/green textured wallpaper, made it a charming atmosphere. We stayed and relaxed as we ate our meal for 3 from 12 noon until 3 pm.",2,0,3,Tina S.,"New York, NY",112,197,226
2.0,2/2/2019,"Didn't have the same experience as other fellow rw attendees. I came here for winter rw2019 and the appetizer was the star of the show. The mussels were savory with sides of toasted baguettes. No sandy mussels. We were given an empty plate to our mussels when were done. Trying to tell them to take our plates away, but was given a plate to put the empty mussel shells. What for? Obviously we were done. Took another server nearly 20 min to remove our empty mussel plates and to serve us our entree. As for the entree, the steak frites was quite dry even though a medium and medium rare was ordered.  The fries were salty and stringy. Service was not attentive as soon as our appetizers were served. Our server was more attentive and friendly to the table next to us. Tried to get attention of the drink server and it was the same. The decor of this place was definitely the second star of this review. Very cute and romantic with hints of euro vibes. Nonetheless, I will give this place another chance if the service improved.",1,0,0,Jenny T.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,1,0
5.0,1/27/2019,"Restaurant week was on point here! They do Sunday brunch which was ideal for us and I booked for 2pm and they seated us 20mins early as we arrived early. They also accommodated my seating prefs to have it separated from other joining tables for more ease of access and comfortability. I had the mussels which were good with the sauce. Without the sauce the mussels were just steamed to cook. Sauce had white onions in them, butter and other things I wasn't sure of (but it tasted good!). Steak frites was recommended as medium rare (which is still my ideal steak level) and the glass of red was sharp and was good to pair with. Our server was super friendly.Ambience wise we were seated under the skylight which was very nice and there was even a comfortable pillow to lean on while eating for better back support.",0,0,0,Yan H.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,19,10

5.0,1/26/2019,"My girlfriend and I found Bistrot Leo on the list of Restaurant week locations. We decided to try it out and made a reservation on our 1 year anniversary. It could not have been a better choice! I had noted it was our anniversary on the reservation and the entire staff was so thoughtful about it. They brought us rose and gruyere cream puffs (on the House). They were polite and attentive. A+ service! We had the Pâté and Mushroom soup, Salmon and Coq is Vin as entrees, and both deserts. Everything was delicious, but the Coq au VIN was the standout winner. Thanks BL we will be back again soon!",0,0,0,Wylie B.,"New York, NY",172,3,0
5.0,1/24/2019,This place is gorgeous and the vibe is on point! I attended a private Hennessy/ dining experience last night and had a phenomenal time. The cheese selection is fabulous. The breads are so fresh and soft- just as you would expect at a French spot. We had a short rib and vegetable dinner. It was cooked and flavored to perfection. The bathrooms are IG worthy. I will definitely be coming back soon to try the cocktail list and full menu.,0,0,0,Jen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1001,218,6

5.0,1/21/2019,"I noticed Bistrot Leo while I was getting Cronuts around the corner. Checking on the NYC restaurant week menu, Bistrot Leo is a participant so I made a reservation. I am craving Steak Frites! Then my wife calls and asked me to change the date, not knowing it pushed me out of NYC restaurant week. which means no Steak Frites for me. Sad face. Not to worry, we had an incredible brunch that I can't wait to tell y'all!Walking in, Bistrot Leo is a cute as hell French Bistro. There is French music playing, there are French wines being poured and there's French food being prepared. Oooh la la! Our waiter? Towards the end of our meal, He put us on the low priority list which pisses me off. The food kept the fifth Yelp star.My wife & I sit down after coming out of the cold. We ordered two hot coffees. After looking at the brunch menu, we both know what we want. My wife ordered an omelet & I ordered the Croque Monsieur. Once we warmed up, now I want to experience Bistrot Leo. We ordered some outrageous French wines and a Charcuterie plate. The Charcuterie plate? Wow! They had a chicken liver pate with organic butter that was so decadent, I would have been happy with just this item. The Jamon ham and grain mustard was wonderful with the crusty baguette. My Croque Monsieur and side salad was perfect, a classic French meal. My wife's meal? The eggs whites were fluffy and creamy from the cheese, this was a cheff'd up dish that had my wife swooning. The potatoes were another masterpiece. Creamy in the middle and textured and crunchy on the exterior, the total dish was heavenly. While my wife and I are enjoying our meal, our waiter is MIA. The restaurant is empty and I see him up front. I nod him over and ask him for coffee refills, more cream and more bread for the charcuterie. He takes our plates and silverware, he says he'll bring back clean items. He never comes back and I took everything we needed from the next table. I nod for check and we said our goodbyes. Au revoir Bistrot Leo. I will be back for French Restaurant week, I want to try the Steak Frites!If you're looking for a nice French bistro that's fun and has great yummy comfort entrees? Bistrot Leo is an excellent choice.",11,9,8,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",601,2493,5315
4.0,11/26/2018,"Very tasty French restaurant. I love the wine selection & water service. my cup always had water so you never have to ask for refills. Overall the food and service was great. I order the chicken thigh with the brown sauce and the chicken texture was amazing, the waiter told us it's people favorite and I could taste why. Also the carrots with the white creamy sauce was delish. I was on a diet so I was happy to find tasteful food w/ no carb options.",0,0,0,Stefania M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,34,40

3.0,8/21/2018,"Went for restaurant week so we were able to get a decent deal in terms of price, but it still felt overpriced for the mediocre quality. Fries were good.  Steak had some grizzle.

4.0,8/17/2018,Love the ambience. Felt like I was dropped into a cute French film. The roast chicken with mushrooms was delicious. The waitress seemed a bit slow but maybe they were just understaffed that day. Good overall!,0,0,0,H K.,"Warwick, NY",200,30,0
5.0,8/15/2018,"Bistros Leo is very French and very fine dining with serious chef cred. I've been twice for restaurant week. First time with girlfriends was a mixed bag, second time it was perfection. Lovely interior and French tunes take you far away, and of course the food...Ate:CrevetteBranzinoLemon tarteCabernet francOddly I had the crevette and Branzino twice. the raw crevette with horseradish and avocado mouse is simplicity defined. The Branzino on the second visit was perfected with eggplant mousse and perfectly seared eggplant and perfectly seared Branzino and the poured veggie pesto. The lemon tart was also super delish.

5.0,7/13/2018,"Came here for French Restaurant Week. We sat outside on a lovely summer evening and all felt perfect! Most noticeable was the delicate touch of each and every dish, from the chicken liver pate, escargot, to the entrées of branzino and prawn risotto, they all had a refreshing taste. I find French bistro food usually very rich. This place does it differently in a good way.Wait staff is patient and friendly.Had a great time!",1,0,0,Nean S.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,19,3
4.0,7/1/2018,"Overall very enjoyable meal and great service.  Many seemingly classic or traditional-sounding items on the menu, yet everything is prepared in a very delicate way.We started with the pork rillons and potato mille feuille, which were both terrific.  The pork rillons are first cooked sous vide and then flash fried, so you get a crispy bite before getting into very tender cubes of pork belly.  The potato mille feuille was equally impressive, if not more so, with paper-thin layers of potato.  It was fun to try the three different sauces that came with it, but I would've been happy just playing with the potato layers alone -- do I eat a big cross section bite, should I try to peel back and count the layers and eat them individually, or do I go somewhere in the middle?The highlight of the entrees was definitely the grilled long rib, which was fall-off-the-bone-no-knife-required tender.  It was packed with flavor and delicious, but certainly on the heavier considering both the richness of the cut of meat and the preparation/sauce.We also tried the Atlantic wild cod, which was the weakest link for me.  I was expecting a whole filet of fish, but it was actually chopped up pieces of the cod on top of a bed of the white bean puree.  It wasn't bad, but perhaps just too different from what I was expecting (and hard to shine next to the long rib).Would love to come back another time to try more items!",3,0,0,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",76,383,987

3.0,5/8/2018,"Look, I am not trying to be the wet blanket here. I like the location and the outdoor-y seating. But when it comes to the food, it is just plain, mediocre, for lack of better words. Usually, my philosophy is, if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing. But when I saw the high rating for this place, the responsible self of me felt I have to say something..Let's start with the positive. Service, location, the weather and the perfect encounter (of course, not part of the restaurant but a function of the location). Wine list is not the best, but decent selection and approachable. The need-some-work part: food.   I had the lobster nicoise salad decorated with green beans oeuf farcis aka mayonnaise egg and fingerling potatoes. It was refreshing , tho nothing special to write about :/ The lobster was marinated thoroughly - too sour; and it was about 6 oz lobster while you can get a lb for the same money at Citerella. Sure, I admitted i came here just for the outdoor table and people watching in SoH. And that is what I will likely be doing in foreseeable future.

4.0,4/28/2018,"I enjoyed it for the most part. I found the reception at the door a little snooty, but this affectation is unfortunately common with lots of expensive restaurants in NYC, and you can't take it personally. I prefer the kind of warmth and engagement I found at the bar with Eduardo, their bartender, who was happy to talk about the in-house made ingredients for one of their signature cocktails. The menu is interesting with some familiar bistro favorites and some interesting surprises. Personally I enjoyed the cod and my wife's salmon. Desserts were wonderful. Table service was cordial and efficient. Prices were about what you'd expect, about $100 per person with gratuity for three courses and mid-priced wine by the glass. I would probably return.",1,0,0,Neal W.,"New York, NY",59,130,0
4.0,4/21/2018,"Good place. We tried it in its first week and my only complaints would be front of house and some service hiccups which i'm sure will get worked out quickly. They have lovely seating outside if you can get it but inside is also very nice, especially the back rooms. We sampled half the menu and everything was good. I recommend giving it a try and welcome it to the neighborhood.",0,0,0,P C.,"New York, NY",6,142,11
5.0,4/20/2018,"Visited opening week last Thursday.  So glad we did.  Perfect menu.   Nice renovation and the banquette seating at the booth  tables are so comfortable.  It ws early so my friend and I employed our normal strategy of ordering all the great apps with cocktails. Started with the foie gras, steak tartare a dozen oysters and something I am forgetting.  All of these dishes were perfectly done and tasty..After some more cocktails we ordered a steak fried and the lobster nicoise to share, which were more great choices. Our waitress and the rest of the service crew were all on the top of their game, also very friendly and made us feel welcome and comfortable.   The decor is different than Sessantta had been ,but it was tastefully updated for this new Sogo bistro.   I'm certain thst this spot will be popular soon.",7,2,3,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,260,371
5.0,4/6/2018,"John McDonald's Italian spot Sessanta has now changed to Bistrot Leo, serving a great menu of classic French fare.The decor doesn't seem to have changed much, which is a good thing because it's a beautiful restaurant.Definitely start with the Potato Mille Feuille ($13), three pieces of really delicious crispy, buttery layered potatoes. The pommes frites are also perfect, which makes the Steak Frites ($38) an excellent option for an entree. The Atlantic Wild Cod ($32) was another great choice for something lighter.For dessert, get the Banana Pan Perdu ($12). I'd definitely come back to try the giant rib for two since my wife didn't want it tonight.",7,3,6,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
