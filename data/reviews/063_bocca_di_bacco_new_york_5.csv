4.0,4/23/2019,"If you like Italian foods as me and you should give a try this restaurant. I wasn't know which Italian restaurant was good in this area for delivery but I glad that I tried this restaurant. Food(3.5/5)-I ordered Spaghetti con Langostini, steamed broccoli for the first time also ordered Branzino Grigliato, Cozze e Vongole, Rigatoni alla Norcia for the second time. Spaghetti con Langostini was good and their Langostini was fresh and big. Steamed broccoli was nothing special but they gave me service of chocolate cookie(it was amazing good tasted) with some bread. Bread was cold and I didn't enjoyed eat but foods were still hot when they delivered to me. This place pasta was little hard but theses days I like eat hard pasta than before cuz in my opinion it taste better also you can taste of sauce very well if pasta noodle is harder than soft. Branzino Grigliato was smaller than I expected. I personally thought it cost expensive than food quality. Vongole was good but not the best, I had been eat better elsewhere in NY. Vogloe is my one of favorite dish so I could tell you that this place vogloe was good but don't expect too much. I strongly recommend you should have try Rigatoni alla Norcia here. Sauce was fully flavorful. I've eaten many of pink sauce but I could tell you this place pink sauce was top list. My friend was choosing my pasta and I really thankful to my friend for Norcia. Service(4/5)-Even you order foods here for delivery, it was hot and nice delivery service. They delivery packing service was amazing. They made sure my food was hot and didn't licked. Bit I only wish they'd give me warm breads instead of cold bread. It would better if they didn't give me breads.",1,0,1,Jae H.,"New York, NY",25,292,1253

I don't remember the waiters names, but every person who waited on us was so nice and very attentive. There was a pasta dish I wanted that was only on their brunch menu, but they still made it for me anyways. I had the Kinktini (something like that lol) really good!! The mussels were also amazing! We ordered 3 different pasta dishes- everything was so good! I also asked them if they could make a special dessert platter for my sister and they did it perfectly! Wish I remembered the waiters name and the others who waited on us too, thank you for the great service!

2.0,3/31/2019,"So - my meal was great - and our waiter was very capable and accommodating. However - my dining partner's meal was a nightmare. For dietary needs, he ordered the gluten free pasta. When it came out, it was so undercooked you couldn't even get a fork through it. Our waiter immediately asked if everything was ok, and of course, we sent the meal back. It took them over 35 minutes to replace the meal. I was done with my meal before his ever even showed up. The waiter kindly bought him a glass of wine while he waited. He kept us updated on the progress (or lack thereof) on the (very simple) pasta throughout. Even when the meal finally showed up, the pasta was still undercooked (what was happening for 35 minutes?!?) but edible.

Ordered the calamari appetizer, which came with fried zucchini. It wasn't bad - about average. Don't think I would order it again.

Later in the night when we asked for a wine suggestion, she was annoyed. she said whatever you like when we asked for white wine, she did not care. The waitress never checked on our table she checked on other tables but not ours.  Then she came and complained about her tip claiming all customers tip her 20% she asked us why we did not tip her a higher amount. when we explained why we were dissatisfied with the service. She said I have been a waitress for 20 years and was very defensive. Worst service ever I will never eat here again.The manager did not help all he did was shake our hand and tell us to come again.

3.0,1/25/2019,"My colleagues and I came here for lunch. We ordered from their Restaurant Week menu. Overall this place is decent. It's not too busy during lunch time. The food was pretty good. Crab cake, spaghetti, and tiramisu were all delicious. We were all happy about the food I got. I would recommend octopus on the menu. It looks amazing. $26 for 3 courses was a amazing deal. Usually it's for two courses. There is vegetarian option on the menu, which is great. The service was subpar. Even though the restaurant was not busy, we stood at the door for 5 minutes to get someone to sit us. Then we sat for another 15 minutes to get the waiter to take orders. Lunch took us almost two hours. Waiters were not very friendly either. But the bottom line is, they did their job.",0,0,0,Mike S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,128,202

5.0,12/22/2018,"I was the first Yelper to write a review about Bocca Di Bacco in 2012, this is now a much needed update. I said I hope this place picks up? It was packed on Friday night! I have theatre tickets and we need to secure dinner reservations. Carmines? WAS ON FIRE YESTERDAY, Not to fear, I know Bocca Di Bacco was a solid choice. My sister in law was craving Spaghetti with bolognese sauce, I knew Bocca Di Bacco has it down along with their freshly made pasta. My wife ordered a calamari (Its not pronounced GALAMAD) starter as well as a board with some beautiful looking crostinis. The cal-A-Mari (It's easy to say, don't embarrass yourself) has baby octopus as well as fried zucchini chips. Soooo good!I read the menu, my go to meal is a big plate of Fusilli. Add Italian Hot & Sweet sausage in a cream sauce, now we're talkin' baby. Mmm mm!My niece wanted carbonara which wasn't on the menu. Uncle Billy, I can they make it for me when we go? Our waiter said not a problem sir. Everyone is happy, great food in a very hip setting.I look over to my sister in law with bolognese sauce on her chin. She's in the zone.

5.0,12/9/2018,"I have visited this restaurant for dinner. We did not have a reservation; however, they were able to seat us swiftly. The bread with the tomatoes that they bring to the table were pretty good--I asked for extra tomato dip. For an appetizer we ordered the calamari which everyone loved. The calamari also comes with fried zucchini chips, which are pretty tasty with the tomato sauce also. I ordered the spinach tortellini and added mushrooms, and devoured the entire plate. A few my friends got the squid ink pasta and loved it and the other two got gnocchi and they also loved it.

4.0,12/8/2018,Had our reserved table when we arrived a little early. It was in the back by the kitchen which I wasn't thrilled with at first but with two kids (9 & 11) it turned out to be best. More room and quieter. Had the cured meat appetizer which was fantastic. Fresh bread with bruschetta was very good. Kids split meat sauce dish - tasted a little sour. Other dishes included minestrone soup - very good. Caesar with massive amounts of cheese - just meh. Pork chop and veggies was excellent. But let me talk about the best parts. Service. Service.

My husband ordered the stead med-rare and it was well done...even charred to some degree. Then he ordered a double espresso and got a single.

4.0,7/10/2018,"Some friends came in from out of town and I met them for dinner prior to their seeing Kinky Boots later on that evening. They like the restaurant scene along 9th Avenue and wanted to eat at Bocca di Bacco. We walked in and were seated immediately. Water arrived at the table and my friend and I both got a glass of wine; she opted for a rose, I got a glass of Merlot. Italian bread arrived shortly after with EVOO. We looked over the menu and the both of them opted for soup and salad. They both ordered the zuppa di fava-a creamy fava bean soup with spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese. They both ordered the bresaola e pere salad made with arugula, imported bresaola, [like a prosciutto] bosc pears parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar. I opted out of soup and salad and ordered the orecchiette in salsa di ragu d'agnello-the small ear, hat shaped pasta with lamb ragu sauce. Our meals were delicious. Two of us ordered espresso and the third got a cup of cafe americano. We were full and did not each want a dessert but ordered biscotti to share among the three of us. They too were excellent.

4.0,6/11/2018,"For months I've wanted to try this place for dinner but when wondering where to go for brunch my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out. Every Sunday, this Bocca Di Bacco location* has a boozy brunch from 12:00 - 4:00pm and offers a pretty solid deal: $5 for Mimosas, Bloody Mary's or Screw Drivers or $20 per bottle of champagne or $20 for a pitcher of the aforementioned drinks. Walking in, I'd say around 12:30p or so, it was incredibly quiet! It was actually so empty, I gingerly approached the hostess asking whether they were actually open. When she confirmed that they were, she escorted us towards the back where we sat at our table. The overall ambience is pretty intimate and the interior very rustic and romantic. However, when the ""soulful house"" music being spun by the DJ come on this place immediately becomes more cool and laid back. Enjoying the music and ability to hear one another, our waiter brought over some water and menus. There was a lot to choose from under the usual egg category but there were some panini and pasta options as well. While contemplating food, they brought out some biscuits and cubes of butter and globs of strawberry jam. It was a welcomed change from the typical bread and butter other restaurants might have offered up.We first settled on a pitcher of mimosa, which was about 3 glasses each saving us $10 had we decided to order individual glasses for $5 each. The money we saved ended up going towards our appetizer: calamari with a surprise guest appearance from zucchini (served with a side of the usual tomato sauce). It was really crispy and well done! Our mains consisted of one four cheese omelet with Swiss, Fontina, Mozzarella and Cheddar and the Frittata e Peperonata (eggs with sweet peppers, onions and mozzarella). Each main comes with home fries and greens however I substituted my home fries for two pieces of toast. The eggs were exploding with cheese and when I created an egg sandwich for myself it really hit the spot! My boyfriend enjoyed his main as well but would say it was good, not great.As time went by, the venue became much more crowded and fairly loud - though we could still hear each other properly. The crowd was primarily smaller groups of people who are likely at an age where having low key Friday nights are ideal and wine and cheese instead of chips and gauc are preferred. Kidding. Well, not really. The point of my saying this is that it's a very tame, low key crowd. In fact, Bocca seems to be fairly laid back themselves as there were two tables across from us reserved for someone who had just graduated. A woman was setting up those trendy Mylar helium letter balloons and decorated the tables as she saw fit (i.e. flowers, photo booth type décor with little photos propped up). It was nice to see that Bocca would let their guest(s) have full creative control. Overall, this is a pretty decent place and I would be happy to come back!*There are three locations: the Theatre District, Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea",2,1,0,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2187
3.0,5/20/2018,"We stumbled upon this chic looking restaurant as we were walking along 9th ave, looking for an Italian restaurant. Good thing about Italian restaurants is that they usually have good vegetarian options and almost something for everyone. We started off with the cocktails and two appetizers - flatbread and mussels. The broth in the mussels was great and the mussels themselves were fresh. Flatbread for me was nothing special, it was a bit mush and way too loaded for my liking. Cocktails were tremendous and a hit overall. For the main course, we got a lamb shank, angus steak and tortellini. All items were ok but lacked attention to detail, as the lamb shank was over seasoned and the tortellini was undercooked. Going past that, we wanted to end our meal with something sweet, so we ordered a creme brûlée and the tiramisu -  both of which were home runs and helped us end our evening on a high note.This place has all the right ingredients to be amazing but needs focus to make the parts that are not so good be wonderful.",0,0,0,Jasmeet A.,"Secaucus, NJ",23,66,111

5.0,4/29/2018,"I wish this place was in my hometown.  I'd be a regular.  So me and my travel companion came here one evening after a long day of sightseeing.  We tried going to another place before ending up here, but that other place doesn't tell you they use open table for reservations, so we figured they didn't use it.  Well, honestly, I'm glad they couldn't accommodate us, because we wouldn't have found this place!So this place is small, and it gets loud inside.  It's a tad dark, but the ambiance is sultry and intimate.  Our server was fun and boisterous, and made our evening very enjoyable.We started off with some mussels and meatballs as appetizers, as well as some wine.  The mussels were enthusiastically devoured by my companion who commented that they were the best he's ever had.  The meatballs foreshadowed the rest of the meal for me.  Usually, Italian restaurant meatballs aren't like my Nana's.  They are usually like a kitchen sponge.  These however, were just as good, if not, do I dare say, better, than my grandmothers.  Meaty, juicy, and the gravy that they poured over it just made a great meatball into a world class meatball.For entrees I had the gnocchi and my companion had the squid ink linguine.  They were incredible.  The gnocchi was soft and light, and the pomodoro and mozzarella cheese it was smothered in was incredible.  The linguine had a good amount of seafood, and my companion cleaned his plate.While we were both pretty full, we had to get dessert.  We split the chocolate cake.  It was nice and warm, served with gelato and a homemade raspberry sauce.  It was wonderful.  I only wish we hadn't shared it because I could have easily brought myself to eat the entire thing.So, I'm a big fan.  I'll be back.  This is one of my favorite Italian places now in Manhattan.",2,0,1,Mark D.,"Boston, MA",4,98,58

I was wrong I guess looks can be deceiving this placed filled up quickly. This is a perfect place for a family gathering or date night very intimate. They have a great wine selection fellas if it's date night you can't go wrong trust me. I started off with the bruschetta fungi it was so tasty, left me wanting to order another one but again this place is kinda pricey. Once my meal arrived I was impressed it was so authentic I felt like I was in Italy  no lie. The ingredients were so fresh all of my meal was good.

The house-made pasta was delicious, the serving sizes were perfect, and the sauce was well flavored. Some of the calamari was a little chewier than ideal, but most was perfect. We had a calamari appetizer was delicious. My partner had a basic pasta with bolognese sauce which had him suggesting a return the next day.

4.0,11/7/2017,"--Review for Il Bastardo brunch-- (Il bastardo is renovating their primary location but still holding its brunch in the meantime at this location) 59$ entree with personal bottle of champagne,rose champagne,Bellini or Mimosa (comes out to about 75$ after tax and tip) I have never been to the original Il bastardo brunch and this was my first time at Bocca, the location was pretty trendy and cosy looking and they sat my party of 19 at the back corner of the restaurant (perfect for the surprise party we were doing.) Our reservation was for 1:30pm but our table was ready for us we sat down at 12:45 --because we are good friends and wanted to all be on time before the birthday boy arrived so we wouldn't spoil the surprise--. (We ran into an issue with the host because apparently they did not have our reservation but we let them know we made the reservation with the Il bastardo brunch) Once the birthday boy arrived we ordered our personal bottles-I opted for the rose champagne which was totally yummy. The mimosa tasted a bit too sweet for me. The menu was a bit more limited than I preferred.I decided on the Gnocchi but they told me they did not have it...so I opted for the smoked salmon Benedict. About 45 minutes later our food came. Everyone LOVED their food especially the steak and eggs was a big hit with my party. I was a little disappointed with my eggs Benedict (slightly cold and over cooked--no 'yolk porn') The DJ was nestled in a corner of the bar with his equipment resting on glass shelf--really trying to make the best of this location and give the brunch goers the clubby experience that we wanted. Personally, at first we all were annoyed by how loud the music was when we arrived sober since we couldn't talk to each other, but after our personal bottles we did not mind screaming and dancing to every song. Overall a fun afternoon and a great time and the ultimate party brunch. Come with an open mind and get ready to get tipsy!",3,0,0,Liz G.,"Mount Vernon, NY",135,136,211

I got the avocado toast and I almost broke my teeth on the actual toast - hard as a rock. 3 people at my table got the burger and had to return it TWICE: 1) they ordered their burgers medium rare and it came out well done and super dry AND 2) what they ordered was not what they received.

He responded by saying that there was only one other table available which seats a party of 20.  That table was NOT reserved and was never used while we were there. My second problem with this place is that on their website they advertise brunch as ""PRIX-FIXE $59"" nowhere in their website do they state that tax and a mandatory 20% tip isn't included.  Moreover, when I called to make the reservation I asked for the price and was told $59.  not once did they mention that tax and tip was not included in that price. Lastly, at 4:00p.m on the dot the music was cut off and we were basically kicked out of the restaurant.

Mind you I advised them that she is also allergic to fruits. Then they had the audacity to tell us they weren't billing us for the cut slices. They almost made my best friend have an allergic reaction and end up in the hospital! I'm so completely disappointed. The hostess was absolutely terrible.

4.0,9/18/2017,"I came here for a birthday brunch on a Saturday at noon and it was a good experience. It is a sister restaurant to Il Bastardo. They had a dj and they had a prefix menu for $59 per person. It included a bottle of rose champagne, champagne, mimosa or peach bellini. I ordered the peach bellini and the steak and eggs. It was very good and they gave big portions. The food was quick and the peach bellini bottle was so amazing. The dj was good and played a mix of music. The only little complaint I have is that you are kind of forced to get the prefixed menu and cant order just an entree. My friend didn't want to drink but she was kind of forced to because it $59 with or without alcohol. However, it was a very upbeat place with nice staff.

The server claimed that a certain amount in cash was given to her, when she made one of the guests in the party recount, she said ""oh I'm sorry you were right"", after which she wanted to run ANOTHER full charge on the credit cards. I know that that the first ""hold authorization"" would have fallen off but probably after a week. What irritated us the most was the insubordination of the servers and the lack of ownership from the manager.

1.0,6/26/2017,"Worst brunch experience EVER. Came here for Sunday brunch with friends, and will never return. This place gets 3 strikes for bad service, bad food, and bad music.First things first: the service. We got into a debate with the waiter who said that everything was prix fixe. We didn't want that and wanted to get individual portions. Usually, other restaurants call over the manager and the manager helps work out an exception. Instead of this simple chat with a manager, the hostess (of all people) agreeing to allow us to get individual portions after we said we'd rather eat somewhere else. After that, the waiter was extremely rude to our table for the remainder of the meal. He didn't even complete simple requests for more ketchup, and I had to ask 3 different people for more ketchup before I finally got it. Which brings me to the food. I got a burger because I wanted a hearty and simple meal. The beef was overcooked to a rubbery well done (though I had requested medium), and everything else, like the bun, tomatoes, and lettuce, were really bland. So I hoped the fries would at least save the meal, but also no. They were the saltiest fries I have ever eaten. I literally had to scrape the salt off of every single fry for it to taste normal. Not a fun activity since, I'd rather just be eating the food, not cleaning it.And finally, the music. Oh my god, the music. Everyone appreciates a bit of music in the background while you enjoy good Sunday brunch conversation topics like what you did over the weekend, and what to do in the afternoon. They had a dj in charge of the music, and his song choice made us feel like we were at a high school dance. But the biggest problem was that it was so freaking LOUD. You could only hear the person next to you. The person 2 seats down or across the table? Forget about it. When we left, we had ringing in our ears. If the service had been nice, I wouldn't have been as harsh. If the food was great, I'd give props to the chef. If the music had been pleasant, at least our experience could have been better. But by the time we were leaving, I had never been happier in my life to leave a restaurant.Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs, and go somewhere else.

2.0,3/4/2017,"I have mixed reviews about BDB. I have been here on several occasions. Some food in their menu have good flavors, the food presentation is artistic and the wine list is big BUT, to my every visit, they are served by a mediocre staff. This time around, as if it was getting worse, not only that waiter kept coming back every 30 seconds asking for orders (I was uncomfortably pressured to make a quick choice in span of 3 minutes) but they also turned the music so loud as if the place was a disco techno club. It was clearly appreciated by the 4 customers at the bar and one of them, I suspect, is a friend of the bartender.  When we asked why is the music  so loud? They said they turn it up at the end of night. To drive late diners out? Mind you that was 9pm.Clearly the staff knew zero about hospitality or have heard of the word *CLASS*... considering this is a rather pricey establishment.I ordered a salmon and the medium was served well done and the onion jam was like a ""caramelized caramel"" yes it was that sweet!

4.0,3/3/2017,Originally I had other plans for my birthday dinner but due to unforeseen circumstances we had to switch locations and I happened upon this restaurant. It was one of the few places that took a same day reservation for the amount of people we had. I'm glad we found it though because the food and service was great. We shared the arancini and the mushroom bruschetta which were both delicious. I then had the fusilli with sweet and hot Italian sausage and it was delicious! Then for dessert they brought out a special ice cream dessert and we also had some delicious panna cotta. Delicious! The only reason it's not getting a 5 is because we had to wait for our table but really other than that it was delicious!,0,0,0,Gina S.,"New York, NY",9,14,10
4.0,2/11/2017,"I walked in here with a friend at exactly 3:02pm on a Saturday. The place had a few full tables here and there but definitely not packed. We were immediately greeted by a man who (in a slightly annoyed voice) said ""We're not serving brunch anymore and we don't serve lunch at all."" Ok, well hello to you too, kind sir.  My friend who was as confused as I was said that we had a reservation. At this point, (without saying anything) he started walking toward a table. We followed him and hoped he wasn't planning on killing us. Thankfully, he just brought us to our table and gave us some menus. Whew, am I right?! No idea what the hell that was about.....My friend ordered a mojito ($15) and the chicken entree ($24) which came with potatoes and broccoli. I ordered the Mista salad (14?), which came with almonds and Granny Smith apples. I added some steak to my salad as well. When the drink and food arrived, I was a little confused to see that the waiter gave me a dish that I did not order. I saw a steak with a small handful of greens on the side. Last I heard, a salad with toppings is not the same as a steak and lettuce. Since I am not one to make a fuss, I didn't say anything. They'll figure it out once they read the review, I always say. The good news is that the food was really yummy. Not only was it yummy, it was filling, hot, flavorful and not too expensive. The salad I ordered was about $14 and I assumed I would pay around $12-15 for a small amount of steak. Instead I paid $30 for a large steak and some leaves. For this area, it's hard to find good food at a reasonable price, so I was satisfied with the price I paid. All in all, a good meal.

2.0,10/22/2016,"WORST MANAGER AWARDWhile the food and the wait staff/hostess was exceptional... the manager (bald guy with tacky goatee) was not. NEVER have I ever had a manager asked me to hurry up my dinner because there are more reservations to be sat. The hostess told us they were fully booked, but could accommodate us with a table for four. This was very nice of her to do. The orders for both appetizers and entrees had been placed, with requested holds on entrees for a few minutes separate from appetizers (if possible). ""no problem,"" the waiter said. About half way through the appetizer, the manager came over to our table (did not introduce himself) requested that we hurry up with our meal because they had a full restaurant of reservations. We were shocked and speechless, because never anywhere in NYC or anywhere else in the world, had a manager asked us to hurry through our meal, especially when we had NO MEAL in front of us to hurry through. Just a little slice of Bruschetta. After getting furious with him that no manager should ask a guest to hurry, because you never know how much money they could spend, we look over and see he has made the hostess cry because he put all the blame on her instead of acknowledging he handled the situation poorly. We walked over to the hostess to calm her and say she has not done anything wrong. Can you imagine trying to eat in an environment where the manager has made everyone uncomfortable?In the end, this restaurants manager thought it be a better idea to upset two parties, both mine and the supposed reservation who had to wait 10 extra minutes... instead of just one.NEVER have I heard of this.

Plus I got Tuna tartare and grilled salmon with carmelized onions!!! Omigod. I could not finish. My friend had the octopus and the Branzino and it was also a giant portion. To our surprise the server gave us a half glass of wine as we departed for no reason. Second time we came here and the restaurant was empty and we came for lunch and had almost the same thing. We started with the carpaccio di Manzo and the fried calamari which were both humongous. The cute little waiter was so nice he gave us a free dessert and a free glass of wine AGAIN!!! I am so impressed by the service and consideration they have for their guests that are repeat customers. Third time I came here was for brunch and it did not disappoint the French toast and the egg white omelette were impeccable and large enough to share and they also still gave us an extra Mimosa as we were leaving. great homey wonderful service.

If you are a seafood junkie, you will love this place. The food comes out fast and the presentation is great. My favorites are the grilled octopus appetizer (Polipo Grigliato), beets salad (Insalata Barbabietole Rosse), brussles sprouts side, salmon (Salmone Bocca Di Bacco), branzino (Branzino Grigliato), and chicken (Pollo Al Rosmarino). The sides that come with the entrees are amazing too - mashed potato with the chicken and broccoli rabe with the salmon. If I had to pick the best dish here, it would be the grilled octopus. I think the only other place (similar price point) that matches up to the one served at this restaurant is Dafni's Greek Tavern. This one is saucier than its Greek counterpart, which is charred but super tender!Their desert menu is awesome too - the panna cotta. YUM!

(This explains, in part, the 5 star rating).Slipped into the last table available sans reservation last night  and WOW....the evening went beautifully.Place was full with great vibey soundtrack - but we could easily hear each other.  Waiters were fast, attentive and unobtrusive.  Crusty hot fresh Italian bread with bruschetta dip, crisp cold wine, special dinners (husbands - half a lobster nested on homemade basil infused spaghetti with grilled scallops; mine creamy basic risotto with mushroom medley - molto bene!).  The just-right lighting/soundtrack volume, ambiance, lively crowd, fantastic fresh food and unbelievably beautiful entrees we saw whisking by to other tables --   means next time we'll order dessert and linger vs. heading out to our R&B concert. Bocca hit it - and our expectations - out of the park.  Wonderful hostess, too.  We'll be back. Just won't tell anyone else.. maybe...",2,1,0,Katrina M.,"Fairfield, CT",0,43,3

Overall, the service was friendly and for a couple of drinks each, tax and tip, it came out to about $90/person which I thought was a bit more than I was expecting.  For what we got here, it was good and I was satisfied.Buon appetito.",4,2,4,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263
1.0,11/28/2015,"Awful experience. I booked my reservation on Opentable and saw the menu for throw restaurant on there. There were pasta dishes for $14-$16 on the lunch menu. I walked in and they gave me a menu that had different prices-same $14 dish was $18 for example. I asked the waiter and he asked to see what I was looking at. I showed hi. And his response was 'we never had those prices.' I informed him that even tho this was Opentable,since I did book the reservation through them, that clearly implies the restaurant has a relationship with Opentable. All in all as a consumer they could have honored the lunch prices, especially since I was showing him a menu that I was looking at-for his restaurant. He just kept saying how bad it was and that he'd tell someone about it, rather than caring about customer service. He offered a pre fixe menu which we were not interested in and not to mention, this was a menu he had already so he wasn't doing anything FOR us. I asked for a manager he said he was in charge that day. I asked if he could do anything and he said no. We walked out. Never trying that place again be use that was enough to show that you clearly don't care about your customers.

YUM.  The beef carpaccio with arugula was okay.  A bit dry but decent.  We had the squid-ink pasta with crab meat, the garganelli with ossobuco, and raviolini.  Everything was perfectly al dente and delicious!  Lots of crab meat in the squid-ink dish and lots of veal in the ossobuco :)  Very pleased.  Also, they brought our food out in a VERY timely manner which was highly appreciated.  Finally, I left my cellphone there by accident and noticed that they actively tried to return it to me by calling the number I made my reservation with (which happened to be that same cellphone so fail, but it's the thought/gesture that counts!) :)  I knocked off a star only because the cocktail I had was terrible and gave me a headache and my husband didn't finish his wine and he RARELY doesn't finish his wine.  My drink was a watermelon martini and very very subpar.  Other than that, HIGHLY recommend for a pre-show dinner!",1,0,0,Cheryl K.,"New York, NY",43,119,0

The grilled octopus was amazing! The calamari was excellent, although the sauce was a little too spicy for my mum. All the mains were delicious. The lamb shank I find can be quite hit or miss. This was a hit! Tender & fell off the bone. Crispy skin to the fish and the flavour wasn't too 'fishy'. Pork chop came on a small chopping board so you can cut into the thick slab of meat. The spinach & brussel sprouts made for nice sides but we were too full to do them justice.

They even have wine dispensers, which I had never seen before so I was totally mesmerized by it (ah, the simple things in life)!Their cheapest bottles of wine are about $36, which is not bad. But it's their cocktails that were a complete rip off. $16 for one and it wasn't even top-shelf liquor. I would understand if a fancier place charged this much for a drink but Bocca wasn't fancy at all. On top of that, the cocktails weren't even that great.I don't know if they up charged us or if that's really how much a cocktail is there, but it definitely was not worth it IMO.

I was immensely pleased with ALL of it. The wine list, the prices, the food.. The food was authentic enough where it paid homage to classic dishes, yet you could tell through some of the combinations that someone has put heart and artistic though get into creating this menu. It was traditional on its own terms and we loved everything we had. We ordered the warm beet salad with goat cheese and green beans and walnuts.. It threw me off as it wasn't what I expected.. But I couldn't stop eating it. We shared the mushroom bruschetta which was amazing.My mother (a vegetarian) had a phenomenal tortellini and my boyfriend (manly man) thoroughly enjoyed his roast rosemary chicken with a homemade herbed gravy to die for. As for myself, I tried the lobster and shrimp risotto on special that night.. I couldn't finish it. I had stuffed myself while snacking on the fresher than fresh tomato and Tuscan bread beforehand..Don't worry. I made sure to take it to go.. And a zingy-strong coffee was the perfect way to send us to our show.. Feeling fine. Wined and dined. I will definitely keep this in mind for pre theatre dinner as it was secluded enough and not offensively busy as some of those places in the area can be.

We were very pleased.The restaurant is beautiful. It is an old building and the character has been preserved. It is comfortable, cozy and charming. I'm sorry I don't have a photo to add to this review.We arrived early and sat at the bar. Robert is a great bartender. He was well-informed about the wine list and cocktails, as you would expect, but also knew quite a bit about cheese and other bar food served at the restaurant. The beer on tap, Peroni, is not commonly available - very nice. The cucumber julep specialty cocktail was very fresh and tasty. There were many Italian wines from smaller vineyards.  #803 was delicious. We also had the formaggio misto plate. It was great - four cheeses, fig jam, fresh honey and bread. Highly recommend this appetizer!One of our main courses was the short ribs - this was cooked perfectly! The branzino was delicious, served with roasted potatoes and broccoli rabe. You can tell a lot by how good a classic like roast chicken is prepared. At Bocca di Bacco, this dish was cooked perfectly and served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. We had a quick coffee/espresso and cookies and had plenty of time to get to our show.

I had the Tre Colori Salad which was AMAZING and perfect dinner food before a night of boozing and debauchery. The bits of mushrooms and bacon were heavenly! I personally love salad and fish dishes, and this restaurant seems to be doing it right. Couple of the girls had the lamb ragu, which they moaned in delight over. The cocktails here are quite expensive, and not that great to be honest. And beware, they don't allow you to split the check by what you ordered. So, plan on sharing food family style, order about the same thing, or bring cash lol. PS: They apparently have another location in Hell's Kitchen along 9th Ave, so don't get the places confused!",0,0,0,Jasmine J.,"Honolulu, HI",10,138,371
3.0,4/2/2014,"Left after a bitter experience here. We walked in to try the $1 oysters (bar only), and expressed to the front of house we wanted to get seated at the bar specifically for this. We were seated at the tables to the side (not quite the bar but not quite the main dining area), and when we went to order the oysters we were told they were $2. I addressed the miscommunication, but the waiter was stubborn and said that at the dining area it was $3 each even (absurd pricing in my opinion!).He only offered to serve us the $1 price after I tried to seek the front of house who had told me the $1 oysters would be honored at the table we were seated at.

5.0,3/28/2014,"Can't say enough good things about this place. My boyfriend's parents were in town so, as it is my go-to restaurant for guests, we went to Bocca Di Bacco on 54th. His step dad is Italian and of course critical of Italian so I was interested to see how he would like my favorite Italian place.The place on 54th had a wait of more than an hour, but they called the location on 45th for us and reserved us a table. Loved that!Once we got there we tried the mushroom flatbread for an app, they were really yummy, I don't really care for mushroom, but they blended well with the cheese and the truffle oil, but what doesn't go well with truffle oil???I ordered a pesto risotto, I've had it before, it is topped with a really yummy fresh mozzarella and thin sliced pancetta. It. Is. So. Good. If it's on special and you like risotto, you are doing yourself a disservice by not ordering this.I convinced the boyfriend to order a veal ragut with more truffle oil, and a homemade pasta. I was later chastised for this as the veal was apparently very fatty, marking the first time we've ever had anything bad from this restaurant. His step dad ordered the veal parm, which was apparently the most delicious meal on the table. It redeemed the boyfriend's bad veal, it was perfectly cooked, the step dad loved it, and most importantly shared with the boyfriend, which sort of got me out of the dog house. This was a special and would highly recommend getting if it's available. I've never seen two adult men more excited about a piece of meat... (also that's what she said.)His mom got pork chops, which were beautifully plated and I believe came with mashed potatoes. This is a regular menu item and she loved her dish.To make up for the fatty veal in the ragut, the waitress brought him a piece of tierra misu on the house. I don't normally like it, but it was delicious.Again, a huge hit, even with the authentic Italian step dad! Win!!!",0,0,0,Kori F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,0

Not a good selection.We decided to sit at the bar for our meal and it seemed like smooth sailing - no wait! We were greeted and our drinks poured and that's where things slowed down to a grinding halt. We couldn't get the bartender's attention - he was busy talking to his bar backs, then getting the manager, then watching the bar backs on their hand and knees with flashlights behind the bar.Look, I know vermin happens. Whether it was a bug or a mouse - that's fine, it's NY, it happens. But to spend that amount of time and energy in full view of your guests to make a spectacle of it was definitely poor judgment on management's part.Should have been a sign to pick up our stuff and leave - but with promises that they'd be with us momentarily, we foolishly stayed.When we finally ordered, food came out quickly. Food was ok - I just feel like with $20+ pasta dishes they should be really good or at least memorable.

The servers are very nice and the wine/food selection seems good and the prices fairly reasonable for this type of restaurant. The wine selection was decent with several options at different price points. My wife order the braised short ribs and and I ordered the free range chicken. This is where our experience fell short. Everything looked great but the taste didn't match the appearance. My wife's ribs were ""ok"" but nothing special and my chicken was dry and lacking flavor. In fact everything was under seasoned. Very bland and I'm a fairly bland eater to begin with. Left disappointed and with all the choices in the area, we won't be coming back. Ambiance and staff get 4.5 stars.

4.0,8/12/2013,"I'm a huge fan of this restaurant and got a good sampling of their food this weekend. We were three in my party so we ordered a few dishes to share, Italian style!!  First and foremost the grilled calamari is a must!!! Thick slices of calamari, perfectly seasoned and a unique addition of celery helped cleanse the palate. I could have eaten this as my meal and been satisfied.  The arugula salad with feta was a refreshing course before our main meal, especially with the homegrown and perfectly ripened tomatoes.  We then shared the lamb shank, red snapper and gnocchi.  All superb. My favorite was probably the rep snapper, a meaty fish served with mussels and clams. Another use of celery in this dish.  The lamb  fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. The sauce/gravy was tasty. It's comes with mashed potatoes but we swamped out for Brussels sprouts (up charge and were a bit bland).  The gnocchi was cooked just right and not heavy. Topped with a simple pomodoro sauce and well executed.  We were in a rush so didn't stay for dessert.  They have a nice wine selection. They also offer $1 oyster shots at the bar only (would be nice at table for appetizer).  I will be back to try some more!!!  The restaurant is comfortable and nestled behind Times Square away from the tourists.  There are two tables in the front which are at the open windows  wait staff is attentive and friendly.",0,0,1,Stephen F.,"Manhattan, NY",74,268,161

1.0,5/31/2013,"The restaurant itself is very nice, the decor on the inside is warm and from the street, it looks inviting. And once inside, the ambiance is nice and actually, kinda romantic. So I had some expecations that the food would be quite good. The appetizers were quite good, but that is probably the best it has going for it. The service was slow. One of the dished we ordered, the monk fish with potatoes, reeked. I know that fish was not fresh. And even if it had been frozen, fish isn't supposed to stink like that when it is cooked, especially given that it was also covered in sauce. Also, the bread served was nice, but it was cold. The dessert, the creme brulee, was also served cold and quite frankly, was so full of sugar that one spoon was enough to give me a sugar high. The food overall is mediocre, not worth another visit for me. But here is the main reason why I don't like this place- there was just something offputting about this place which I couldn[t place my finger on. Something was just...off. And I couldn't figure it out until our meal was over. This place is a ghetto joint with very, very pretty walls. You ever heard of that saying, "" you can take someone out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the person""? Well, that describes this place and whoever is running it. And now that I have read some of the other reviews here on Yelp, I have validated my opinion. And I won't bother trying to visit the other restaurant further up. If this was some Dominican joint out in Jersey City, OK. Maybe I might cut it some slack, not because they are Dominican, but let's just say they don't exactly have the nicest decor and the expectations aren't exactly high expecially with that voice in the back of your head going off about potential food poisoning. But folks, I;ve been to many of those and even those people serve fresh food. Delicious, great food. If you can't be bothered to serve fresh fish, or go the extra step to heat up bread or the creme brulee when the resturant is only 20% full, what the hell else are they scrimpin on? Oh, the best part...I took my leftover Ribs home. And I asked for some pieces of bread with it. Yes, I like my carbs and after all, tomorrow is another day for my stomach. And quite frankly, I just REALLY wanted to like this place. But when I opened up my plastic container the next day, I saw two leftover crusts (literally, the crust) of bread I had left on my plate thrown in.

Each of our relatively minor requests seemed to openly irk the waiter (eg: asking for no bacon on a salad), and he seemed to make a point of not pouring wine for the table and letting us do it ourselves. The piece de resistance was when one of us asked for some biscotti with his coffee at the end of the meal, and the waiter took our bill back, rang up an extra charge for biscotti, and then brought a new bill. We were charged $8 for a few scraps of biscotti that honestly should have just been complimentary. It felt extremely tacky and inhospitable.

4.0,5/9/2013,"My friend and I were both going through some rough times with our spouses, and needed a drink BADLY. Finding a table for brunch on a Saturday in NY is the personification of the needle in the haystack, so when we walked by Bocca di Bacco and saw there were tables available, we decided to give it a go. Best decision I made that week! Such a chill environment, great waiters, short but good brunch menu (had the eggs Benedict. 7/10). But the real treat here are definately the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS. They're awesome, with a near-perfect champagne to oj ratio. The glasses are HUGE, as in Water goblet huge. Also, unlike other bottomless mimosa joints, the SECOND my glass was empty our waiter would come and fill it up with more orange bubbly goodness.  By the end of the brunch I'd drank at least 9 or 10 of them. Which reminds me, go to the bathroom BEFORE you get drunk. The stairs leading down to it are VERY steep, and can become a real hazard when you navigate them in a... ""tipsy"" state.
