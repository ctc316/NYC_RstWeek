2.0,4/23/2019,"I hate to write a negative review, but this was truly just a ""meh"" experience. The service was great, and the ambience is lovely - but the food was bland and nothing special. I'm not sure why there's so much ""hype"" surrounding this spot and this brand; the craftsmanship and artistry (regarding the dishes) was there, but the flavors were lackluster. We ordered the egg crespelle (great flavors, probably my favorite item - although $15 for a paper thin egg crepe felt a bit ridiculous), the whole wheat chimaera (again, just ""meh,"" under seasoned) and the pork chop (extreeeeemely fatty and raw in places - and I'm OK with pork being slightly ""under"" but this was extremely under-cooked). I really wanted to enjoy everything as well, and am not one to write negative reviews. Disappointing, and won't be returning. Definitely seems like the kind of place that will continue to get hype for the name/vibe, but beyond that... it's a no for me.",0,0,0,Carolyn C.,"New York, NY",12,4,0
4.0,4/8/2019,I love the experience and ambiance in Momofuku Nishi. My favorite part of dining experience are the cocktails. Cocktails are super yummy and my favorite is the old fashioned the bartender makes.I also ate at the bar top and it was very nice to dine there. I personally really like the Campanelle.

4.0,3/31/2019,"Really nice first experience at Momofuku Nishi. Great food and service, mediocre facility and seating. We were a group of 4 and were seated in one of the few booths of the restaurant. The table is a half moon, which makes it really tight for 4 people to eat at. We all found the seating at the booth extremely uncomfortable for our backs. Focusing on the more important side, the food is top notch. We started with their focaccia bread, which is baked in roasted garlic cloves and a must try (only $5!!!). Of course, we had to try the infamous bucatini ceci (chickpea) e pepe ($20), a twist to the classic cacio (cheese) e pepe. The bucatini came in a medium to small portion, but tasted extremely good and worth to try. Finally, we tried the duck as the entree. Unbelievably tender and tasty duck, seasoned and cooked to perfection and really well presented on the plate. The staff did a really good job, food came out fairly quickly (even though they warn you that entrees usually take around 45 minutes to come out). Overall great experience, thank you David Chang for another great restaurant in Manhattan.",0,0,0,Matteo G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",190,135,154
5.0,3/30/2019,"Dining at Momofuku Nishi is always an impeccable dining experience. It boasts the ideal trifecta: delicious food, excellent customer service, and comfortable ambience. The food at Nishi does not disappoint. I'm a huge fan of the bucatini (cacio e pepe), in particular the chewy texture of the hand-rolled pasta. The sauce fondly reminds me of the chickpea macaroni from Majordomo. The gem lettuce salad is a wonderful and underrated starter (the sunflower seeds and the dressing really set this salad apart) and the french fries on the side are crispy and seasoned with a mild chili powder. For the avant-garde brunch enthusiasts, I would recommend the truffle pancakes (it's off the menu!). It is glazed with truffle honey and adorned with truffles on top. The truffle pancakes are an acquired taste and yes they do taste like mushrooms and are on the savory side. Our waitress kindly brought us over some extra clover honey when my sister found the truffle flavor a bit too overwhelming. Finally, we bookend the meal with a indulgent slice of the pistachio bundt cake. The interior of the restaurant is very pristine but not pretentious. I enjoy dining at Nishi because the cushioned chairs are very comfortable and the waitstaff is very accommodating and polite. They always take the extra step to honor my request to sit at my favorite table and oftentimes when I show up with luggage (on my way to or from the train station), they'll check my luggage in the coat room for me. What I love the most about Nishi is actually the hand soap in the bathroom. They also have a hand lotion for your post-dining skincare rituals. Overall, I highly recommend treating yourself to a lovely meal at Nishi.",2,1,0,Jessica Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",243,197,3041

We tried out one of the pasta dishes with crab that had rich flavors and I think even had hints of truffle in it. Very good. The monkfish was also delicious. The consistency of the monkfish made it very satisfying and almost had a meat like texture. The purée was made from shisito peppers so that gave the dish a lighter flavor which balanced out with the pasta well.The pistachio bundt cake was a great way to top it off.

5.0,3/15/2019,"The Momofuku brand embraces the art of fine dining while ensuring accessibility. Nishi is no exception to such. I visited for lunch recently and was pleasantly pleased. The lunch menu is fairly limited in scope but still solid. I opted for the Italian Dip which is what it sounds except it comes with brisket, not roast beef. My spouse opted for a pasta dish. Our portions were generous and delicious. The only suggestion I have for Nishi is to include a small vegetable side with the Italian dip. The wine and beer list was robust for such a small space. We did not partake of the pistachio Bundt cake dessert but I have to suspect it is also of the caliber one would expect.  Momofuku continues to redefine herself. I highly recommend the next time you are in Chelsea visiting this location.

4.0,3/11/2019,"It's really hard to judge any David Chang restaurant on its own merits without letting your experience be colored by the hype train these days. I like David Chang a lot. I like his ideas, I like his personality, and I respect the heck out of what he's accomplished. But having been to a couple of his restaurants now, I'm not 100% certain I've drunk the Kool-Aid. That is to say, this is not a Momofuku stan review. I brought my visiting cousins from Japan here, because they are huge fans of Asian-Italian fusion. We ordered the focaccia, spanish mackerel, egg crepelle, tagliatelle, cacio e pepe and Long Island duck to share between us. Everything was good and the prices were about what you'd expect (but not unreasonable) for a hot ticket fusion restaurant. I actually found Momofuku Noodle Bar's prices to be WAY more unjustifiable, maybe because I'm more comfortable paying $25 for a plate of high-quality Italian-style pasta than $30 for two bao buns just because they had a sprinkling of salmon roe on top. But I digress...The housemade sourdough foccacia was an excellent way to start the meal. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside with whole cloves of garlic baked in and accompanied by an anchovy garlic oil dip. Next time I want to order the njuda spread to go with it. The seared Spanish mackerel sashimi with gooseberry sauce and ice plant was a unique crudo dish, but I'm not sure that those flavors all worked for me. Mackerel is a very strong fish and the gooseberry sort of clashed with that for me. The egg crepelle was also good, but at the end of the day the concept of an egg pancake topped with sausage is not exactly a revelation. The pasta dishes were both good. The tagliatelle with a ragu of pork and garlic chive was very good, but also oddly reminiscent of mapo tofu in terms of flavor. The chickpea based cacio e pepe, which is what Nishi is famous for, did not disappoint. All the creamy, rich flavor of cacio e pepe without the heaviness of all that dairy. The Long Island duck was also good. A large, perfectly cooked duck breast crusted with pastrami-like spices and served with a fresh salad of grapefruit and kumquat. Again, it was good, but not the most memorable duck breast dish I've ever had. I guess the moral of the story is that if you're looking for the Momofuku experience, Nishi is a perfectly agreeable option. The food is good, not unreasonably priced, and best of all, you CAN get a reservation! Now I just need to return for their fried chicken brunch...",2,0,0,Amber C.,"New York, NY",400,181,530

5.0,3/6/2019,"We had a lovely low-key dinner tonight at Momofuku Nishi. Shout out to our knowledgeable and patient server, Erica. Her recommendations were spot on for interesting flavors and portion sizes. We started with the endive salad. The combination of the crisp, fresh endive with the  caramelized onions, crunchy walnuts, and the zing of the Parmesan was a great intro to our next courses. We ordered the bucatini, perfect to share before our main dish, the lobster fra diavolo with spaghettini. The crisp lobster, delicately fried in a light batter was disjointed for easy eating. The pasta sauce was a delicious and spicy combination of chunky tomatoes and jalapeño peppers with fresh basil over al dente pasta. Terrific. We skipped dessert because there were no chocolate offerings. Would totally recommend this attractive space for great food and excellent service.",0,0,0,Marcia G.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,43,0
2.0,3/6/2019,"I am generally a big Momofuku and David Chang fan, but this place was not live up to expectations. I took my girlfriend here for a low key anniversary celebration and while the service wasn't awesome, the food was extremely underwhelming. I can deal with not great service for good food, but this place didn't really have either. We got the pasta tasting menu with a wagyu beef crudo to start. I have a shellfish allergy and even though it's not deadly, I don't enjoy my throat getting itchy. I made it very clear to the waiter that I have a shellfish allergy and yet, I'm pretty sure there was shellfish incorporated in the crudo somehow. It might have been something else, but I'm fairly sure because the smell of shellfish really sticks out to me. I couldn't really taste it though because it was over salted. For the pasta tasting, again, I have a shellfish allergy, so we asked if we could get the risotto without shellfish. The waiter said we would have to replace it with the tagliatelle. Fine by me. One point in huge favor of the service was that the waiter offered to put some black truffle on the cacio e pepe to make up for us not getting any black truffle with the risotto. Unfortunately, there was not black truffle on the cacio e pepe when it came out. I am pretty sure they just forgot, because the waiter claimed the chef said it would go better with the tagliatelle. I don't know about you, but I have never thought truffle and tomato would go well together and I think this experience proved my point. Finally, there was the orecchiette with the duck sausage. I can honestly say I have never eaten anything so salty in my life. Definitely not going back, but not so bad it should only get 1 Star.TL;DR - There was shellfish in my food even though I have a shellfish allergy and made that clear. A lot of the food was really over-salted. The kitchen put black truffle on a tomato sauce based pasta which was not good.",0,0,0,John R.,"Philadelphia, PA",164,11,0
4.0,2/27/2019,"I came to Momofuku Nishi to try their famous bucatini, but to my disappointment, the portion was really really small. It tasted good, but not amazing. Compared to the other Momofuku restaurants, I would go elsewhere, especially with Bāng Bar taking over the Time Warner Center (huge fan of Bāng Bar).My review of Momofuku Nishi was salvaged by the pork chop sandwich.

The lemon and chili added to the scallop made it tase so fresh and made it different than any other scallop I've had. What a brilliant way to eat scallop.

4.0,2/16/2019,"Chang's Nishi puts an Asian twist on classic Italian flavorsFood:4.5/5Experience:3.75/5Food Eaten: Bucatini (amazing), Tagliatelle, Bonji Old Fashion (cocktail)There's so many similarities between pasta and noodles -- Asian and Italian cuisine -- that it seems almost intuitive for Chang to open a restaurant that capitalizes on these commonalities. The Asian influence at Nishi is subtle -- you won't find pork buns or ramen on this Momofuku menu. Instead, Chang carefully weaves Asian ingredients such as uni and Korean sausage into different dishes on the menu. Open up the cocktail menu, and you'll spot cocktails made with yuzu sake and caramom.Playing on this theme, I remember listening to one of David Chang's podcasts where he discusses the differences in perceptions of Asians and Italian food. Charge $30 for a pasta dish, people don't bat an eyelash. Charge $30 for a bowl of noodles, and there's an immediate uproar. While Chang's signature Noodle Bar successfully elevates something perceived as ""common"" like a bowl of ramen, Nishi takes a different approach -- seeking to elevate the traditional flavors of Italian cuisine into the more hip, contemporary Momofuku brand. But, anyways, let's get into my actual review:ExperienceI came here on a Friday night and made a reservation online. The decor is minimalistic, and I noticed there were paintings made by Chang himself, which was pretty awesome. The crowd is comprised pretty young (mid-late 20s) hip, Chelsea types. While the restaurant was completely packed, it definitely was not claustrophobic. It's a good spot for a date or a small group.The service was fairly slow, as the waiters seemed very busy. My only issue was that there was a 20-minute lag between us being seated and the waitress taking our drink order(!), which kind of started the meal out poorly. But, understandably, the restaurant was incredibly busy.FoodI tried two dishes. The first was the iconic Bucatini (cece e pepe). You can definitely taste the hints of chickpea in the pasta, which put an interesting twist on the Italian classic. It's a simple dish (noodles, parmesan, pepper), and Chang's rendition does not disappointment. The best part was the texture -- it was the perfect amount of al dente. I'd go back to the restaurant for the bucatini alone.The second dish we had was the tagliatelle. It was, unexpectedly, pretty spicy, which I really enjoyed. The pork was cooked well and all the flavors combined nicely to create a hearty, filling pasta. The meat/tomato sauce in the dish paired nicely with the more simple flavors in the bucatini. The bonji old fashion cocktail was also great and helped tone down some of the heat from the tagliatelle. There was nothing crazy or unexpected about the flavors, but, sometimes, simple is better.One thing I really appreciated were the portion sizes. I generally find that classic Italian restaurants offer heaps and heaps of pasta that are impossible to finish. Two pasta dishes here were the perfect amount for two people (I'd say order 3 if you're hungry).  The desert menu was pretty limited, so we opted to grab a slice of crack pie & cereal milk ice cream from Tosi's Momofuku milk bar down the street. Overall, the pasta was well-executed with some unexpected twists and flavors. I'll definitely be back.",1,0,0,Anushka M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",320,14,18

The Asian pears give it a great balance. The Bucatini is a must!! Tagliatelle was delicious and not heavy at all. The only reason I gave them 3 stars and not 4 is because of the wine.

Called last minute for a brunch reservation for five people (I know, I should have known better) and had a lovely experience with a manager named Andy Wedge over the phone. He got us a table for the next afternoon and didn't even seem annoyed at my lack of preparation. We were lucky to get a spot, to be clear I would not recommend my form of booking. The brunch menu is simple yet well thought out. We started with some perfectly pickled vegetables and an anchovy endive salad.  Everyone agreed the salad was a star of the menu and surprisingly easy to share! Fresh, flavorful, fun, and gorgeous to boot. For a classic brunch, we ordered the Eggs in Purgatory-a deliciously smoky baked egg dish with pork in tomato sauce. Huge dish, they highly encourage sharing. Wonderfully filling without being too heavy or indulgent. Crowd pleaser.  Next came the bucatini, their flagship pasta dish. In layman's terms, it was the best mac and cheese any of us had ever had. Perfectly thick al dente noodles, fresh ground black pepper, elegant creamy sauce. Third we ordered a pork garlic tagliatelle dish that perfectly balanced the bucatini (at the suggestion of our waiter). A great hit of spice and that fresh garlic one craves in a good pasta. Nothing we ordered was less than extraordinary and everything blew away our expectations.

We were only one of two tables, so I can't speak for when they're much busier, but I was honestly impressed with how quick and friendly the waitstaff were. I ordered a King Cake cocktail to start. It was a well-balanced drink. Not too sweet or strong. We ordered the sourdough focaccia with Burrata and bottarga which was shaved on top of the Burrata. The umami touch the bottarga added was a welcomed treat. For entrees we had the bucatini and impossible burger (save the environment and all that jazz) with fries. I have to admit that unlike the other reviews that I've read I was not a fan of the bucatini. I guess chickpea hozon does nothing for me. The pasta was expertly prepared though. My brother raved about the impossible burger and his fries. Feeling a bit dissatisfied with my bucatini I may have found refuge in his French fries. I have to agree the fries were bomb.

5.0,1/6/2019,"Had a really excellent dining experience here! This is a great place to go for a long, fun, exciting dinner. To start, we shared the sweetbreads appetizer with mushrooms. Omg, I wish this dish was 4x bigger because it was flawless. My date and I both expressed a strong desire to take a bath in the Marsala sauce. The mushrooms and meat were both so juicy! Next, we got the pasta tasting, which is four courses of mini pasta samplers: 1) honeynut squash agnolotti with chicken skin. Although I really disliked the chicken skin on this (it was kind of salty and bland and didn't really add much to the dish), the pasta itself was fantastic. Each little pasta was a delicious burst of bright orange squash flavor in your mouth 2) the ceci e Pepe -- I'm honestly shook that the flavor in this comes not from cheese, but from chickpea miso. It tastes like cheese, but somehow better?? It was so creamy and delicious. We also noted how perfectly al dente cooked the pasta was 3) the risotto with langostine -- this was probably the least exciting of the pasta tasting. It was a little too salty and while it was not bad, it just didn't shine next to the other amazing pastas we'd tried4) the orecchiette with duck sausage and tomatillos -- this was kind of like eating taco pasta and we were HERE FOR IT. Every bite had so much flavor and so much meaty juice.We also got their special, which was Korean ribs. I actually really did not like these -- there was a sweet sauce on them that was gloopy and overpowering. It kind of ruined the meat's smoky flavor. However, the meat was super tender and really fell off of the bone. Also, my date said they were his favorite part of the meal so I may be in the minority in disliking them. Finally, we got 2 desserts with our pasta tasting (no, I'm not sure how we ate all of this, either). A Campari-grapefruit tart and a sunchoke ice cream sandwich. Neither was spectacular, but they were fun! What I have to compliment above all else here was the quality of the service. Our waitress (I don't remember her name but she had cat-eye glasses and cool geometric earrings) was phenomenal, as was the rest of the staff. We literally never even had a half-empty water glass -- someone always came by to refill it. I was impressed not only by how attentive and friendly she was, but also by the depth of knowledge from the staff: I didn't know what langostine was, and when I asked, I got a detailed explanation as to its history and where it had come from and why they had chosen to include it in the dish. I'm beyond impressed with everyone in this restaurant. We were there for almost 3 hours and the time just flew by -- the whole experience was super fun and I'd definitely go again.

We tried to order the steak but were told they were ""cutting"" it as we spoke. We found out 30 minutes later, thank god after we already had ordered 2x of the bucatini to start, that it was ready...but only after asking the waiter at least 3-4x times, which made us feel embarrassed.We did not order the steak, but did order some focaccia instead, which was REALLY good.My wife listens to David Chang's podcast every week, and this was just such a letdown for this price point. All in all, the meal was over $100 for a glass of beer, a glass of box wine, 2x portions of pasta, some bread, and the bundt cake. The food was very good, but the fact that we literally had to beg the waiter to see if we could drop another $90 for a steak simply made us angry and we will not be coming back.Note to Dave, up the beverage game, which my wife said had already been sort of known at your establishments, and also, make sure your servers are attentive and don't hide when we are trying to order food. You simply lost out on an what would have been another $100 simply because you didn't prepare enough steak for dinner service on a Friday night?",3,0,0,Travis D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,56,8

4.0,12/27/2018,"Momofuku Nishi is a cool spot to have various international cuisines with an Asian twist to them. Kudos to David Chang for doing a great job in infusing Asian cooking in the dishes served here. For lunch/brunch, I definitely recommend the Bucatini. It was incredibly buttery and creamy, and a plate can be shared for 2 people. I would also recommend the Eggs in Purgatory, which is a great homage to the classic Shaksouka but with tofu as opposed to eggplant. For salad, I would suggest trying out the Red Endive. Every bite was a treat to your taste bud indeed. Overall, Nishi is an awesome food option that I'd recommend in NYC!",2,0,1,Em R.,"Boston, MA",156,163,208

We got two entrees and 1 appetizer. The waiter made me feel uneasy because he was convincing us to order more food... like no is no dude. Then when we finished our meal, he asked if we wanted dessert, and we passed because we were too full. But felt like he gave us a dissatisfy look. UGH.So anyways, we were chatting for a bit after that, and then a staff came up to us and basically TOLD US WE HAD TO LEAVE. At first I was still processing it in my head until the table next to us said ""that is so rude."" Mind you, it's only been a little over 1 hour since we were seated. They could have told us when we sat down like ""hey we have a reservation at x time so we will need the table by then"" I would have been totally fine, but to stare us down and then stand by my table and say you need to leave is so rude.

Tagliatelle with pork skin: An Asian-fusion bolognese that was decently flavorful but nothing remarkable.  It was literally 3-5 bites of pasta.2. Campanelle with crab: This was good but not great - the actual crab portion was tiny and the flavor was rather on the bland side.  It tasted like a plain pasta with shreds of crab.3. Dagwood: It's literally a triple decker with pork, pate, and sardines with mayo for a tart, creamy, and savory mix.  Not a great well-balanced flavor mix.  The fries were also very meh.Overall, definitely did not meet expectations, especially for the price and service.  It was also very empty during peak brunch hours at 1 pm on a Sunday.  Maybe dinner is better but skip the brunch.",0,0,2,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1915,85

The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was perfectly seasoned. We also loved the whole wheat chitarra, which had great anchovy flavor.

The ginger is subtle and the honey and lemon help smooth out the whiskey. Striped Bass - meyer lemon, green chili 17 was my least favourite dish. It's thinly sliced sashimi style and subtle flavours. Go for the endive salad as a starter instead from the recommendations. Bucatini - ceci e pepe  20 - it's one of the must haves here. No cheese using fermented chick peas.

4.0,11/20/2018,"Mixed feelings about Momofuku but mostly positive!Sat at the bar and got the tasting menu for $62. Here's how I'd break down my experience:Bar/drinks - A. Bartender was great. I got a red wine which they serve by the ""quartino"" and seems expensive at first glance but it's actually about a glass and a half so not so bad for $17-20. My friend date got a cocktail at $16 which was expertly made in front of us and quite tasty!Pasta - A. Loved all the three main pasta dishes (agnolotti, bucatini and orecchiette). Not sure if it fits in the pasta category but the first dish was a cold soup (stellette?) and that I could have done without, but all hot, regular pasta was very very good! Dessert - D. This may reflect my lack of sophistication but the two dessert dishes neither myself nor my date enjoyed and I am a dessert person! The first was a grapefruit & campari tart that was much too bitter and overpowering. Too bites was all I could manage. The second was a gourmet ice cream sandwich of sorts of which mine had a beef fat butterscotch ice cream (my date does not eat beef, they asked about any dietary restrictions at the start). Maybe it was a mental hurdle but I couldn't get over the beef fat, I felt like I was eating smoked meat when I wanted ice cream. The regular dessert menu looks great, so I wish I had requested something from there instead of the tasting menu desserts.Service - A. Various waiters brought out our dishes one at a time and promptly cleared them away.Atmosphere - A. Cozy, warm, bar was probably better than the tables tightly in a row but I was very comfortable and enjoyed it. Value - B. We did get quite a lot, I just wish I had liked all courses!Next time I'd get a pasta dish and maybe the gem salad to share (looked really good, I saw others with it) and select my own dessert.",0,0,0,MaryKate M.,"Cleveland, OH",156,119,127

Things just come out as they're done so we went over an hour between our last small dish and our mains which drove me nuts. Then, as we got our mains we overheard the table next to us as they were getting told so delicious special that were never even mentioned to us. Also, for a family style type of restaurant where several dishes per person are suggested, the menu doesn't have nearly enough options on it.

5.0,11/8/2018,"I'm surprised it took me this long to go to ANY of Momofuku's restaurants (even Milk Bar!), but I'm so glad that Nishi got to be my first, even if it is one of David Chang's lesser known restaurants. I came with a close friend who was visiting on business, and we came here without reservations (and found it through a local google search of all things!). Nonetheless, the staff was friendly, and was able to find a table for us. The ambiance is sleek, beautiful but unpretentious, with lots of people buzzing over shareable plates.When we were seated, we noticed that the menu was concise, and gave a lot of different options to choose from. Pricey, but we knew what quality of food we would be in for. However, in a deviation from what you'd expect at a Momofuku restaurant, Nishi is more Italian-influenced, with an emphasis on pasta and family style portions. However, that doesn't mean you can't find any uni. The waitstaff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable in the food, as they allowed us to pick meals that would fit my friend's diet (she's pescatarian). We ended up ordering a smaller amount of food, specifically the fried head-on shrimp with pepper and lime, as well as the campanelle with blue crab and old bay.The service was decent for a crowded restaurant during the dinner rush, as we didn't have to wait long for either dish. Both were plated quite beautifully. The head-on shrimp are small and look a little daunting (because they, you know, have their heads still on), but we easily knocked these back (they're supposed to be eaten whole). They're crunchy, with a decent amount of spice that dances on your tongue without leaving your nose running. My friend and I agreed though, that a little extra lime juice goes a long way. The campanelle was cooked to perfection and garnished with parsley, giving it this brilliant green hue. The blue crab was petite, but tender, not too chunky. The old bay flavor was slight, a whisper, more of an aftertaste, and I just wanted a little more. But maybe I needed to realize that old bay can come in intensities that are not just at 11.Overall, I'd absolutely be back here, and am motivated to try even more Momofuku restaurants.

4.0,10/22/2018,"This was my fifth different Momofuku dining experience in NYC over the past decade. Once upon a time, David Chang put his chef's hat on Southern comfort Asian specialties like his stellar steamed buns and luscious pork belly ramen. But his restaurant empire and brand name has grown exponentially since those more years innocent days, and his culinary style has also broadened, maybe overstretched a bit to the point where neither Jamie W. nor I recognized the more Italianate brunch menu as something a Chang disciple would create.We made a reservation since any Momofuku fills up quickly, and it did. It was a long space but not really that big. The brunch menu was quite concise - six entrees (including an impossible burger), four pastas, two salads, and various antipasto (photo: bit.ly/2yVKUD5). No buns, no ramen, no bo ssam. Just hearty-sounding plates with a decided Italian accent. We decided to start with the $16 Red Endive Salad served warm with walnuts and bagna càuda, which is a thick sauce made with garlic, anchovies, butter, and olive oil (photo: bit.ly/2yX8Wh4). It was simply made and quite tasty with the endive providing a nice crunch.Jamie went for the $18 Eggs in Purgatory, s familiar breakfast staple given an Asian trust as tofu and a Sichuan spice mix were added to the eggs and pork hash still bubbling in a cast iron pan (photo: bit.ly/2SaHaq6). It was hearty with an unexpected spikiness that made the dish resonate more. I had the similarly savory $18 Smoked Brisket Hash which let the sunny side up eggs take center stage over the brisket and salsa verde which was almost invisible on my plate (photo: bit.ly/2q5899Q). In fact, the brisket was overshadowed by the massive amount of sautéed potatoes.

3.0,10/16/2018,"I wanted to love Momofuku Nishi. We were visiting NYC for five days, and it was the meal I was most looking forward to. But I just didn't think it lived up to the hype or the price! Our table of three started with the endive and wagyu crudo starters. The endive was good, but extremely simple, and I can't believe how much we paid for some endive and a little walnut bagna cauda (walnuts, walnut oil, anchovies). The wagyu was also good and seemed a more reasonable price to me. (The wagyu crudo is served on milk toast with anchovies.)The three of us then did the pasta tasting. It's $62 per person, and your whole table has to do it. It comes with four pastas. Our first pasta was the stellette with clams and green garlic. This was easily my least favorite of the pastas. Stellette is the tiny pasta that looks like little stars (stellette means little stars in Italian) that takes about a minute to cook in broth. This was served cold, and I didn't taste green garlic or clams. It tasted of a vegetable broth that had a few quarters of heirloom cherry tomatoes in it and maybe some basil oil? Very bland and unimpressive. Our second pasta was the agnolotti - a filled pasta. The agnolotti was filled with corn puree and served with trout roe. This one was OUTSTANDING. The corn in the agnolotti was delicious, and when you got a bite of the trout roe, it was a pop of salt in your mouth that worked really well with the sweet corn puree. I would have ordered a plate of this.Our third pasta was their bucatini ceci e pepe (a play on cacio e pepe) made with chickpeas (ceci is Italian for chickpeas). This was also outstanding. I also would have ordered a plate of this.Our fourth pasta was orecchiette with duck sausage, tomatillo, and mezcal. This one wasn't a hit for our table either. I think the duck sausage was a bit strange, and the sauce made from tomatillos made me feel like I was eating pasta in a bowl of salsa. At least I couldn't really taste the mezcal (not a fan). But I definitely wouldn't want to eat this pasta again. They also brought us two desserts (maybe it's included in the pasta tasting?). The first was a Campari gelee cream tart. It was horrible. The Campari was extremely strong. I couldn't taste the rest of the tart at all, even though the gelee layer was quite thin. My friend and I took the Campari gelee layer off, and then we could taste the tart (the crust was actually fantastic, although the cream filling had little taste), but the taste of that awful Campari gelee was still there. To be honest, I'm not a fan of Campari anyway - and I'm not sure it could work in desserts, but this dessert definitely didn't work for any of us (although my husband quite enjoys Campari and found the gelee layer more palatable than my friend and I). The second dessert they brought us was a pistachio gelato and figs served in a sort of macaron-shaped shell made from what tasted like wafer ice cream cone. This was decent, but nothing to write home about. We all had a couple of drinks (wine for me, wine and cocktail for my friend, and two cocktails for my husband). The service was very good. The restaurant is nice inside, but nothing too memorable. The meal took a very long time, but I don't mind that so much (other people do, which is why I've included that fact here); we were probably there for 2-3 hours. We left several hundred dollars poorer and not really that impressed by the meal. I certainly wouldn't recommend people doing the pasta tasting unless you don't mind spending that kind of money and not loving everything. I thought that the meal had highlights (agnolotti, ceci e pepe, wagyu crudo), but we also tried a lot of things we really didn't like at all.

5.0,10/4/2018,"We made a dinner reservation for 3 and were seated immediately. Restaurant doesn't fit that many people so I highly recommend reservations. Bucatini - It looks extremely simple yet it tastes so good. It's a creamy sauce with some black pepper. No meat or veggies to distract from the noodles. Portion size is a bit small. Tagliatelle - it's slightly spicy and well flavored. I felt like this was the most basic dish out of all the ones I tried. Lamb leg - Asian steak. Interesting seasoning and the eggplant is a bit firey. Came medium rare yet not overly chewy. Duck breast - this was really good. Skin is crispy, meat is succulent with a thin layer of fat in between. It cuts so smooth. Really thick pieces of duck breast.Service was efficient and quick. I highly recommend the bucatini and duck breast. You'll definitely spend a lot here cause each dish is so expensive and not super filling.",3,1,2,Edward W.,"New York, NY",413,1545,2963
2.0,10/4/2018,"I stumbled across this restaurant before a movie and decided to grab a quick bite from the bar. First thing of note for you beer drinkers, they had 4 or 5 varieties and they ranged in price from $9-13. To start, I had the fried shrimp which apparently you eat whole. This was a new experience for me, and while I didn't mind the texture (outside of a few jabs to the gums), I couldn't finish them. The lemon and black pepper seasoning actually made my mouth numb after a while.I can never pass up ordering cacio e pepe, so that was my entree order. The bucatini was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was too sweet. I liked the strong black pepper flavor but the sweetness left an unpleasant taste in my mouth.

4.0,9/27/2018,"Had a 8:45 PM on a Monday night reservation and we figured that the place would be relatively open.  Yet, when we walked in we had to wait for a little under 10 minutes as our table still had occupants.  This seemed odd considering that there were still several tables that were open as is, but whatever.  The staff were very attentive and had a good sense of humor.  For starters we had an off the menu lightly fried shrimp that was so good that I would not have a problem just eating that all night.  Our main dish was the Lobster Fra Diavolo and the first thing I thought when I saw it was that the dish reminded me of a Chinese Lo mein dish with fried lobster on top.  The lobster was a little salty and in my opinion didn't need to be fried so heavily.  That being said, the dish was good but you will need a couple of cups of water to drink down while eating this dish.  Overall the food was good and the staff was great, the minor details that would seem negative doesn't shadow over the good but it is enough to say there are little tweaks.",1,0,1,Derek T.,"Glenview, IL",1,28,23
5.0,9/25/2018,"My first meal at Momofuku Nishi was underwhelming; I had the impossible burger and a butter pasta dish for lunch. The impossible burger was a great deal; it was simple and tasty, and if I could make burgers like that, I would not need to eat meat. The butter pasta, which was twice as expensive and half as good, was hugely disappointing. I felt that my soy sauce shiitake mushroom shrimp butter pasta was much better - and when a dish I can cook ends up being better than a restaurant's ... well, that's that. So I didn't return to Momofuku Nishi for almost two years - only after I had tried Momofuku Ssam at the suggestion of a visiting friend. It was a revelation. When another friend wanted to go to a Momofuku restaurant for his birthday, I suggested Nishi since it was centrally located, even though I had reservations. It ended up being spectacular. We opted to get individual dishes, and I shared with my boyfriend while taking small bites out of everyone else's. Since we didn't do family style, we lost out on variety; 3 people ended up getting the cavatelli with crab and old bay, and 2 people got the pasta with pork rind. They were both decent, but I was not a huge fan of either of the pasta dishes. The wagyu toast and the pork shank that we got, however, were absolutely incredible. + Wagyu toast - This was a pretty generous portion of wagyu atop milk bread toast, and I loved the mouthfeel of the marinated, practically raw wagyu with the crunchy rice balls. I would totally recommend this. + Pork - Given the price and the portions of pasta I had seen, I didn't expect this dish to be as massive as it was. Not only was there too much meat for the two of us (after the toast and the cavatelli), but the meat was one of the best renditions of pork I've ever had. I would get this again in a heartbeat. Pre-cut and ultra tender, the pork almost melted in our mouths. For a non-fatty meat that wasn't beef, it was unexpectedly decadent. Each bite felt like a pork version of kobe. As much as I wanted to eat it all on my own, I absolutely had to share so that everyone else at the table could be as transformed. (Also there was way too much for my boyfriend and me). The pork alone made Momofuku Nishi 5 stars for me. Overall, I think David Chang's menu is hit-or-miss, but I think it's totally worth it to experience his creativity, especially on those occasions when he executes it perfectly. Service was pretty good, and I was able to make reservations easily on Opentable. I even was able to call and change my party from 6 to 7, and they said they'd accommodate us if we were willing to be a little tight. :)",5,0,1,Liana L.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",490,692,2389

3.0,9/16/2018,"Honestly, the bud and I were so excited to check this spot out - we'd seen the 'grams, after all! Especially that Lobster Fra Diavolo dish!! But tbh, both pasta dishes we ordered for sharing fell short. We had reservations for 8:30pm on a Thursday night. The place was packed. It doesn't seem like they get a whole lot of walk-ins, so I'm not 100% sure about wait times without ressies. The waitress was knowledgeable, but not the friendliest. We were considering the tasting menu, but there was a meat dish on the list. Since I'm pescatarian, I asked if there was any substitution options, and she immediately said no. I mean, I get it, if you let on sub, it'll open the floodgates for others. But it was more unfortunate for my bud. If anyone gets the tasting menu at your table, everyone has to get it. So even though I couldn't get it, my friend wanted it, but the waitress said absolutely no can do! It wasn't like I wouldn't order my own meal, but it is what it is, I suppose. Awkward nonetheless. In the end, we each ordered a drink. And the rest of the dishes for family style sharing. The waitress let us know that the Lobster Fra Diavolo was a must. It was a bit pricey at $62, but we went for it. We also went with the Gem Salad and Bucatini (ceci e pepe). Of the three dishes, we unanimously agreed that the best dish of the night was the Gem Salad...which speaks to our thoughts on the pasta dishes. Personally, the pasta itself in the Bucatini tasted undercooked. I'm all about the al dente life, but this wasn't that. It was just too hard. Also, the sauce was too sweet for our liking. We're used to the cheesy, peppery goodness of a usual ceci e pepe dish. As for the Lobster Fra Diavolo dish, ah, we agreed that this was a typical dish you could get in Chinatown...for MUCH cheaper. It seemed obscenely overpriced for what it was. And a bit of a sweet and sour flavor to the mochi noodles that we weren't particularly fans of. The lobster pieces were good, but completely overpowered by the salty, fried shell. Which brings me back to the gem salad. This dish was nice and light. The peppery dressing, along with the almost smokiness of the sunflower seeds, made for a unique flavor combo. The twist of this fusion dish paired perfectly with the freshness of the veggies. All in all, was the meal worth $80+/pp? No. Would I come back again? Very unlikely. 3 stars.",1,1,1,Jennifer L.,"San Francisco, CA",140,375,1438

4.0,9/10/2018,"More like a solid 3.5. Some dishes at Momofuku Nishi are delicious, while others are meh. Overall though, the pasta is made well.Bucatina ceci e pepe (2) - All the Yelp reviews rave about this dish, but I've had it twice and both times found it way too pepper-y. I suppose if you like very pepper-y pasta, then you might like it. Ravioli, ricotta and chili honey (4) - unique, simple, and delicious. I would recommend this dish to share as table since if I had to eat the whole plate myself, it might be a bit too much. Campanelle with blue crab, old bay (5) - after ordering this dish, my friends and I fell in love with it that we immediately ordered a second plate so that we could all have some more. If I go back to Momofuku Nishi, it will be because of this dish. Upon looking at the menu, I didn't think much of it but was shocked with how great it was.Lobster fra diavolo (2) - Was expecting a lot of this, but mainly because I love lobster.

5.0,9/10/2018,"My friends and I came to Momofuku Nishi for the first time and we had a great experience. I made reservations for 10:45pm but they were able to seat us earlier. The server was very knowledgable, accommodating, and friendly. All the food we ordered were delicious and more than enough for 5 people. We had the following:* Montauk Scallop - the portion was a little small. All 5 of us must've only had one each, which our server did mention so we were not surprised. Regardless, it tasted great.* Surf & Turf -  this was everyones favorite! This starter comes with Sourdough Focaccia, Nduja, and a tin of sardines that may look small but it was enough for all of us. The way to eat this is to put nduja (which is a spread) on the sourdough then some sardines. It's definitely the perfect combination! * Bucatini - a little salty for our liking but it was still delicious. Pasta was cooked very al dente!* Tagliatelle  - this was my personal favorite because it has a little kick. I'd say it was also great because the meat to pasta ratio was perfect. You can really taste the pork skin on this - very flavorful!* Lobster Fra Diavlo - This meal is $62. Was it worth it? I'd say it depends on how hungry or how much you like lobster. It is definitely a bigger plate than the other pasta meals. It has a whole lobster that were partially cut up and breaded. The pasta was delicious, it also had a little kick. Since we ordered 3 pasta meals, when we got to this plate, we were somewhat already full.* Roast Pork - this pork was also everyone's favorite. It was roasted to perfection, portion was good enough and the pea shoots was a good touch. This restaurant is family style so it is shared plates. 1 pasta meal would probably be ideal for 2 people. The portions aren't  that big. I suggest to order starters, pasta, and meat to complete your whole meal.",0,0,0,Anna 'Cesca' A.,"Jersey City, NJ",82,17,12

The dishes are Italian with an Asian inspiration. Of these, I did not care too much for the focaccia and the tagliatelle reminded me of a Taiwanese noodle dish with ground meat. The second time I went for lunch, I insisted on a reservation which was not necessary. I loved the antipasti dishes. The spicy long beans were so unique. The ravioli were more sweet than spicy but so luscious. We had a decadent club sandwich with duck confit and pate. Though the meats were rich, the white bread was the indulgence for me (a simple carb!)  Most recently, I had the lobster fra diavolo reminiscent of my favorite Cantonese dish, lobster over egg noddles.

4.0,9/6/2018,"Nishi offers a unique culinary experience. You can't really achieve the same thing at other restaurants. It's a modern take on traditional dishes, in this case mostly Italian. Unconventional flavors and ingredients are used to ""enhance"" (in quotes because this is probably controversial among purists) dishes and offer a wider spectrum of tastes in each bite.The portions are small, which is a bummer. But the point of these dishes is to share and experience the flavors with others. The intricate dishes are conversation starters, and I can see this being a great date spot for that reason. This immersive tasting experience is a fresh contrast to our typical ""passive eating"".I encourage you to savor each bite slowly. Trust me. The sensory stimulus from each taste is through the roof so don't rush it. This is coming from someone who is a big eater (read: pig) with a voracious appetite. It's not the type of restaurant to get your fill. You technically could, but you'd be spending a lot just to be satiated.Each dish here is a trip of flavors. Here's what I'd definitely recommend:- Wagyu Crudo: Very interesting appetizer. The beef just melts in your mouth, and is seasoned with a mysterious combination of things that just works. The milk bread it sits on adds good texture contrast. - **Bucatini ceci e pepe**: A classic pasta dish elevated to pack an insane fusion of flavors. It's simple and complex at the same time. One of my favorite pastas in NYC, and probably the best version of cacio e pepe I've ever tasted. I wish I could have a whole plate of it, but this portion is small and for sharing. - BBQ Pork Ribs: These tender ribs are sweet, sour, and a little smokey. Again, I wish there were more!Also good was the Leg of Lamb. It was really flavorful meat, but I wasn't a fan of the eggplant that it came with.Dishes take a really long time to prepare. So get ready to wait a while. The service is excellent though. Our waiter described the dishes in great detail and was honest about his opinion on things. Mid-way through our meal, one of the staff members offered to rearrange our table to give us more room, which was nice.Yeah, it's on the expensive size, and portions are small, but the flavor is top notch.

5.0,8/15/2018,"I live in the neighborhood and was VERY excited when this opened.Initially, the place got a luke warm NYT review, but I find I find Peter Wells reviews to be overly critical to the point of being combative - as if he wants to be the one person who doesn't like something - I enjoyed the First menu quite a lot - some original and palate challenging dishes, but the luke warm review did lead to a minor renovation of the space (making it quieter with more comfortable seating) - and a rearrangement of the menu.  I loved the food on the first menu - thank goodness they just rearranged it a bit - renaming some of the challenging sounding dishes adding some other excellent options. It keeps me coming back to try new additions that keep getting added.This is not a menu for a bland palate - although everyone can find something to enjoy  - I see some complaints here about prices, but I think it is fairly price for such well prepared delicious food with excellent service. The portion sizes are not large, but I am always satisfied with the complete meal.  I guess they were expecting the big bowls and moderate prices from Momofuku Noodle Bar - which this is not - It is a much more developed experience.

4.0,8/12/2018,Came here on a Tuesday afternoon for restaurant week. I was seated right away. The service was friendly and helpful. I had a few questions about the menu and my waiter politely answered all of my questions. For my appetizer I ordered the scallop crudo with Meyer lemon and green chili. The fresh scallop tasted like the ocean and the acidity of the Meyer lemon cut through the scallop. For the entree I ordered the skate wing with salsa verde and pea shoots. I've never had skate wing before and I'm happy I got to taste it prepared in a simple yet elegant way. For the dessert I had the frozen vanilla mousse with black lime and amaro. I've also never black lime but it's something I need to have more often. This dessert was an explosion of flavor! Overall this was a perfect meal for a very hot summer day.

Perhaps I should've went w/the skate wing instead.  The plating of the Smoked Brisket entree & the Frozen Vanilla Mousse dessert were unappetizing. The entree looked like it was from a diner & the dessert was a ghastly mess. I can picture Gordon Ramsay going off on the presentation of it. Seriously lumps of uneven frozen vanilla mousse topped with black sauce all over?

We really wanted to try the pasta tasting menu for $65, but unfortunately we were in a bit of a rush to catch a movie afterwards. That said, the service felt kinda slow, but that's probably because we were anxious to leave. For our appetizer, we ordered the Montauk scallop to share (it came with rhubarb).

We ordered the pasta tasting menu and I think it just started on the wrong foot with the cold clam soup. I suppose this was included because it had tiny star-shaped pastas in the soup? It was a real miss for a $62 tasting menu. The caccio e pepe pasta was the best dish, but too tiny of a portion to make up for the other selections.

We weren't full but satisfied for the moment and ended up eating a late night meal later at Great NY Noodle house next to our hotel as featured on Ugly Delicious.

I am not a big person and could barely squeeze through to get to my seat in between tables. I recently wrote a bad review and accused our waitress of taking my husbands credit card. That wasn't cool of me. It was the last place he used his credit card. And honestly anything could have happened.  Her service was fine, not great, but not bad either. I was upset, because I didn't want this kind of thing happening to any one else just in case this was happening a lot there. I thought that whoever made these charges seemed pretty brazen.

He did recommend the bucatini, which I ordered with a fried egg. It came out quickly and was delicious. Perfectly cooked pasta that was Al dente with cracked black pepper.

If you're expecting traditional Italian, you'd better look somewhere else. They do a $62pp pasta tasting. If I were with a larger group, I definitely would've been tempted. However, I was dining alone as a walk-in (they were able to sneak me in for a quick meal between reservations).For my appetizer, I went with the raw Montauk diver scallops with rhubarb in a nasturtium flower water topped with mint. It was like a fresh summer cocktail. The scallops were perfectly tender and fresh.For pasta, I had the tagliatelle with pork skin. By the description, I expected crispy pork skin, but it was closer to a ground pork ragu Bolognese. Still delicious and meaty.Portion sizes were more modest than traditional Italian, but it was very rich so a little went a long way.The cocktail list was very summery. The Witch Daisy (with gin, Strega, lemon, honey, and sage) was wonderfully refreshing. Their beer selection is a lot of local beers but a bit pricey.Service was excellent.

I ordered the burrata (as I do at almost every restaurant that offers it). It comes with half a slice of bread, which isn't really an ideal bread-to-buratta ratio. When I asked for more bread, I was told it would cost 2 dollars extra (for HALF A SLICE OF BREAD!). I still got the bread because I wanted it and I'm not price sensitive to 2 dollars when I'm planning on spending $50+ a person at dinner ...But this is supposed to be a nice place. As someone who orders burrata quite frequently, I can say with some confidence that charging extra for more bread is quite off-market at a place like this. I know I sound like I'm being high-maintenance, but I don't like to feel like I'm being nickel-and-dimed over half a slice of bread when I'm at a restaurant like this lol.

We only orderd 3, and with the pasta tasting it was more than enough. The appetizers were the burrata, the uni, and the scallops--and that's the order of preference in terms of taste and value. Now onto the pasta... The best was the simplest which was the cacio e pepe bucatini. The one I least liked is the chicken liver mini ravioli. The most pretentious pasta is the green one that needed salt and came with a spritz of something I cannot remember nor care for. As for the two desserts that were a part of the tasting, I disliked them both equally. The slightly salted tarragon cream mixed with the ice bits and clementine isn't your typical dessert, and the flavor combination was plain weird.

Maybe he was having a bad day but the dude was off putting.Anyhow, we sit down and check the menu. We decide to get three of the split sides. Cabbage, Olives, and Chickpeas. All of which are decent. Olives in Olive Oil were the best, followed by Chickpeas, then Cabbage. Which was sort of bland.Then the main course I decided to go with Pasta/Egg on top for extra. It was very good.  Didn't blow my hair back but worthy of a decent review. Dad got the Pork Sandwich, which he said was incredible. So much so he didn't even let me have a bite.The bartender is ON POINT.  Made one of the best Old Fashioneds I've had in a long while. Even got the big ice cubes to boot for the drink.

3.0,4/23/2018,"Solid, but underwhelming lunch at Momofuku Nishi. The dishes were creative and with unique, quality ingredients but fell flat in terms of taste and portion size. We tried the spicy long beans, Impossible Burger, Bucatini, and Ravioli. The beans had a nice sauce, but the cold temperature and lack of spice was notable. The Burger had a really interesting texture and flavor, but the bread overwhelmed each bite. Since it was untoasted and also cold, not in a good way. The parmesan crisp was awesome. As for the pastas, the bucatini was perfectly chewy with a nice thick sauce, but I literally finished it in 5 bites. $19 for barely an appetizer-size serving. Lastly, the ravioli was probably our least favorite. The chili honey lime was odd and confusing.

5.0,4/13/2018,"I came here with my friend about a week ago to try some of the delicious and unique foods that are offered here. And I will say start off by saying I was not disappointed. Even though this is an Italian restaurant, I feel like their food has a unique twist to it, compared to other Italian restaurants that I've been to. I kind of get the vibe that they are a rather Asian cuisine inspired because they are a part of the Momofuku branch, but anyway.To the dining experience, our waiter's name was Erik and he was very friendly, very knowledgeable, and explained everything in detail with such ease, he was also very patient with my indecisive ass. All in all he was great!So my friend and I started off with a round of cocktails, which were very good (and quite strong). I first ordered the Love Child, which I loved. It was a nice mixture of sweet and tangy. The second drink I ordered, though, which was the Penicillin, I ended up not really caring for, due to the strange aftertaste it had. However, the head bartender, Rachel was kind enough to make me another drink in place of that one and that's when I tried the Last Bird. That drink was so much better, it was very smooth and uniquely flavored. It was also my first time trying beer syrup, didn't know that was a thing.Now onto the food! The appetizers we ordered were the Burrata, a fresh Italian cheese and their Red Endive. Both were amazing, but I will say the red endive surprised me the most because I was not expecting to like it mainly because I am not a fan of the bitter taste that it is known to have. However, the chef pairs the endive with a sardine type condiment that cancels out the bitterness and adds the perfect amount of flavor to the leafy goodness. It is amazing and definitely worth trying!And as for the main course, my friend and I split the Lobster Fra Diavolo, a pasta dish with, wait for it...one and ahalf pound lobster, that was then fried in some sort of batter and then seasoned with some sort of crack because that dish was heavenly... we also got a complementary order of their infamous Ceci e Pepe, butter noddle with pepper. Very rich and flavorful like everything else I tried! Now I'm not going to lie, but a lot of the food items on the menu are on the pricier side, but you definitely get what you pay for, and that's quality. And lastly, the hostess, Jenny is wonderful! She is very friendly and knows her ish! She's also a great conversationalist and very easy to talk to.

The strega sour is like a ginned up version of a pisco sour and is delicious.  The last bird is a fantastic rum drink.  The drinks are small and pricey, so that's a minus, but they're very well made.  All in all a great meal.  Expensive to do the tasting menu, and next time I'll probably just order the bread and the bucatini on its own.",1,0,0,Danny O.,"Manhattan, NY",12,139,0

4.0,3/24/2018,"This is my first David Chang Momofuku experience. Nishi's a modern fusion take on Italian food. Great service throughout the meal. Let's cut to the chase -- food. For two of us, the bill came out to be $150. I didn't expect for it to be this expensive, but glad to have tried it out. Endive salad - very different than any appetizers I've had. It's sharp and vinegary. It's a great and light appetizer to start with. Cece e pepe - this is as good as the hype. You'll see this on every table at the restaurant. I didn't find out til later that the dish is cheese free! It's made from ground chick pea... I couldn't even tell. The pasta's cooked al dente and it was so deep in flavor. Steak - it was fine, a little underwhelming. The cauliflower purée it was paired with was a treat but I've had better steak. Stick with the pastas. Potatoes - wow! Crispy, tender, and flavorful. I'm not sure what it's sautéed with but man, that was delicious. Olive oil cake - pretty good but wouldn't order again. It's moist and heavy and it's not too sweet which is nice. Drinks - their wine and alcohol list is extensive. However each whisky was $20, so it's pricey.

There are definitely plenty of places I can go to if I want pasta that tastes way better for the same price or even less. I also tried the impossible burger again. Since I was last here, the impossible burger is now featured more prominently on the menu with 3 variations (before it was just do you want to add cheese), and each preparation costs a whopping $18. I really liked this burger the last time I was here, but this time we tried two different preparations and both were dry.

5.0,2/25/2018,"I've been here twice now and the first time, our 5 year anniversary dinner, was a bit of a 3 star experience, but our second time was all the stars! The service was amazing both times (thanks especially to Alexis who is an expert and creative mixologist and knew everything about every dish and explained it with such warmth and enthusiasm). The decor is cosy, and the food the second time was just spectacular. The cocktails the first time we went were a bit uninspired, but the second time we tried a new rum concoction with bitters as well as a spicy tequila daiquiri (if that makes any sense) and both were exactly what I want from a cocktail - complex and yummy and interesting. I don't know if either were on the menu, but you can ask them to make you something if you don't see something you want immediately (sorry but I'm that kind of annoying cocktail lover) (warning: they are pricy for how delicious they are). Everything is plated beautifully. I'll just mash up everything we had on both visits so please don't be alarmed at the number of dishes (also we sort of over-ordered the second time). Sides and apps: The endive salad was a bit on the vinegary side, but interesting and crunchy. The beet and citrus salad combines two of my favourite things and balanced each other perfectly (and topped with shaved frozen ricotta - such a lovely detail). The kale and mushroom side was hearty and healthy and delicious. The mackerel on toast was absolutely GREAT (I'd highly recommend this). Not sure if this is the same as the fried shrimp dish on their menu but we got young shrimp (can be eaten whole) which was out of this world - I could eat a colony of these. We also had a side of sun chokes (the roots of sunflowers wut?) which were fried and crunchy and amazing (especially dipped in the green sauce of the branzino dish). Pastas: There was a bucatini pasta dish made with a chickpea sauce which was comfort food satisfying, but not that special. There was a ravioli dish which was very good (but testing the limits of my lactose intolerance - I took 4 pills and happily ate a few). The spaghetti dish with uni and peppers was excellent - creamy and yummy and with chewy bits of uni that made it interesting. Mains: The skate main was overcooked and bony and bland, and the whole branzino was a tiny bit fishy tasting. Overall I haven't been super taken with their fish mains, but my partner demolished the branzino so it may just be me on the latter.Dessert: This last is rare for me (I'm not big on sweets), but I think the dessert might have been the best thing. We got a frozen vanilla mousse because it was said to be light (like I said, we over-ordered) and it really was light, and delicious - we scraped the plate it was so good. It had amaro (a digestive liquor) and was topped with black lime which is basically charcoal blackened bits of lime which made it look insane but was such an interesting inventive combination of flavors! We also had the pistachio bundt which was good but in a regular kind of way that paled against the mousse and charcoal. Thank you to the managers at Momofuku Nishi who invited us back to try them again, and our lovely attentive servers, and so many kudos to the chef.

4.0,2/20/2018,"Originally, we thought that their would be a fusion/asian flavor to the dishes. We ordered the bucatini, fusilli, pappardelle and the chitara. I will say that normally I am always a fan of pappardelle because they is usually a savoury meat (i.e. Short Rib) with the dish. But the bucatini was definitely the BEST out of the bunch. We could not figure out what was in it because they told us there was no cheese at all but was so buttery and creamy. Definitely a must try!We also went with a few of the Antipastis. The radishes & bagna cauda was definitely our favorite. Pro-tip: we ordered the spicy cabbage thinking it would be something special. Turns out it was just normal kimchi (almost seemed like it came out of a jar), so we were disappointed in that. However, our server was beyond amazing.

2.0,2/13/2018,"I understand the menu items was intended to create a Asian-Italian-American fusion yet modern food experience, but it really just doesn't work the way Momofuku Nishi does it. We visited a couple months ago, ordered the chicken ramen with pickled napa cabbage and sichuan-styled chili oil noodles. The chicken ramen was beyond bizarre. Don't get me wrong, I love both ramen and Northern Chinese pickled napa cabbage, and I get pretty creative and adventurous in terms of mixing various Asian food concepts, but Momofuku really has failed on such a dish. Yes, the fusion of the two dishes did create complexity and a new flavor, but the two really just don't go well together. Instead of providing a ""wow"" moment, it gave us a ""hmm.. interesting."" In the end, it was still edible, therefore the 2 stars. The Szechuan-styled chili oil noodles were unimpressive, but at least they didn't mess with the flavors as much.This dish also lacked fresh ingredients such as proteins or fresh produce. So far, the review has nothing to do with price and value yet, but if you take the prices and value into consideration, this place would be your classic overpriced, branded, celebrity chef-owned restaurant.

Be it pasta, steak, or just over my mouth, please keep shaving off that black truffle magic right into my belly!That pretty much sums up my first dinner at Momofuku Nishi. And while I left the restaurant a little heavier, and my wallet a lot lighter, I must say the experience was worth every single penny.It was around 6pm on Friday the 13th. My friend and I needed dinner before heading out to Willamsburg Music Hall for scary music night with the mysterious Lustmord. We walked past Momofuku Nishi, both of us realizing, ""hey, isn't this supposed to be a really good restaurant?"" So we walked in. We were told that they were booked for the evening, but if we could finish by 7pm, we could have a table immediately. The timing was perfect.We got right down to business. This would be a rampage eating and drinking style of meal. I started with the Via Averna cocktail: rye whiskey, amaro, contratto, and orange bitters. It was delicious, but at $17, you don't want a cocktail that goes down this fast. For an appetizer, we started with the sourdough foccacia and an order of the bucatini ceci e pepe to split. Although not as good as my favorite cacio e pepe, it was pretty darn good. ""Would you like black truffles shaved on your bucatini, sir?"" Why, yes, of course.When the question is ""truffles?"" The answer is always ""yes.""For the main event, I ordered a special sliced Wagyu strip steak they were serving. Served extra medium rare, but with a perfect sear on the outside. ""Would you like black truffles shaved on your steak, sir?"" YES YES YES. This was a night of sheer gluttony. Everything was amazing.The name of this place confuses me. When I saw ""Momofuku"" I was expecting Asian food of some sort -- sushi, ramen, etc. That I ended up having one of the best plates of Italian-style pasta and one of the best steaks I've ever eaten, was a most welcome surprise.I can't wait to come back.

We were greeted with a smile and our waiter (Devin) was very knowledgable, accommodating, and attentive. We had a reservation for 8:45 p.m. and the restaurant was moderately crowded at that time.The menu has a wide array of options based off of Italian classics but with a Momofuku twist. The ceci e pepi uses Momofuku's chickpea Hozon in the place of parmesan cheese. It is rich and delicious. Their homemade pasta has perfect consistency and is very satisfying. The fontina polenta looked like a savoury creme brûlée, and tasted amazing. It was smooth, creamy, and had a bit of charred taste. The kale with mushrooms was perfectly cooked and flavoured. The beet and citrus salad was refreshing, but not overly exciting. Momofuku Nishi can accommodate vegetarians nicely. They have two pasta items on the menu that are naturally vegetarian, and some dishes have meat items that can be left off (such as the polenta). They also have a nice drink menu. Momofuku Nishi is a great place to go if you are looking for Italian food with an unusual twist.

I did the pasta tasting menu with the bolognese replacing the duck course because I'm not a duck fan. The cacio was good but it's not real cacio and you can tell - give me all the cheese!  The stuffed pasta in broth was good but the horseradish in the broth was unexpected and overwhelming. The chicken liver and bolognese were good but not great. The first dessert, which comes looking very much like the lucky peach logo, was AMAZING though....I could have eaten 5 of those!  The second dessert was decent but nothing to write home about. The waitress made me a delicious nonalcoholic drink that made my pregnant self feel like I was drinking alcohol so that was appreciated!  Overall, I'd say Italian is just not David's forte sadly....but I'll still eat all his other foods any day of the week!",0,0,0,Sarah H.,"Echo Park, Los Angeles, CA",201,51,56
4.0,2/6/2018,"**Review for RW Winter 2018**Modern, casual American restaurant, mostly known for their burgers I believe. My friend and I wanted to try a momofuku nishi for RW lunch and we are so glad we did! Appetizer: Marinated beet salad - AMAZING. Beet was very sweet and plump, marinated in amazing vinaigrette with sunflower seeds. Perfect way to start the meal. My friend got the sourdough focaccia with honey ricotta and looked decadent. She enjoyed it a lot!Main: Atlantic char - meat-y fish with lots of flavor. Cooked really well and loved the accompanying tomato soup. So glad we got this.Dessert: if we didn't have enough of good food, the olive oil cake was amazing. Cake was very moist and the condensed milk drizzle was to die for. Not too sweet and really good with coffee.One of the best, if not the best, RW I have tried in NY. I have tried a handful and often experienced a combo of subpar food and suboptimal service. Momofuku Nishi really does reflect their normal menu offerings and staff. Can't wait til I come back to try for their regular menu offerings.",6,1,4,Janet J.,"New York, NY",330,204,380
5.0,2/5/2018,"Having been a fan of all things Momofuku I have been dying to try this place. A family dinner presented a great opportunity. The meal was spectacular from the get go. The staff is incredibly attentive and knowledgeable. I found myself eating things I might of not ordered because of their passion and they were right. We started with some of the salads red endive, shaved celery and apple with fresh mozz and mackerel toast. Mackerel has never been a must for me but their iteration of a classic shrimp toast was mind blowing.The pastas are on another level. We had the bucatini Cacio de Pepe which has no cheese apparently. It was game changing. The spaghetti with uni was also wonderfully delightful.Entrees are great and perfect to share. We had the Bronzino which was solid. The Pork though was some of the best I've ever had while dining out. Simple and beautifully cooked. Basically. Believe the hype.

The clam pasta was amazing, the noodles were toasted and oily and delicious and the spaghetti was so rich and spicy and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The steak was also cooked perfect but was just a dense piece of meat and the polenta was super heavy. The branzino was super light and delicious, it was served in a green dashi that really imparted flavor onto the fish.

It popped with hot creamy goodness in your mouth as a tasty surprise. The dish only came with 5 pieces, and although rich in flavor I could have eaten 10-15 pieces. They do not offer this pasta outside of the tasting menu. We also ordered the Boston mackerel toasts with piquillo peppers and salsa verde, which were also a WINNER. Delicious combination of flavors. If you want more pasta for your money, order the regular pasta dishes, but if you want a variety, I would spring for the pasta tasting (4 total) which also came with two desserts.",0,0,0,Erin C.,"New York, NY",190,160,177

I felt mixed with euphoria but also disappointment and humiliation when I had one of the pastas. RESERVATIONS. Kind of insane. By Fri, 7PM my friend said the earliest dinner reservation was 8:45PM. By the time he registered for an Open table account, the earliest jumped to 9:45 PM. Not sure if this is normal and exactly the hype throughout all momofuku restaurants.FOOD. I ordered the pasta tasting ($58) for the two of us, which consisted of the bucatini (cece e pepe), tortellini of porcini mushrooms and chive, agnolotti... all were very impressive and flavorful (can't decide which is more orgasmic in the mouth) until we had the next pasta: some twist on seemingly Chinese dish I can't remember that honestly tasted more like cheap Chinese takeout.Honestly, it was as if we were at our peak with all the last dish. Not sure if it was experimental, or what. But Momofuku Nishi redeemed the overall experience for us because the earlier dishes were that great and the pistachio gelato topped it off. The portions weren't huge, but with all the ingredients and richness, I left with a content appetite.

The cocktails are fine, but not worth 16 to 20 dollars a pop, even though they are strong. The mezzaluna pasta was tasty, but in no way worth 22 dollars for six pieces.

I would expect a fine dining price tag for such awesome food and it really would be worth it, the fact you can get a filling pasta tasting course for just $58 is incredible.

2.0,12/18/2017,"Ugh - what a disappointing meal.  Had high hopes and was so let down by the end.  We did the pasta tasting menu with wine pairings.  Here are the highlights:- TINY portions.  My husband and I do not have particularly large appetites, but the portion sizes relative to ordering the same pastas off the menu was offensive.  For one dish they literally gave us 5 less-than-bite-sized ravioli.  We had to order another dish at the end of the meal because we were still hungry.  - Spotty service.  I always try to prioritize food above service when reviewing a restaurant.  But particularly for a tasting menu (and particularly particularly with wine pairings), the service can make or break the meal.  There were long lulls in between courses...20-25 min.  But they poured the wine pairing immediately...so by the time the food arrived we had already finished the (lackluster) wine.  - Bland pastas.  The second course (it was a mushroom ravioli) was fantastic (all 5 bites of it), but everything else was disappointingly bland.  The ceci e pepe, so prevalent on social media, was a HUGE disappointment.  They swapped pecorino for chickpea flour...and the salty deliciousness of the cheese went with it.  It looked pretty on the plate but was frustratingly bland and floury.  - The desserts were A JOKE.  My husband and I didn't even eat them (notable given we were still hungry).  The first was a tiny portion of panna cotta with a weird ice on it and some sort of soy sauce reduction.  NOT the panna cotta on the regular menu.  The second dessert was an ice cream sandwich thing that was so horrible we both took one bite and said ""you've got to be effing kidding me"" and tossed it aside.  This is what the owners of Milk Bar give me??

The waiter suggested that we eat the entire shrimp with head and shell in tact. We did and to our surprise it tasted very good! They are seasoned perfectly and the shells and heads had the same consistency of soft shell crab. For the entree(s) we had the Bucatini Ceci e Pepe which was prepared perfectly! It was full of flavor and tasted peppery and buttery. The noodles were cooked al dente and they were tender and doughy! We also had the Black Bass with shaved black truffles over the top.

3.0,9/30/2017,"A lot of pros and cons going on here. Overall the food is mostly great, with a few head scratchers. But the ambiance is just crap - the place is wildly uncomfortable and usually freezing cold. And they just have some really weird and annoying ways of doing things here. For example, if you order the Impossible Burger (which by the way, is designed to be kind of like a standard American burger with simple fries - they even put a little American flag in the bun) you have to ask to have any condiments with it. Then they look surprised (like whoa, who tf would want ketchup with fries?!!?) and it takes forever to get them so you either eat your burger and fries without or stare at them while they get cold. So I started asking for the condiments when I order it, which didn't work until I started telling them to bring the condiments out before the burger came. So yeah, finally after ten visits or so I figured out how to get ketchup with my fries, but I still have to deal with them looking surprised.Other weird thing - they don't have any functioning knives. It's basically a regular butter knife or a butter knife with a wooden handle. Both of which are dull and don't cut anything. So if you want to share something with someone you can just go f yourself instead. And I say this because it's not the lack of cutlery which is most annoying, but it's them acting surprised that you want a knife and them insisting that you should just use this silly butter knife because that's completely normal.I imagine these all seem like petty little things but when you keep going to a place and they keep being weird and keep charging you more, it's hard not to react.So I guess go to Momofuku Nishi for the food but expect to drop some cash and not be treated especially nice. The butter noodles are really, really good so at least there's that.Because it's always so cold the food always gets cold quickly.They keep changing (aka raising) their prices.

5.0,9/30/2017,"I was on Mission Impossible...Burger! I only had two days in NYC but I was getting my hands on one of these famous burgers. As a vegetarian for almost a decade and becoming somewhat of a connoisseur on veggie burgers, this burger was definitely the best I ever had! (*cue Drake music*) We had a 3 hour commute home but it was so good that I was seriously considering smuggling one in my purse for later. The supply is limited and unfortunately only served at lunchtime so if want one, you need to fight for it.  All the meat eaters at the table were skeptical but even  the veggie haters had to admit it was good. I personally found it to be a bit greasy, however, the taste was great and the texture is probably the closest you can get to meat. If that wasn't enough, they purposefully make it look like the burger is ""bleeding"". Do not miss out on this burger, guys. It's famous for a reason!",8,4,9,Huyen D.,"Houston, TX",871,259,665

This particular menu has few items, but the choices aren't limited! It almost feels like he's saying, if you can't find anything here, then go - you don't deserve to eat here. My three co-diners all got the ceci e pepe which is not like what you'd get in Italy (as one of my friends got recently in Rome), but it is creamy and tasty. I had the toasted noodle which was delicious. Great texture and taste. Everyone liked my dish best. I think these are the two best entrees. We also shared the potatoes with an egg yolk. Again, unique and good. For appetizers, we had beet and avocado, heirloom tomato & raw beef. All good. One problem: it was a muggy NYC night and the A/C was on of course. For some reason water dripped on us from the condensation. Most unpleasant to be talking or eating and suddenly to have 2-3 drops of ice cold water hit you.

They ask if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions right away. The server walks you through the menu, very knowledgable and helpful with answers to any questions.  We ate a lot of food. And everything is meant to be shared. The whole fried shrimp. Scared me at first but the taste and seasoning was wonderful. You eat the entire shrimp- head, tail, eyes and all.  The cucumber and scallop crudo was perfect.  Light and refreshing. Great flavors. the scallops were soft so the cucumber added great little crunch. We also had the mackerel. Nicely flavored with ginger. Probably my favorite out of the first three apps we shared. Moving on...We enjoyed romain with anchovies, vin, and walnuts. Very good. Heirloom tomatoes and homemade tofu. I did not try this because I'm impartial to tomatoes, however my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed this dish. We split this amazing, top selling pasta dish.  It was the cacio e pepe. Def recommend if you come here.  We also had the clam dish with toasted noodles and oregano. The toasted noodles were amazing. Very tasty.  After all that we had the fried kimchee pancake.

The tl;dr is probably that it tries to capitalize on the yuppie trend of having wood tables and glasses and an urban aesthetic justify the prices rather than the food. The peppers and sauce were okay, nothing special. The impossible burger was pretty cool. However, the feature is in the niche and not the taste. The portions of these items were rather small, even for lunch.  These items were probably average, hence the rating. Nothing special.  The most egregious offender of this, however, is the Ceci, which seeks to charge 20 for its very overspiced and oversalted pasta. Not only is the dish not worth getting, but it was somewhat a chore to finish.  I got through 3 glasses of water before I finished it. And I was sharing.

4.0,4/24/2017,"Dinner review.With my visit to Momofuku Nishi, I've officially been to all of David Chang's restaurants in NYC.  Nishi ranks second on the list, right after Momofuku Ko (which in reality, is on a whole 'nother level).  I was pleased with the unique options on the menu, as well as with the atmosphere and service.  This is most definitely a family-style/tapas kind of place, so it's best to order several dishes and share.  We were a group of 3, and 6 dishes fed us exactly right.Atmosphere was good - not too chatty, there was plenty of natural light, and the space was fairly open and you didn't feel cramped at all.  Service was excellent - I found our waiter to be very friendly and chatty.. he actually seemed like he gave a damn and he wasn't just there to do his job and go home. We got the following dishes for dinner:- Diver scallops - I liked the neon green sauce - tangy and flavorful.  The raw scallops were fresh and went well with the sauce and cucumber.  Made for a beautiful IG picture, in case anyone cares about that... ha!- Raw beef - the addition of the tangy watermelon radish was clutch.  Really liked this beef carpaccio-type dish... probably one of the best raw beef dishes I've had in recent memory.- Romaine salad - of all the dishes we got, this was probably my least favorite.  However, the 2 guys I was with actually loved this salad.... and they hate salad, so maybe it's just me.  They recommend that you eat these with your hands.... it was weird, but interesting.- Ribs (special) - very, very peppery, but I liked the sweet and sour sauce.  The meat was tender.  However, I felt this tasted slightly like pastrami and the black pepper was way too overpowering.- Flat Noodle - spicy beef, mint, crispy shallot - oh man, this was my favorite of the bunch.  A unique take on an Italian pappardelle pasta dish.  The noodles were cooked to absolute perfection and the beef sauce was amazing and had the perfect amount of spiciness to it.  I  would get this again!- Fried potato and smoked yolk - these were surprisingly good, and I don't usually like potatoes.  They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The salty yolk was basically a sauce substitute.  Yum!In my opinion, Nishi is worth a visit, especially for dinner.  Come for lunch if you really want the Impossible Burger, but I don't think you can judge this place solely on that.  The unique and interesting takes on typical dishes here are what makes Nishi special.  Yum!",11,3,7,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

I do, however, have complaints with the food. One of my dishes  came out lukewarm and for the price of these plates, I would have liked them to come out hot. My guest and I ordered the Mackeral tataki (15), spicy beef pasta (21) and the branzino (25). I wasn't a huge fan of the mackeral tataki or the spicy beef pasta but the branzino was actually very good. I really enjoyed the sunchokes with the branzino and the fish was very tender.

The butter noodles with meatballs were phenomenal, but I'd pass on the jajangmyeon, which tasted like something I could have ordered for a much lower price in Korea or China town.

I ate a beef burger at Shake Shack beforehand to make sure I wasn't fooling myself when it comes to the taste. The IB is pretty standard; a bun, lettuce, cheese, sauce. The usual.How does it taste?Like a thin skirt steak that's been lightly fried at the edges. I think that's delicious. However, it is pretty thin because otherwise the price would be even more outrageous.Does it bleed? You might have heard that the Impossible Burger can bleed, and be cooked from rare to well-done. True, but not here. Due to pricing constraints, the burgers are all thin and thus only able to be cooked one way. As the process improves, I expect the price to drop and the variety in cooking styles to expand.The takeaway: As a proof of concept, it succeeds admirably. It's a vegetarian burger that actually tastes like meat, and tasty to boot. That said, it's pricy for what amounts to a regular burger. Eat it for the novelty, eat it for the environment, eat it because it's tasty.Don't eat it if you are looking for bang for your buck. (Not yet anyways.)",1,0,0,Carlos G.,"San Jose, CA",20,377,72

Service was impeccable; case in point, we sat next to two women, one of whom found a hair in her burger. She informed her server, who was extremely apologetic and offered her another. She declined since she was full, and after the server took it away, multiple people came by to apologize for the issue with the meal. The manager also came by to offer her and her partner free dessert and both of their meals on the house. It was the best service I've seen to account for a pretty tiny issue, and I was really impressed.Unfortunately, the Impossible Burger itself was just meh. Fake meat patty was thin and while it tasted similar to meat, it was so little squished under so many toppings that you couldn't really taste anything.

3.0,1/19/2017,"Just writing on the Impossible Burger. Was in the neighborhood so i tried it. People are flocking to this place to try this thing. There was a line when i got there but i sat at the bar as i walked through i noticed almost 100% of the patrons had the $14 burger. The only question is: to cheese or not i chose to cheese and it's American cheese or nothing. I am aware that they are really controlling how this burger is presented and they must have tried other cheeses and this was the winner. Seems curious to me to only offer that cheese. The meat fraud arrived and it looked just as advertised, you just cant make a plant look more like beef and still be edible. A warm hats off to the chemist and/or lab technicians who toiled over this project, Dr. Frankenstein would be so proud. So how did it taste? Well, it has a salty somewhat tinny taste to start. As your eating your thinking meat, but something is just not quite right, the taste does not linger and collect in your mind like beef. I really didn't think the pattie was presented hot enough, maybe it was so busy at this time of day, or maybe thats exactly how they want to serve it. Not sure. I would have preferred hotter. The imposter came about 5 minutes after i ordered so I'm leaning toward the latter. Bottom line is Its one of the better veggie burgers you'll find other than that thing at Pensy, which for my money, is better, it may not look as much like beef, but its just plain tastier.

Must select a really flattering filter for this on Instagram.It did taste pretty good though, and the very meat-like similarity is impressive.Until you realized you paid $12 for an adult happy meal that doesn't come with a toy.All jokes aside, the Impossible Burger is definitely worthwhile to try once.

We wandered around Chelsea as we waited, our final wait time clocking in at about 45 minutes.The restaurant is sleek, modern, minimalistic. There were real cut flowers in vases on the tables, which was a really nice touch and pop of color. We already knew what we wanted before we came here (the Impossible Burger), so we were able to order immediately. There were many patrons in the restaurant, with again crowded seating like the Momofuku Noodle Bar establishment so conversation was hard to have without shouting at the other person. Our burgers came out pretty quickly, and although the idea was cool (bleeding burger, anyone?!) it honestly wasn't anything I would recommend someone else having. The bread was dry (think supermarket level hamburger bun, although I'm sure it wasn't very cheap at all), the lettuce was sad and wilted, and the cheese plain and unremarkable. There were an INSANE amount of fries that came with our orders too, but they were also just okay. I do give them props for the Momofuku Ssam sauce, as that was actually a really good addition to both my burger and as a dipping sauce for my fries.

This burger just took my breath away.  Not only does it look like beef, have the texture of meat  and smells like it, it actually tastes like it too.  If someone did not tell me I was eating 100% plant matter I would not know nor would I believe them.  Yes folks it was that good.  This could convert more people to vegetarianism than anything else.Since this is the only restaurant in the tristate area serving the ""Imposisble Burger"" the reason for the deadline is obvious.  If they sold it during dinner no one would order anything else.",0,0,0,G T.,"Manhattan, NY",21,11,0

I couldn't believe the sweet, buttery taste was from the chickpea hozon. It was absolutely delicious, but the portion size a bit on the small side.- Jajangmyeon - it was a little spicy but also tasty- Buterscotch bundt cake - this dessert was really delicious.

4.0,11/6/2016,"The bad thing about the Impossible Burger only being offered during lunch/brunch is that I didn't get to try it at dinner last night. The good thing is that I suspect this somewhat drives down demand for dinner here. One evening prior to our dinner on a Friday at 6:45 pm, we were easily able to make reservations.So the burger thing was disappointing, but I still got to try the Butter Noodle (chickpea hozon, black pepper). As most people looking at this page have probably ascertained, butter noodle [formerly ceci e pepe] is a riff on the classic Romani dish cacio e pepe. There are certainly noticeable similarities: the piquancy of the pepper, the perfectly al dente linguini (I think?) noodles. But the flavor of the chickpea hozon and the buttery flavor give it a umami spin that is all its own. It neither improves upon nor detracts from the original dish; it pays homage to its close relative but does its own thing. It's perfect. My boyfriend had the spicy beef noodle (shells, mint, crispy shallots). I don't eat beef, but a tried a pasta shell. I certainly couldn't get a grasp on the entire dish just from one noodle, but just from that one bite, I wasn't really impressed.To round out the meal, we had an appetizer (diver scallops -  tomatillo, shio kombu, tiger's milk). The dish featured delicate flavors and small scallops. We both enjoyed it, but not sure it was $17-good. I also had a cocktail: the blood orange daiquiri. While it was a good cocktail, it didn't really pair well with the butter noodle. Our waitress said that one appetizer and two noodle dishes would be enough for two people, but even though we are not huge eaters, we still wanted something more, and the soy creme brûlée hit the spot. Even with the dessert, though, we weren't totally stuffed. The brûlée was another example of a play on a classic dish. The texture here was different -  less like custard and more like, say, apple butter - as were the flavors, with vanilla and a hint of ginger. We both agreed that we wouldn't ALWAYS want to have this in place of regular creme brûlée, but sometimes, absolutely.I don't have much to say about the decor or the service, both of which take a backseat to the food.4.5 stars - 5+ for the butter noodle, 3 for the scallops, 4 for everything else.",1,1,1,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",341,548,34

Fave dish of the 4 we ordered was the spicy beef.  Interesting mashup... spicybeef with green shellpasta made with mint, topped with #crispyshallots.  Yum.  Shells were perfectly aldente.  Kick was weak, so if you like a little heat, ask for their house made hot sauce to pair!  We expected a soup with the scallops dish, but the chef thought it was wasteful as many guests are not consuming it. So now, it is only trickled onto the scallops... I wonder what the flavor would have been had the soup come at us full-on as like in previous photos.

By the time the store opened at 12 there was 10 people waiting. Packed house in 20 minutes. Famous for their Impossible burger and we could tell why after the first bite. Crunchy and soft bun, not the typical American hamburger bun. Reminded me of Asian bbq bun dough. The all-plant based patty was moist and actually tasted like real meat. Came with a bit of lettuce, tomato, pickles, and a squirt of sauce. You can ask for more sauce and ketchup. Fries was a good amount and crispy, not overly oily.Overall, very good vegan burger and fries. Best out there, that bf got 2 $14 a piece.",9,2,2,Sharon L.,"San Francisco, CA",235,98,200

Unfortunately I soon realized I need to calm the f down. Because while I love the fusion menu, the vibe of the restaurant brings me back to why I hate eating out in many quote-unquote hot spots in NYC these days.  Let's start with pretentious waitstaff, the kind that makes you wait for the sake of waiting to keep the mystery of the place alive-- rather than taking a down to earth approach. Then after waiting 25 minutes for a table after 10 pm we were finally seated at the end of the bar by 10:30 with many open seats around us. The humorless bartender served us a good margarita and the yummy food came out with austere solemnity but considering the wait, price tag and attitude, the food comes at a premium. I mean the food is good, the drinks are good but the vibe is nyc circa 2006 when bank accounts were fat and so were egos. Obvy, this is not the era in which we live -- and certainly doesn't fit in this hood-  so let's be for realzies. Why not  make momofuko a cool neighborhood joint with an easy vibe and inventive food that wants to be an accessible neighborhood joint? I would go back for that.",0,0,0,Lena R.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

4.0,10/2/2016,"The most impressed I've been with a Momofuku meal! While everything at Nishi lives up to its name, the Impossible Burger from Impossible Foods is the most impressive item. It looks just like an In-N-Out Burger. Comes made with straightforward toppings on a soft bun. Lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese (optional). Patty is grilled thin, so you get delicious, crispy edges and a soft center. It's unlike any other vegetarian burger on the market (as far as I know) and is on the same competing level with a beef burger. Honestly, I would choose it over a beef burger.The Limocello slushi with yuzu is also amazing. It tastes like a spiked lemon-flavored water ice. Chew a bit of the leaf garnish before drinking, to enhance the flavor. The korean pancake made with squash isn't memorable, but the Bitter Greens & Vegetarian XO salad is pretty good. The bitter greens salad has some very tasty, sweet endives in it. As for the entree dishes, I tried the Spicy Beef Noodles and Jajangmyeon. Jajangmyeon is typically made with a sweet black bean sauce, but Nishi makes it salty. It tastes more like Chinese-style black bean sauce. The saltiness balances out with the lighter tasting side dishes, though (the Squash Pancake and the Bitter Greens salad). On the opposite end, the Spicy Beef noodle is on the sweet side. It's a unique taste (a fuku take on the sweet chili taste) that may not appeal to everyone. The dish is made with green pasta shells and is reflective of the Italian-Korean fusion theme. For dessert, a slice of the Pistachio bundt cake. The icing is killer sweet (beware!) and the ricotta cream is thick (reminded me of sour cream). It's not bad if you scrape off the icing, but I'd pass on it next time. The staff were knowledgeable (our waiter answered any questions we had about the dishes and even provided some details on an artwork near the kitchen). A reservation would be best, but walk-in is possible during dinner hours (if you are a small group of 2-3).",1,0,2,Leny K.,"Philadelphia, PA",100,34,167

3.0,9/29/2016,"This is a more interesting restaurant than reviewers gave it credit for. It is also not all that uncomfortable--a lot of restaurants across town have similarly awkward seating and poor acoustics. The negativity seems directed more at taking Chang down a notch than at anything so seriously wrong with this restaurant. The jajangmyeon and the ocean trout are stand out dishes. The butter noodles (formerly ceci e pepe) are good comfort food, though the innovative use of ""hozon"" is debatable in terms of what it is adding to the dish. The raw beef is also very good and smart visual plating. Fried whole shrimp and the deceptively simple ""romaine"" are addictive. The squid noodles with xo are weak, a one note dish with the xo barely coming through. I rarely leave food but did not finish this dish. The ""vegetarian xo"" greens as a side dish are even weaker, with the funky umami flavors of XO totally absent in this rendition. The mackerel small plate is average. Cocktails are average. Some choices, like the cider, are poor. The Impossible Burger is a smart business decision but I did not care to try it. Almost every table had it on their plate even though it wasn't on the dinner menu. Some of the ideas at play in the food here are interesting. Few of them are ""Italian.""

Definitely has the same good, fatty grease taste and texture as a proper meat burger should. Fries were fries.Jajangmyeon was sweet, savory, and a bit salty but delicious nonetheless. Squash pancakes with vinegar is ideal for a side - not too much of a vinegar taste. Bitter Vegetables with XO is decent.Favorite dish however was the spicy beef with pasta shells, crispy shallots, etc. Sweet and savory - I personally can't describe it but I loved it. If you enjoy Korean BBQ, this is the dish to get. There was a quote by David Chang: ""That's how I feel about food. Different cultures may use different media to express those base patterns--with different ingredients, for instance, depending on what's available. But they are, at heart, doing the exact same thing. They are fundamentally playing the same music. And if you can recognize that music, you'll blow people's minds with a paradox they can taste: the new and the familiar woven together in a strange loop."" I felt it was realized here in this dish.Limoncello slushie with yuzu is what it is: the perfect alcoholic drink in the summer (not exactly a beach drink though).Bundt cake wasn't anything too special but we finished it.

The butter noodles (Cacio e Pepe) are as amazing as all the reviews say. The jjajjangmyeon was too salty and not my favorite (although I assume I'm biased since I love the real dish). The trout was well cooked but the sauce/broth was a strange mixture of sour and savory so I didn't enjoy it. The tomato appetizer was okay - nothing too special. All in all, Cacio e Pepe and chicken were the only highlights and everything else wasn't as special as I hoped. Service was good but half a point off for food, half a point off for how loud it was (hard to scream an enjoyable dinner convo), and a point off for their no-tipping policy being rescinded without any announcement.

Sadly, the restaurant is still abusingly loud and a terrible value. Charging $19 for butter noodles (formerly the ceci e pepe) is hefty enough. But $23 for a fistful of lo mein with gochujang and XO sauce is practical criminal. I mean, this is grease food you make when you're it's 2am and you're starving and there's nothing left in the fridge but an old box of sunchang and a half eaten packet of noodles. And you already ordered Domino's last night. Babbo's linguine with clams and hot chiles (which is overrated already) is only $19 and practically a steal in comparison. $27 for a few strips of fatty pork? Ok, the pork went well with the pastrami spice, touch of smoke and the low heat treatment. But I had to fork over $11 for a side of potatoes that should've just been paired with the dish. $140 for two happy hour drinks, an appetizer, two pastas, an entree and a side? Chang, are you trying to start Buddakan? Did the meatpacking move to 22nd and 8th? The one aspect of Nishi that isn't overhyped is the noise level. Did I mention it gets very loud in there? It's like walking into Off the Wagon during NYU move in weekend, except you can't run away after a PBR. If you're seeking Asian-inspired Italian, you can do so much better at Basta Pasta.

Not good. Butter Noodles were good, enjoyable but not anything spectacular. Spicy Beef was inedible, so spicy and greasy.

3.0,9/9/2016,"Went for the Impossible Burger a few weeks ago - and yes, it was amazing. I've been vegetarian for the past 2.5 years so I can't directly compare it to meat but it tastes pretty much exactly like I remember. Super yummy! It was a little small for $12, but I expected to pay more for such a new invention. That being said, the Impossible burger was the best part of our visit, and note that Momofuku did not invent that, so I only give them partial credit (for cooking it). The rest of the things (service, atmosphere, other parts of meal) that were Momofuku's responsibility all fell flat:-the fries. They're like McDonald's fries, pretty much exactly. Seriously, you're going to serve frozen fries with a culinary masterpiece like the Impossible burger? Seriously unforgivable and just....why?! So confusing on a place that's clearly pretentious about its menu, and considering the Momofuku hype I don't know how this happened. -the offerings with the Impossible burger: so you're gonna offer a vegan burger and charge extra for a vegan bun? What the-???!! Not okay. Not even asking for vegan cheese (which really should have been offered), but that's not acceptable. I can't be the only vegan annoyed by this. Unfortunately I'm lactose intolerant so having dairy makes me sick - part of the reason I'm vegan and go out of the way for vegan dishes like the Impossible burger. When I have to pay extra, it's very frustrating! -the service. Ok, the service was fine, but they seemed a little annoyed and curt that we only wanted the burger (all 3 of us). Also, despite the fact that there were many, many tables open, we had to wait at the window for the 3rd member of our party to arrive, even though she was a block away. They wouldn't seat us until she was physically there. All in all, Momofuku Nishi seems a little too enamored with its own undeserved hype.

This is without a doubt the worst dining stop during my visit to New York.Our group was seated on the high top tables and offered our choice of water upon sitting. Behind us there was a chalkboard with the option to do a larger family style entree but you needed to order over 24 hours something like 48? in advanced... overkill I think, but whatever. I'm not the one cooking. Disappointed to learn about this option AFTER we had already been seated.Perused the menu and was once again.. disappointed in the lack of choices. 4 noodles and 2 entrees? I understand wanting to keep the menu concise but seriously.. Appetizer was the raw beef which was pretty good. Entree wise we had:butter noodles: good but you can definitely get better cacio e pepe elsewhere and at a much larger portion. Jajangmyeon: black bean sauce tasted weird to me. Definitely can find better at a hole in the wall in koreatown.Spicy Beef: was just okay. Definitely had a kick to it and a decent amount of beef but.. i just didn't really care much for it and wound up tossing most my entree. They did top the entire surface with fried garlic so that was a nice crunch. Also ordered the potatoes. Without a doubt, my FAVORITE part of the meal. Tasty tasty little spuds. Overall, food wise, I don't think portion and price point were right. Entire group felt the same.. Maybe because we're from texas but I don't think a tiny plate of spaghetti with peppers warrants a $19 price tag. Service wasn't bad, but definitely not worthy of the 18% of the bill that was suggested. Never really felt like he did more than drop off a water carafe and bring out our entrees. Nothing exemplary.

3.0,9/2/2016,"I have to be honest, the hype and the price just do not correlate.It is a short distance from me and would be a regular haunt if the quality and uniqueness justified the price For appetizers I had the Mackerel Tatami, yuzu, celery (around $17 or so) and the Romaine (has walnuts and tamarind $13 or so) since I'm a big fan of tamarind.The mackerel is raw of course and somewhat oily and the romaine is somewhat greasy (best had with your hands we were told :) Also had the butter noodle and spicy beef ($19 and $21). The chickpea hozon and black pepper on the butter noodle is delicious but there is a lot of butter so be prepared. The noodles are on the firm side.The spicy beef is good with firmish somewhat lightly boiled shells, and crispy fried shallots (see photos).We also had the Ocean trout (has a mussel broth and cherry tomatoes on which the very lightly seared tuna sits gently). Could not finish it because to be honest all the tastes together just did not work for me.I understand that the impossible burger is hot and famous and will try it next time but I have to be honest I do not see myself paying that much for a disconnected fusion no matter how great the presentation.

4.0,8/29/2016,"Came for The Impossible Burger: the plant-based burger that bleeds. Arrived at 12:15pm for lunch. They took our name down and told us it would be a 20 minute wait. When we received the text that our table was ready, we promptly hustled back to the restaurant where we ordered the $12 Impossible Burger, with cheese (+$1) and a side of fries. So the fries were too salty for me, it reminded me of McDonald's though.The Impossible Burger was incredible. The way it fills your mouth with every bite, when you look down at the bite you've taken, it feels and looks just like meat. It was crazy, every bite I took I had to remind myself that it wasn't actually meat! (I don't know if this matters but I am a meat eater and I came here doubting the taste of this ""burger""). I recommend ordering with the $1 American Cheese. I probably should have asked for a side of ketchup but the Momofuku Nishi's Ssam Sauce that is located on every table was a good (and spicy) replacement.I really do recommend everyone to come try the burger once. $13 for lunch is a pretty good price. Regarding Ambience: The one thing I don't like about Momofuku Nishi is that the seating bothers me to a point where I took away a star. I don't like sitting with strangers in the same table- maybe I'm old fashioned. This place is a little too casual and can get a little too loud.

I arrived at quarter of and was maybe the sixth (or so) party in line, and was seated within 5 minutes of opening time. For our group of 4, we also decided to split the pork buns, tuna buns, butter noodles, and chilled Shanghai noodle dishes. While the tuna bun and Shanghai noodle were good, the pork buns and butter noodles definitely stood out. The pork buns were perfectly crispy and fatty, and I certainly could have eaten more of them! The butter noodles really benefited from the chickpea flavor, which was pretty entrancing. As for the Impossible Burger, it was certainly very good -- moist and tasted like meat. I know a bit less about it, since my friends were the motivating factors in trying it. That being said, I had spent six years as a vegetarian and during that time had very little interest in trying to eat food items that were made to taste like meat. Since then, I've had absolutely delicious burgers elsewhere that are actually made of meat. So I feel like meat eaters will stick to meat burgers and vegetarians won't be too interested in this menu item... maybe it's designed to convert meat-eaters into vegetarians? I don't know!I thought the service was quite good here. The waiters were attentive and very nice. They did forget to bring out our last dish until we asked about it, but as soon as they realized their mistake they brought it out quite quickly and gave us both the panna cotta and pistachio bundt cake for free.

The food came out fast and the fries was amazing. The burger itself was pretty good. It looked like an actual meat hamburger and tasted pretty similar to one. It was kind of on the small side but in that small burger is 24g of protein (BF looked it up hehe)! It seems like most people came here to try the impossible burger. I think it is worth it to try because it's an experience and it's not so expensive and it's pretty good. The reason why I took off a star was because the service sucked.

If you want it for dinner, you have to go before they open at 5:30. They sell 40 burgers during happy hour 5:30-7, and generally the restaurant fills with 38 people when they open. Also, there is a patty melt off menu that you can order, which is basically a grilled cheese sandwich with Impossible meat. It's also really good, and has a lot more 'meat' if you are hungry, but it's $2 more. The balance of flavor is better w the burger so both my friend and I have decided on the burger in the future. We also ordered the tomato salad which was delicious. We even saved the sauce from the salad to dip out fries into. The squash side we would not order again. Just average.

It took about 20-30 minutes to ""fire"" up our pork shoulder, so we ordered some happy hour stuff (the karaage is really good). The Bo Ssam is massive, plenty for our group of 6 with a lot of meat leftover. Super tender and shreds beautifully, and lots of flavor infused in there. But best of all are all the sides and sauces. I love to play with my food. I can't remember all the sauces, but definitely don't be shy about asking for more (we weren't, those sauces go quickly). My favorite was the XO sauce. The basket of lettuces was crispy and fresh, there are red and white kimchis, and we had a large plate of thinly sliced marinated raw scallop. For some carb comfort, throw the rice, pork, and sauces into a bowl, mix, and eat. So good. This was definitely a very fun family meal, especially for those days when you don't want to bother deciding what the group should order.

Plus, when I called, all I got was an self-automated machine.I wasn't exactly happy about being seated on the outside when there was vacancy on the inside with the door opening and closing, but it was late and I was starved. The interior looks the same like the Noodle Bar. The bathroom is nice and spaceous.Upon receiving the menu, I ordered Jajangmyeon ($22) and the Roast Pork ($27). I was very disappointed when the food came. The proportions were sooo little. It was literally half a portion for one person! NO LIE! Instant Jajangmyeon + an egg on top would've been cheaper and more delicious than their Jajangmyeon.

You're experiencing the different textures from the crunching lettuce, the juicy tomato and the sponge-like bun. Half way in, your tastebuds realize it's not meat and it just becomes whatever.

Took a friend here for a farewell dinner, we ordered the romaine salad to start, the sweet potato with anchovies, and both entrees; the fish and the roasted pork. ROMAINE SALAD: This was delicious, but a bit messy to eat. Great option for vegans. Had an amazing Cesar-like taste, but without the anchovies. The tamarind gives it an interesting sweet and sour taste, and the nuts a nice crunch, as if bacon bits. This was probably the highlight of the meal. SWEET POTATO: bland, not enough seasoning, and anchovies had absolutely no flavor. Neither tasted fishy, nor salty. Consistency of the sweet potato felt a bit watery, and mushy. FISH ENTREE: skin was meant to be crispy, but it just fell flat to me as being more chewy, and could not even cut through it with my steak knife. Flavored again felt bland. ROASTED PORK: This was fine, mediocre at best. Two large, thin cut slabs of pork with an au ju sauce. Cooked well, I'll give them that, but I literally felt like it was Thanksgiving dinner with Canadian Ham. Nothing really special. Didn't think photos were warranted with the way I felt about the food. Service was excellent, the wait wasn't very long-arrived at 7:30 and got seated right away.

For two we ordered the raw beef, pepper shrimp, butter noodle and jajangmyeon. The best dishes were definitely the jajangmyeon with the fried egg on top and the raw beef. I don't usually eat raw beef, but this dish was marinated with dashi ponzu which gave it a nice citrus flavour, masking any raw taste I was reluctant about. The pepper shrimp was recommended by the server, but we found it slightly awkward to eat since the shrimp was supposedly young enough to eat whole with the head and shell, but too crunchy with the antennas sticking all over the place! The table next to us decided to de-shell their shrimp and seemed to have a pretty difficult time considering there wasn't much meat to begin with. For dessert we had the mixed berry rhubarb panna cotta. Not much to talk about here.There used to be a no tipping policy here with the tips built into the prices, but this has been removed making this place more expensive",5,1,2,Esther S.,"Manhattan, NY",291,155,410
4.0,7/16/2016,"Delicious food! Hip and trendy atmosphere, convenient location, and the friendly staff was helpful and available yet not pushy and intrusive. Thoroughly enjoyed the blood orange daiquiri--very refreshing on a hot Summer's night.    Of course, we had to try the caccio e pepe (butter noodles) since it is supposed to be their signature dish, and it was good.  However, the chili squid was my favorite.  We also had the mackerel tataki and red snapper appetizers, and both were fresh, tasty, and well presented.  Both entrées were delicious, and I particularly enjoyed the crispy skin on the savory ocean trout.  The roast pork with asparagus was a decadent combination.  Of course, as a group of six we had to have a taste of dessert!  The strawberry rhubarb Panama cotta was fruity and light--amazing!!  I could have done with less noise as we couldn't hear those at the end of our table when we were trying to have conversation, but overall this was an excellent experience, and I look forward to my next foray at this or other Momofuku Nishi locations.  Well done!",0,0,0,Martha L.,"Harrison, NY",1,5,0
2.0,7/2/2016,"This is the first time where the Yelp reviews were totally misleading. I went in with lofty expectations, thinking the food would be out of this world, and that I would forever be in love with every dish from this restaurant. Instead, it was a complete and utter disappointment. We ordered the soft tofu, fried whole shrimp, clams Lisboa, chili squid, ocean trout, and fried potato. The flavors had potential but there was nothing innovative or mind blowing about it. When we asked the waiter about portion size to gauge how much to order, he said it's usually 2 1/2 dishes per diner!!!  We should have known then to gtfo. The portions practically required the use of a magnifying glass to see and should have been considered part of a kids menu or truly just as tapas. We left with stomachs still growling, hungry for more food and just more from the experience.

I was looking forward to going with friends because the Yelp reviews made it sound great, but...It was loud. I don't mean it was a little difficult to hear every word of conversation at the table.  It was very hard to hear anything except for roaring noise. The dishes were the size of small appetizers. Think of a tapas menu, except the dishes are called an entree. The flavors were so so, nothing even approaching great.  The potato side dish was by far the best thing we had. The clams, squid and fish were ok. I don't mind spending a little more for food, if the price is commensurate with the quality.

4.0,6/28/2016,"*Review for Brunch only!Momofuku Nishi just recently started serving brunch, so when my friend told me she was visiting NYC, I thought we would give this place a try (I seriously still need to come for dinner though!!!). The interior looks just like all of David Chang's other restaurants, really simple and clean with wooden high chairs and tables.  Brunch service starts at 12pm but we arrived at around 11:40am just to be safe. When my friend arrived, she was second in line. There were plenty of free tables during our meal, but I think this will pick up once more people know about their brunch service. While waiting for them to set up, we also spotted David Chang in the kitchen...score! After greeting all the guests (he's a super nice guy!!!), he actually dined right next to us with another party, pretty cool :).here's what we got to share amongst the 4 of us:Diver Scallops (tiger's milk, shio kombu) $17YUMMMMM what a good start. The diver scallops were perfectly fresh, and the tiger's milk was a nice acidic balance to the creaminess of the scallops. The dish also comes out super pretty in a vibrant green.Soft Tofu (soy milk, bonji) $9Homemade tofu, which was good (nothing terribly special), but pretty small portion for $9. Mixed Greens (kimchi vinaigrette) $10Fresh and perfect for a summer day. The kimchi vinaigrette provided a nice amount of heat and acidity.Dagwood Sandwich (the ""mile high sandwich"") $22This was delicious!!! This was a humongous tall sandwich with layers of pork pâté, cured mackerel, roasted chicken. Super flavorful with multiple textures...loved it! It comes with two halves, which we then halved again to share - it was plenty! Order this!!! Even though it's a hefty price to pay for a sandwich, I feel like all the ingredients in there are all top quality.Ocean Trout & Unagi Sauce Rice Bowl (soy egg, kimchi, hon shimeji, green onion) $24This was pretty good, pretty much a fancy bibimbap. The ocean trout was reaaaallyyy well done, it was at a perfect medium rare with the vibrant coral color still visible. It also had this super nice crispy skin on top.Butter Noodle (chickpea hozon, black pepper, fried egg) $19This seems to have been renamed from the original ceci e pepe name - it IS super rich like everyone describes it, but I think this actually had too much butter, and perhaps along with the sweetness from the hozon, it tasted exactly like shortbread cookies..kinda weird on pasta, but I guess interesting? Pretty damn pricey for the portion though.We got to try their papaya salad too, compliments of the chef. I loved the slight hints of cilantro throughout. Since it was a hot summer day, I also ordered their limoncello slushie which was delicious...super small glass, but refreshing!Time to stop by for dinner sometime to try their dinner-only dishes!***Brunch is walk-in's only right now, no reservations!",1,1,2,Patricia C.,"Manhattan, NY",135,275,1463

Onto the food.... we knew we were going to get dessert afterwards so we ordered lightly. For the 3 of us, we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 pastas. The red snapper and diver scallops were both light and refreshing. Had a nice citrus profile which was a good palette starter. As for the pastas, the waitress recommended the ceci e Pepe and we added on the Soft shell crab. Both were decent but not spectacular.

5.0,5/23/2016,All of Momofuku's restaurants serve delicious umami flavor food. Momofuku Nishi from start to finish was phenomenal! We started off with their version of an Asian inspired Cesar salad. Wow this was the best salad I've ever had. The shaved and sliced walnuts cooked in fish sauce and butter coated each lettuce leaf perfectly. We then got the clams lisboa which was so flavorful and the chow mein noodles were so good I just couldn't have enough! My husband got their famous cheeseless caci e Pepe which was excellently creamy and flavorful. We indulged and got a side of flash fried potatoes with smoked egg yolk. It blew my mind away!

4.0,5/15/2016,"I'll definitely be back! This is a great place to go with a group of 4 or 6- that way you can taste multiple dishes. And yes, it is loud, and you will be seated in close proximity to others (especially as there are predominately communal tables), but it isn't any louder than ssam bar. The space itself is well lit and intimate, although the decor is a little spartan. And, they're working to improve the space, including putting a wall between the noisy (and hot) kitchen and the back bar, as well as installing more noise cancelling tiles on the ceilings.As for the food, for two people, 1 app, 2 pastas and maybe 1 side should be more than enough. And if you're torn between and entree and a myun dish, go for the latter. Definitely what the restaurant does best.We split the beef crudo, scallops, clam pasta, lamb pasta and cece e pepe between two people. It was way too much food. The strongest dish was the clam pasta. Although a bit salty, the clay pot-esque crust on the noodles, with the charred cabbage and heady oil was delicious. The scallops were also phenomenal: light, refreshing, with beautiful flavors of lime and yuzu/shiso. Cece e pepe is definitely something you should try once to see if you like. It's slightly sweet, buttery and peppery. The lamb pasta, while a huge portion and absolutely delicious, was no different from a standard lamb ragu you'd get at your great neighborhood Italian place. The beef crudo was also very light, although I didn't like the texture of the pickled watermelon.The service was absolutely wonderful and cheerful, but sometimes the servers were a bit hard to hear. However, our dishes were always cleared, waters refilled, napkins refolded and drinks replenished. The waiter forgot to bring our beef crudo and when we asked for it to be taken off our bill at the end of our meal, she brought it out anyway and comped us for it. And while people may say it's overpriced, I disagree. There's no tipping, and if you stay within the pastas and appetizers it'll only be about $40-50pp.",0,0,0,Ange S.,"Summit, NJ",1,29,1
5.0,5/15/2016,"David Chang, you did not let me down. I think Momofuku Nishi is my favorite of his restaurants (second to Ko)! The restaurant has that momofuku clean, oaky look and feel. The menu is fairly simple though ever-changing with what's in season. There's 4 main components: 1) appetizers, 2) myūn, which are the noodles and pasta dishes, 3) entree, usually only a couple large meat/fish options, and 4) side dishes. Of all the times I've dined at Nishi, I've never ordered an entree dish, but rather order a hefty mix of the other items on the menu. Between 2 people, I think it's comfortable to order a couple appetizers, a couple myūn dishes, and a side dish. I always order the beautifully crafted cocktails--but should really focus on saving room for dessert!  The flavors are innovative and refreshing. I would call it an Asian-Italian fusion at the bottom of it all. Thanks to the frequently updated menu and the ease of making reservations using the online system--I've dined here quite a number of times already! If you see any of the following items on the menu, I highly recommend ordering it! Of the appetizers, the Diver Scallops are served with ceviche-like flavors, and the scallops themselves melt in your mouth. I also really loved the silky Tofu with smoked trout roe and peas, a delicate balance of delicious. Of the myūn dishes, the Ceci e Pepe is a staple served with a dressing of chickpea that's fermented like miso and fresh black pepper. My favorite may be the Clams Grand Lisboa, which is Lisbon style clams on al dente chow mien--very, very flavorful! I also enjoy the Chitarra with the fresh take on xo sauce, Spicy Lamb Lumache, and I was lucky enough to come during ramp season and had the ramp gnocchi. Of the side dishes, the fried fingerling potatoes with smoked yolk is very good, but if you see the grilled sweet potato & anchovy--it's one of the flavors I've memorized and learned to recreate it at home because it's so good.  On top of everything amazing that goes with dining at Momofuku Nishi--they also don't accept gratuity because they're already paying the staff appropriately!",1,0,1,Kathy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",237,282,810

Then we moved on to the pastas, had to try the Ceci e Pepi since it seemed to be very popular and it was what I expected, the chickpea sauce was great. It gives you the feeling of cheese without the heft and the pepper sets it off just right. We also had the Chitarra which was almost opposite of the Ceci e Pepi, it was very spicy and tangy with a strong bite. Both were spicy in different ways.

The Ceci y Pepe portion was really small. One person could never get full on that one dish alone whereas each of the other pasta dishes we got would have been plenty for one person. We ended up getting two orders of the fingerling potatoes. They were crazy delicious. The crispy sweet potato was unappealing.

5.0,4/20/2016,"What a meal! I stumbled upon a last minute reservation for Momofuku Nishi on a Saturday at 8pm and immediately took it. I had read about this latest Momofuku and was excited to be able to try it without having to endure a long wait. We arrived right on time and were shown to the middle of one of the communal tables. All seating here is communal, unless you are a four top, in which case you can have your own high-top for four. We started with a glass of the Australian chardonnay. It was refreshing and delightful. We ordered the fried whole shrimp, the scallop crudo, and the beef crudo. The flavors exploded in every dish. The fried whole shimp were my least favorite, as I am not a fan of eating the shell of crustacean. The crudo of scallop was refreshing and light and the beef was delicate and tender. For mains we decided to stick to pastas. We ordered the ceci e pepe, the clams grand lisboa and the chicken and dumplings. Each one of these dishes was fantastic, but my favorite was the clams. I've been thinking about this clam dish for four days, it was so special. The noodles were chow main and they had cabbage and a slightly sweet flavor. The Ceci e pepe was also awesome. There is no cheese in the dish and they use fermented chickpeas to get the rich flavor. We devoured it. The chicken and dumplings were also good but not as special as the other two.

We literally saw people with ear plugs in their ears.And then there's the service... the ""no tipping"" thing is probably a mistake. The service here needs to be better. When someone asks if they have diet coke the waitress shouldn't reply ""nope""... Also, they really should consider stocking their full bar instead of just saying they have a full bar.

3.0,4/6/2016,"Because of the Momofuko rep and the hype this place has gotten, we made an effort to come out here for date night with a resi. The menu is simple, dishes are unique, and overall the experience is good.Hypes:- Great intimate atmosphere. Casual, cafeteria like classy feel. - Spanish Mackerel Tataki - Celery you can't tell is celery. Really good! and seriously come on, anything seafood with yuzu is a hit- Diver Scallop - This dish took me back to Peru. If you have had tiger's milk ( a mix if spices, onions, lemon, etc), you will definitely want this. Thinly sliced scallops with crisp onions and shio kombu.  This was my favorite.- Beef Crudo - another dish hot with the crowd. Thinly sliced beef, dashi ponzu, the watermelon pickles all flows well together. Delicious- The chicken and dumplings is a hearty dish, a bit on the salty side but with a unique asian twist.  Gripes:- If you're coming here for a bang for your buck, this is not your place to be. - The appetizers and sides are better than the actual dishes. Would have ordered more of those (Romaine and walnut cauda, shrimp)- ceci e pepe - EVERYONE gets this dish, and its overhyped beyond belief. I'd give it a 3/5 and not order it again though. The other dishes are better. Its on the sweeter side and the black pepper overpowers the flavor",3,2,2,Shaila S.,"Manhattan, NY",397,330,267
3.0,4/6/2016,Good place to sit for a few hours and catch up with a friend or two. Make a reservation though. Beef crudo - highly recommend! Diver scallops were great. Ocean trout was the saltiest dish with the most flavor out of tonight. I enjoyed it Cece di pepe was a good buttery + peppery dish. Maybe a bit too peppery for my tastes. Pistachio bundt cake was great. Get that over the Panna cotta. Don't come here if you're looking for a hearty meal at a quick buck. Def a higher end.

1.0,4/2/2016,"Let me start saying the wait to get your table in this place without a reservation is ridiculous. 1.5 hours for 2. We ordered a few dishes but one of them was the chicken and dumplings. There was no dumplings, as in the Chinese style dumplings with chicken wrapped inside. Their definition of dumplings was shredded chicken with dumpling skin, like pasta. And it was $30. Definitely not worth it!!! I could have gotten the same one in a quart size container in Chinatown for $3.50!! And instead of their thick dumpling skins, the ones in Chinatown is served in rice balls. But everything else is the same. We paid $100 for the meal, but it wasn't worthy it at all.

4.0,4/1/2016,"Love David Chang's Italian/Korean debut. Fantastic presentation (5+/5); neat wooden decorated store (4.5/5); Some dishes are outstanding while others are more subjective (3.75/5). The appetizers and noodle dishes are highlights (4.5/5).Dinner is reservationable: My friend and I made the reservation for Friday night within the same week through momofuku website (Nishi also takes voice message reservation). We ordered one appetizer: Diver scallop; two myun: Clams Grand Lisboa and Spicy Lamb Sichuan; for main dish: Smoked Trout. The diver scallop and Spicy Lamb Sichuan are my favorite. diver scallop - creative way to eat raw fish and amazing presentation. Scallop meat is very fresh and soft; the light green colored sauce looks amazing and it's taste balanced the fishy component in scallop really well. Spicy Lamb Sichuan: great marriage of authentic taste of Chinese spicy lamb dish with fried garlic flakes and Italian jumbo shells. This hearty dish reminds me of mom's spicy beef tomato sauced bow ties farfalle (Yum Yum!) The other two dishes are good but hard to fully comprehend for me.Overall, interesting fun food to try out.

3.0,3/30/2016,"David Chang is coming back down to earth. My last few visits to his restaurants have had less of a wow factor for me. I have been visiting the Momofuku restaurants since the original opened, and I consider Ssam Bar one of the best spots in NYC. My buddy and I went to Nishi. The restaurant design is typical of all the David Chang restaurants: clean and simple with lots of light colored wood. I find the momofuku brand consistency reassuring. The wait on a Tuesday at 8:30 was 45 minutes, so we waited at a bar next door and they texted me when seats opened up. We ordered:Diver scallop: beautiful and fresh. The sauce of Tiger's milk and shio kombu was very goodShaved Winter Vegetables: This dish is a bit ridiculous. The plating is pretty, but a handful of curled shavings made for a very stingy portion. It is the least expensive dish on the appetizer list, but $15 is still too much. Romaine: This version of a ceasar salad was good, but I expected betterCeci e pepe: The creamy texture was nice, and the pasta was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was sweet, almost like butterscotch. I am not a fan of this dish. I know that it has gotten a lot of attention as the dish to get on this menuSpicy Beef Sichuan: This is THE dish to get.

The dinner was ok and the BBQ Mackarel and the sweet potato saved the day, but I would have probably given Nishi 3 stars at that point. As I was eating my low carb anti-meat meal, I enviously watched my neighbors without ordering restrictions being served a whole different class of meal... Sooooooo, I went back this past friday night and ordered without restriction: Beef Crudo and the Tofu appetizers, Spicy Beef sichuan and squid pastas, and the pork dinner. Every single thing was great. There was not one dish that didn't hit. My favorite was the squid and the pork... which are musts if you go here.

3.0,3/24/2016,"Visited last night and was seated after an hour wait.  Certainly has the Momofuku feel that we all know and (like?).  I have eaten at the Noodle Bar, Ko (1.0), Ssam, drank at Booker & Dax, and had the Fuku sandwich, so I would say that I am at least a fan of David Cheng.  That said, I thought this spot was only alright.  I like the Clam dish, and though the noodles that accompanied it were very good, but the beef sichuan flat noodle was too salted and was strangely not all that flavorful.  It was an interesting kind of pappardelle with chinese flavors that didn't add up.  The scallops appetizers also lacked a depth of flavor--my wife and I almost didn't finish it. All that said, I recommend giving this place a shot.  The service was very strong and friendly, and the price is ok, considering tips are included.  I might give it another go, but I wouldn't make a big thing of it.",1,0,0,Ian A.,"Brooklyn, NY",354,215,0
1.0,3/20/2016,"This place is Pathetic with a capital 'P'! I came here on Sat between 8-9pm with a friend who wanted to check out the place, we got a table right away. Due to design, we had to share the table with 4 other people, like almost everyone else. We were cramped for space holding our winter jackets on our laps and shopping bags stuffed around our seats on the floor. The seating arrangement would probably fit more a college food court than a rest overcharging for food! Yes, the 'no tipping' portion of the money is nicely added in each and every single meal you'll order. Sounds good at first and many people fall for it but it's simply a hidden scam. The menu, just like the 'decor' of the place, are minimalistic. My friend ordered their 'pasta' dish, the cheapest on the menu along with some bitter greens and I had the mackerel fish and a cocktail, bloody orange something. The size of the portions is a joke for the price, a JOKE. The size of my fish without any doubt was under 0.5 oz, or 20g. But the hugest mistake in my dish was the way this tiny piece was served, placed onto some very bland cubes of parsnip-like veggie soaking up this vinegary lightly salty watery broth! Come on, Mr. Chef, but letting a piece of fish soak up the liquid makes it SOGGY and pure YUK! Would placing a fish on some sort of rice/grain kill you? Or maybe placing this watery concoction (was is the point of it any way someone explain it please!) in a small container would spare the main edible portion of my meal? After all, you do charge for it over $30!!! WTF!?! So I had to eat my fish, whose BTW subtle taste was completely overpowered by a nasty bbq sauce, under 5 mins to save it from becoming a sad, soggy, shoe-sole like object. I did share a bite from my friend's 'pasta' dish...scam #2 all the way. Whatever it was, it was underdone, no, not 'al dente', UNDERDONE, yet sticky! That's truly amazing talent of the chef, to under-cook 'pasta' yet make it sticky! Any Italian would be appalled and probably leave running away scared for life!!! And the amount of this 'hard-sticky goo' was a handful. I'm not even going to comment on poor greens, they are not at fault, they are just greens that happen to be victims to a very bitter, salty and sticky sauce. Again, for the price, I could feed a small village with these greens. Cliche. Last but not least, my cocktail. It was tasty! Yes it was! And that's why I assign this place ONE star. But I wonder, wasn't there either another glass that this drink could be served in or couldn't you simply pour more? (oh you couldn't since how much MORE would you have to charge it, geee) Since Starbucks recently came under attacks that they under fill lattes cups by 10%, imagine if the same people who are suing Starbucks saw my glass 90% EMPTY?

4.0,3/20/2016,"Some dishes were better than others, but in general, interesting and tasty Asian/Italian food.I made a reservation for 4 for 6:30 PM on a weekend, and the place was fairly busy throughout the duration of the meal. We split the tofu and the beef crudo to start, and they were both pretty fresh, particular the tofu. For entrees, we order the ceci e pepe, the spicy beef sichuan, the chitarra, and the roast beef. The pasta dishes in general I found to be far better, particularly the ceci e pepe and the spicy beef noodles. The ceci e pepe was particularly unique and tasty, while the flat noodle dish had a nice kick and was a bit more traditional. The roast beef wasn't very unique and prepared pretty normally.I'd definitely come back to eat again given the meal quality, but I would focus more on the noodle dishes.",1,1,1,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,792,33
3.0,3/18/2016,"Ate at Momofuku's Nishi twice and I'm writing this the day after the second time.  The first time we ate there my wife and friends loved it.  Everything was tasty and delicious.  We loved the Fried whole shrimp, the Beef Sichuan Flat Noodles, the Chittara, Chicken Dumplings, beef Caarpaccio, Black Sea bass crudo, the Romaine lettuce dish they had, and whatever else we ordered for dinner cause it seems we almost ordered one of everything.  Also for dessert the pistachio buddy cake was delish. Our second time around was the polar opposite.  My wife and I ordered our favorites from the first visit and we were pretty disappointed this time around. The Fried whole shrimp tasted off.  Just didn't taste like it did the first time like they tweeted the spices added to it or something.  Just wasn't a fan this second time having it. The Romaine & Walnut Bagna Cauda was spot on delish!Clams Grand Lisboa - chow mein, oregano, cabbage - This was our favorite dish of the nightSpicy Beef Sichuan - seemed under seasoned.  Was good but some salt could've made it greatRoast Pork - white kimchi - This we tried for the first time and I couldn't eat it.  Imagine taking a pork loin, brine it in saltwater overnight, and then roasting it unseasoned, aside from the salt water brine.  That's what this was like.  I took one bite and then a second to make sure my sour face was accurate from the first bite.  You have to love the taste of plain pork to eat this dish.  The white Kim chi was nice tho!Pistachio bundt cake was delishPanna Cotta with plum vinegar - out first time trying it.  It was interesting in a good way but next time I'd double up on the bundt cake.  The flavor profile reminded me of yogurt but in Panna Cotta form. I know I bashed on the pork and it's just my opinion.  To Momofuku Nishi's defense they did notice my disgust for the dish and happily took it off the bill given that my wife and I could get past the second bite of it so bravo and kudos to the staff for noticing.

It is exactly what the name brings to mindWe went with one appetizer, two pastas, one main and a last minute side addition. Skipped the desserts because they didn't seem too interesting (and we had Lady M before dinner).Scallops in tiger's milk and shio kombu was delicious and refreshing start to the meal.We had the Ceci e Pepe as well as the Spicy Beef Sichuan. Ceci e Pepe was my favorite and you wouldn't know there wasn't any actual cheese. For the Spicy Beef Sichuan, the notes made me think it was going to be Korean Rice Cakes (silly of me), and it was a really cool take of pappardelle x mabo tofu sauce. I would have given Nishi 5 stars had we stopped here, but the main left a bit to be desired. We ordered the Pork which while very juicy was not all that flavorful for me. The white kimchi was good to pair, but I think this one overall fell flat for us honestly. However, I will give them credit that the fried fingerling potatoes and smoked yolk with tarragon was crack. I could not stop eating them! Overall, really great experience in my opinion. I like that restaurants are building tips into the prices (gotta pay the back-of-house!).

2.0,3/12/2016,"Why is this place even a thing?  Great Italian food is extraordinary as is great Asian food.  This concept seems to have been created just because, and in our opinions (4 of us), there is absolutely no reason for it.  Although there were a few things that were tasty, most of it seemed unnecessary, including the very highly touted cece di pepe.  It doesn't hold a candle to the real Italian dish, cacio di pepe.  Not even close.  Nor did any of the other dishes we tried.  Chicken and Dumplings was bland, boring, the chicken overcooked, the dish a waste of calories. The broad pasta dish was overdone with chili paste and was pathetically out of balance.  The carpaccio was underseasoned and lacked the flavor balance of the Italian dish. The fingerlings tasted as though they'd been sitting for a week. This restaurant is trying to be creative and inventive, but again, there is NO reason for this to even exist.  Trying to be inventive in the food world is great, but change just for the sake of change is not.The ""signature"" pistacchio cake-really?  If I bought it in a 7-11 wrapped in cello, I'd think it was dry and awful.Plus those horribly uncomfortable stools should be outlawed.  Book an appointment with your chiropractor immediately after dinner.",1,1,0,Selma S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",2,21,1

5.0,3/9/2016,"I took a bit of time to reflect on the monster meal I had here with my friends several weeks ago. I wasn't sure what I was expecting going into this dining experience, and I wanted to let my thoughts percolate a bit afterwards. Let me explain... my first Momofuku experience was at Momofuku Ssam when it first opened, nearly a decade ago, when I was a youngster with a novice palette and an even more novice budget for food. I remember walking away from that experience thinking David Chang was overrated and I didn't get why something that should be so simple could be so (relatively) expensive. You could definitely argue that I had a complete under-appreciation for technique, innovation, and even flavor a decade ago.The problem with youth is that you're impressionable and stubborn and once you get something in your head, you never think of changing your mind. I had since avoided anything related to David Chang (sorry David, but I realize now that it was my loss), but with the convincing of my friends, I walked into Nishi determined to keep an open mind. I'm glad I did.Simply put... the food is good. Really good. The smaller plates were all delicious, but the highlights of the night for me were the pastas. The ceci e pepe was extremely hyped by my friend, and I'd say it didn't disappoint. I mean, we ordered seconds and I'm pretty sure he still dreams about it. My favorite dish, I think, was the Chitarra, a dish of squid, xo sauce, with fresh and fermented chili. It was like an umami bomb... each chewing motion made me salivate into my mouth and I just couldn't get enough of it.Anyway, there's a lot of detailed reviews here already on the various dishes, so I'd recommend reading those through.

The chicken and dumplings was more like a chicken noodle soup and our waiter didn't seem too sold on it but we ordered it anyway and werevery happy about our choice. The dessert options were a little weak but we went with the pistachio cake. It was good but not as exciting as the rest of the meal. The only reason I took a star off is because of the seating.

4.0,3/4/2016,"KenScale: 8.5/10David Chang is probably one of the most high-profile chefs in America, or in the world. His growing Momofuku empire is making waves everywhere these days, not just in New York, and he is a regular contributor to GQ magazine's food section. Obviously, there was a massive hype for the new establishment from the Momofuku group in Chelsea, this time supposedly a fusion of Korean and Italian. Fusion of two or more different cuisines is always a high-risk, high-reward proposition, and given how I had mixed experiences everywhere in other Momofuku establishments, I knew that I would either love or hate this restaurant, which is still one of the hottest tickets to get since its opening in January. I'm pleased to report that Nishi was one of the better experiences I've had at a Momofuku restaurant.The concise menu at Nishi does seem like a mash of Korean and Italian, but it's probably too simplistic to define it that way. David Chang always had a knack for creating his own culinary identity (no matter how successful that was). Born and raised in Korea, I would never call his food Korean although no one probably played a more influential role in promoting the brand of Korean food than he did. His culinary inventiveness never quite appealed to my palate in many of the Momofuku places, but this time I can tell that he put a lot of thoughts into his menu, with a lot of great dishes. Who would have thought that simple romaine and walnut salad with bagna cauda would have such wonderful freshness to it and spot-on dressing? Tofu with smoked trout roe and rye bonji was also a nice dish that you could try for appetizer. The highlight of Nishi's menu really lies in the ""myun"" (""noodle"" in Korean) section. These dishes look closer to pastas than Korean noodle dishes, but there were full of surprises. I absolutely loved the spicy kick of chitarra with squid, XO sauce and chili. The famed ceci e pepe, another inventive take on one of the most classic pastas, also was delightful, replacing cheese with chickpea hozon. I don't know what trick the kitchen played, but the dish definitely surpassed other similar dishes in Italian restaurants I've been too. Spicy beef Sichuan, which looks like ragu-based pappardelle, was also brilliant, ingeniously introducing the spicy Sichuan feel to the dish without overpowering in flavor. Clams came with chow mein-style thin noodles; the flavor of the dish was somewhat funkier than I had imagined, but I can see that there was a lot of thought put into this combining influences from Macao and Italy quite seamlessly. I was also a huge fan of the grilled sweet potato and anchovy side dish, a mix of sweet and salty flavor that worked quite well together. The dessert menu at Nishi is somewhat concise compared to the savory dishes. Panna cotta and plum vinegar had that citrusy flavor to the silky smooth panna cotta, but I found the other dish, pistachio bundt cake, to be more delightful, a simple dish that had refined sweetness to it in surprising fashion.Getting a reservation at Nishi would take some efforts; best bet is probably to go as soon as it opens and hope there are walk-in tables or counter seats available. I went into Momofuku's website (the restaurant opens its reservation spaces 15 days in advance, at 10 a.m. every day) and wound up getting only early dinner tables at 6 p.m. despite logging in as soon as 10 a.m. hit. To my surprise, though, the restaurant wasn't as full as I had imagined on a Thursday night, and I didn't see any lines forming around the blocks (perhaps the hype had already quieted down already or maybe things are supposed to be crazy on weekends?). Nishi has a full bar, with some surprisingly good wine selections that would go well with the dishes. The décor still retains that hip atmosphere you see in other Momofuku establishments like Ssam Bar. I'm really glad that Nishi put together some really memorable dishes despite my reservations on David Chang-style food. I would definitely come back for more at some point this year.",4,0,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

While the crispy shrimp and cacio were phenomenal, the chicken dumplings were incredibly underseasoned, which was a shame because the broth was incredibly rich and deep in flavor. Even worse, the piece de resistance--the lamb--was just sad. The dish comprised of a few measly slices swimming in a lukewarm broth with white beans and absolutely NO SEASONING. Not sure if they were just off that night, but for $150 for dinner, this was a pretty pathetic attempt at continuing the Momofuku brand.

I just don't know that I'm in a hurry to recall or recommend any in particular (except the ceci e pepe, see below).  Lots of carefully crafted, but small, plates add up - I would say we ended up spending more than we expected, even allowing for the service-inclusive pricing (which I am actually a fan of).

4.0,2/28/2016,"I was incredibly excited to get a rare 5:30 pm dinner reservation here. I wish I could say that my disappointment of nishi was due to the heightened anticipation, but the food was a bit of a let down. Fresh fun food, but for its price uncreative and/or different. To start, there was a hostess who literally held on to the door and wouldn't let me into the restaurant until the outer door had closed first. I felt like I was in a childish game of not being let in. Either have a sign on the door, give me a signal or some kind of eye contact, or don't have tables right in front of the door. We ordered three apps - the shrimp, the black bass, and the fried shrimp.  They were all fresh and cooked perfectly, but I literally had the same thing the night before at Moyama a couple blocks down...for half the cost. For entrees we had the ceci y pepe, the chicken and dumplings, and the clams with chow mein noodles.  We also ordered a side of the fried potatoes.  The pasta was my least favorite -- it tasted more like a perfectly cooked butter flavored pasta. I liked the clams with noodles, though for its price it wasn't anything spectacular.  The chicken and dumplings and side of fried potatoes however were a 5+ star rating for me.  It had layers of flavor that shouldn't be overlooked. Order this dish!!I was taken aback on the limited bottles of wine under $70. Unfortunately they ran out of the $60 some odd priced sauv blanc so I was up sold to paying for a $70 some odd bottle. Overall it's more exciting finally nabbing a reservation than the food itself....",1,1,0,Jenny K. L.,"Oradell, NJ",185,529,492

4.0,2/24/2016,"Very interesting Asian/Korean-inspired approach to Italian. Absolutely worth a try, but unlike David Chang's other places, probably not quite worth the 2 hour wait.

I love love momofuku ko, felt so excited to try this new restaurant, but it was disappointing. I may just don't get the flavor of the food, although it can be spicy, sweet, or whatever sounds complex, the flavor just doesn't reach any depth, or the flavor is bold but not in a good delicious way. For example, spicy beef Sichuan noodle, I only tasted this hot crushed red pepper, and sweetness, some how you can also taste the bitterness from red pepper, that was all.",0,1,0,zi x.,"Manhattan, NY",3,189,0

5.0,2/22/2016,"When I arrived at Momofuku Nishi the restaurant was alive and buzzing. There was definitely an excitement in the air, of people who all knew that they had secured a coveted 7:30pm Friday night reservation and the energy could not be contained.Nishi is not a big restaurant, but the layout is a very long rectangle, so from the moment you walk in, you can see the front of the restaurant, the area where they make drinks/desserts behind that, and further behind that the kitchen area where all the cooks are moving about trying to make sure that your cece e pepe comes out hot and ready to eat. It's fascinating to be able to see all of these different spaces at once.If you dine here, I recommend coming with 4 and seeing if you can get a high top on the right side of the restaurant. Similar to booth seating, you don't have to share a table with anyone, and there is enough space for privacy. They even considerately put hooks underneath the tables so that we could hang our bags. It's nice to have and listen only to the conversation with the people you actually came with.I came to Nishi with friends that really, truly love food. No hype, no pretensions, the best kind of people to eat with. ""Just give us everything on the apps menu except the two veggies dishes, all the pasta dishes, the BBQ Pork entree, and smashed potatoes,"" we told the waitress. We wanted to get a real feel for the restaurant, and how can you do that if you don't order a lot? I think she might have had her doubts, but when we ordered that second round of cece e pepe, I think she knew then that we were serious about our food.Honestly, I enjoyed almost every dish here. It was gluttony at its best, and I make no apologies nor do I have any regrets. I left gut bustingly full, and I would do it again. I love that David Chang took some of my favorite dishes, put his own spin on them ( chickpea hozon and rye bonji - seasonings created by him ) and made them new and unique again.If I have to narrow it down to my top 5 - I'd say go for the Tofu with Roe and Rye Bonji, this is one of those dishes that I think is so simple, but when Tofu is balanced with roe and salty sweet soy and tamari flavor it just keeps you wanting more. Obviously, you have to get the cece e pepe. I think you would be surprised how well his chickpea hozon easily replaces parmesan and that fresh cracked pepper just brings it all together. My third favorite dish was the Clams Grand Lisboa, I did not expect to like this dish, but the texture of the noodles - both crispy in some bites and chewy in others, combined with the refreshing cabbage and what I think is xo sauce, made a salty, sweet, and complicated combination that I absolutely loved. My fourth favorite dish, the fried fingerling potatoes with smoked yolk and tarragon. If you have ever had smashed potatoes before that were done right, you know how good this dish is on its own. But, pair that with the creaminess of a little smoked yolk... OMG. This takes it to another level. It's so delicious, you or rather I, literally, wish I had had more space to eat more of this at the end of my meal. My fifth favorite, would be the pistachio bundt cake. It was dense, moist, buttery, and tasted like pistachio's! I did not care for the cream that came on the side though, I think I expected it to be creamy and sweet, so when that saltiness hit the back of my tongue, I was taken a bit off guard. I tried a couple times, but still couldn't get the two to work together. Oh well, you win a lot and then you lose some.I would definitely return to Nishi. I loved the service, the food, the art work on the walls, the upscale yet comfortable space, and the fact that they take reservations, albeit hard to get. Definitely lives up to the hype and then some.",10,4,3,Vicky L.,"Jersey City, NJ",813,975,510
5.0,2/21/2016,"I came here on a Friday night and it was a two hour wait. Simply walk in and the hostess will take down your name and number so she can text you to notify when your table is ready. The website recently is taking reservations so that makes it much more convenient! No lie when the hostess told us that it will be a two hour wait, so we decided to go to a nearby restaurant for a drink. Even though it is a two hour wait, trust me, it is definitely worth it. This is also my first Momofuku experience, so I had very high expectations of this restaurant and David Chang's innovative taste and touches to his dishes. We were seated in the back by the bar with coat/bag hooks (yay!). We got the chance to see the bartenders make drinks and get some ideas on how to make the blood orange daiquiri. *Menu does change, so don't expect the same items listed below to be on the menu everyday. Appetizers:Let me start with my favorite dish of the entire meal...Romaine & Walnut Bagna Cauda- A refreshing twist of freshly crisp stacked romaine lettuce tossed in a walnut dressing. This is SOOO AMAZING! There are shavings on top of the lettuce that looks like cheese, but there is no cheese indeed! The flavors of the walnut and texture of the crunchy lettuce really complimented well with one another. This was so amazing that we had to order another. Mind you, this was just an appetizer and we ordered much more after this. This appetizer is a must order! Especially if you love greens as much as I do! Sirloin Crudo- This is thin sliced beef served with Momofuku pickles. The beef was very thinly sliced which paired well with the tint of watermelon pickles. This appetizer was very fresh and was a nice start to the rest of the meal coming for us. Also a must try when coming here for the first time. Raw Diver Scallop- This appetizer certainly gives a surprising twist to eating scallops. The scallops are thinly sliced and drizzled with tiger's milk and shio kombu. I wish I could explain what the last two ingredients are, but I have no clue. Once placed into your mouth, it has a soft and delicate taste. Something different from how I normally eat my scallops, but also worth a try. I needed to add a little bit of salt, but otherwise this appetizer is one of a kind. If you like seafood and scallops, go for it, but I would try the other appetizers instead. Entrees:Chitarra- This was recommended to us because we couldn't choose between the Ceci e Pepe and this, since most Yelpers tried the Ceci e Pepe. I am so glad we decided on the Chitarra. This was a spicy pasta dish with jalapenos, squid, dry squid, and fresh and fermented chili. The jalapenos and chili charged each bite with a kick of spice, but it is a good kind of spice. The dry squid also gave the dish a salty taste which matched the intensity of the spice. I had to drink water to calm the tastebuds a bit, but it was much worth it. If you love spicy and seafood, try this one out. The noodles are also cooked perfectly-not too soft, just right. Everything about this dish-the vibrant colors of the ingredients and the flavors really made this experience a wonderful one. BBQ Mackerel- Another dish with bold flavor. The mackerel is plated on top of soft drenched radish. I was already a bit too full to eat this. However, the fish is cooked perfectly and the meat of the fish was tender with rich flavor. It didn't taste bland and the skin is definitely edible with a smoked drizzled BBQ taste. Not a heavy entree at all. We were too full to try the dessert. This was a wonderful experience and even though we sat by the bar, the bartenders were very educated with all the dishes on the menu. Everyone was very nice and attentive, asking us constantly how was everything. The hype of Momofuku definitely has lived up to my expectations. I would definitely come back here and try the other Momofuku restaurants as well.",3,0,2,Rita L.,"Manhattan, NY",72,279,759
4.0,2/21/2016,"I had a pretty good experience here, but unfortunately it did not quite live up to the ""5 star"" memorable experience that I was hoping for. I do plan on returning here in the future once the hype dies down a little bit to try a few more dishes on the menu and do my research a little more beforehand.This place has a good overall vibe. It is communal seating with a lot of the seats on ""box"" seats that are pretty close to the ground. This was fine for me since I guess I'm considered short, but I do know my friends 6'3"" dad was a little bit uncomfortable in tight quarters! For appetizers, we got the prawns and then a tofu dish that was recommended by our waitress. These were really the biggest disappointments of the night. The tofu dish did not have a lot of flavor, and I think the texture was a little strange for most of the people in our group. The prawns were okay, but nothing particularly memorable. Maybe we misunderstood, but they were apparently supposed to be eaten whole but they were very ""shell-y"". The next part of our meal was certainly the best part. We got the chicken and dumplings and the cacio e pepe. My group was a little skeptical when I suggested the chicken and dumplings, but this ended up being everyones favorite dish of the evening. It was a great fusion of a classic dish with hints of Asian spice. The cacio was also wonderful as well - we certainly licked every last bite of the sauce. For our meat dish, we had the lamb served over beans. This was just so-so. The beans had no flavor, and the meat was just okay.Based on other reviews, it seems like there are a few other dishes that are driving the high reviews, so I will certainly return to check out a few other dishes. It seems like they are still experimenting with their menu, so there's plenty of time to improve.",1,0,1,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",100,159,301

There were four of us in our group, and the wait was long. 50 minutes. We were prepared to expect this and the dining experience definitely made the effort worth it. (Note: they just released a reservation system on their site). My one criticism that wasn't worth docking a star is that if you are expecting people to wait, a more comfortable waiting space would be great. I got trampled a bit by the very nice host because the menu storage was oddly far from the host stand.The four of us sampled nearly everything on the menu, and there wasn't a single misstep.

4.0,2/17/2016,"ahhh this is an overdue review. 4.5 stars. don't get me wrong the food was great but not all of the dishes stood out. i got there a little before 5:30 a week after the restaurant opened. thankfully by the time my friend came we didn't have to wait too long to get seated. since we dissected the menu way before we got there we knew what we wanted. we ordered sirloin crudo (appetizer), ceci e pepe, clams grand lisboa, black bass, fried fingerling, and pork shoulder. the star dishes were the sirloin crudo, ceci e pepe, and black bass. if i had known the ceci e pepe dish was that good i would have ordered an extra plate for myself! we both enjoyed the crudo. the meat basically melted in my mouth. the black bass and the sauce was delectable. i would have licked the plate clean if no one was looking.. the clams were a little too salty for our liking. my friend didn't like it because there was too much crunchy noodles (fyi - she loves to eat noodles), the pork shoulder was alright. it was a little too salty for my taste and the fried fingerling didn't stand out to me (and i love eating potatoes)!no tipping is awesome! overall, my friend and i enjoyed our meal and our stomachs were content.",2,1,3,Ruby L.,"New York, NY",121,238,640
3.0,2/16/2016,"Been here twice now. The menu definitely looks very interesting, but I feel as if the food is has not reached its full potential yet. The only dish that has really stood out to me is the Clams Lisboa. Extremely tasty and definitely worth a visit just to try that dish. The clams were much smaller the second time though, so I guess the big clams were not in season. The beef sichuan was a huge disappointment though. The flavor was very offputting and difficult to place. However, my biggest peeve is with the ceci e pepe. We were served our ceci e pepe lukewarm the first time, and it was not appealling at all. I had no experience with this dish before, and thought that the pasta was meant to be like that. But to my horror, I found out that it is most definitely served warm. I'm quite unsure how a restaurant of this caliber could have such a mistake, but I suppose I am also at fault for being such a newbie. We tried some of the other dishes too, but none of them really had a lasting impression. Mediocre experience overall that was at least punctuated by an amazing clams lisboa.",2,0,0,Timothy C.,"Manhattan, NY",15,44,0
4.0,2/15/2016,"4.5 stars for my first visit tonight. Since I only tried two dishes on the menu and still planning to go back one of these week day, I am holding off one, for now. I had debated at least 45 mins before stopping by tonight. My right brain: what if it is over-hyped, what if there is a long wait, it is raining and cold outside...and I still have work to follow up! But my left brain argues: what if, others think the same way and it is Monday. That means with fairly good chance, I may be able to snatch a seat even without reservation. So, with the help of Uber and a little gambler mentality, 20 mins later, I found myself seated at the counter of Momofuku Nishi. Apparently, some people bailed on their reservations, as the host told me. Their lost was my gain!The decoration of this space is very similar to Momofuky Noodle bar in the E.V.: simple, natural wood bench, big window but less cramped. The vibe feels more adult and less noisy. You could totally bring a low key date here. Promptly, my wine was poured and served. A very refreshing Reisling. Menu is not big, about 6 apps, 5 noodle dish plus 2 main. Yet it still took me some time to decide because everything looked quite good and unique! As reported by Eater, the concept is Italian/Asian (Korean, Japanese and Chinese) mashed-up. That reflected in the menu and item descriptions, e.g. Spicy Beef Sichuan with notes ""Ma Po Tofu x Ssam's Spicy Rice Cakes x Chili Pan Mee x Bolognese"". It is UN in a dish. Sadly, I am a petite girl with a small stomach so i had to choose. With the very helpful bar tender, I opted for the Spanish mackerel tataki with yuzu and cellery, as well as the featured dish - ceci e pepe, an adaptation from the Roman classic cacio e pepe. I like both of the dishes. But the pasta definitely edged up a tad in terms of creativity. Instead of using the traditional pecorino Romano, they used fermented chickpea paste here. I figured it may be derived from the the Japanese technique for making miso, except replacing soy with chickpea. The end product is surprisingly creamy and cheesy without actually using cheese. Cutting out trans fat and calories too, if that is your concern. And the crushed black pepper sprinkled on top of the pasta delivered great contrast to the mild sweetness of the sauce. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. It is a simple looking dish yet it delivers loads flavors!The mackerel was refreshing with a hint of smokiness. I would recommend. Overall, I had a good meal and enjoy the experiences here. Even in a foodie city like NYC, it is rare to find restaurant that is innovative AND executes well. Finally, a Momofuku restaurant that does not disappoint. You bet I will be back soon.P.S. The no tipping rule is real.",3,0,0,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",126,298,1138

4.0,2/12/2016,"Dinner here was really good, although I wasn't quite blown away. It seems like they're still experimenting a lot -- some of the most popular items from the Yelp pics had changed already (eg the scallops were replaced with black bass). We got two appetizers and two entrees. The entrees were good, but the apps were really the show stoppers -- the black bass was great, and the beef crudo was really outstanding. Of the two entrees, I (surprisingly) liked the beef sichuan more than than the ceci e pepe, although my wife thought the reverse. Both were very good, and you can definitely tell the difference between a typical cacio e pepe and Nishi's chickpea version -- it might simply be personal tastes (I highly prefer Italian flavored to Asian ones) that stopped me from truly being blown away by these dishes.

4.0,2/12/2016,"Torn...conflicted, a bit confused. I've followed David Chang since his start up at Momofuku and all the crazy shit he does there! When I learned about this culinary experiment in Chelsea it was bookmarked. I figured it would never be a reality to land a table...lines around the block were common. I'm diehard, but i was a bit skeptical. It was Super Bowl sunday, so i banked on it being ""slower"" than normal--but this is NYC, foodies never stop. My group of 3 managed to get in line about 35 minutes before the 5:30pm opening. We were 6th in line!!! We ""made it"" and were 99.99% sure we got seats. The line started to wrap around the block as time inched towards 5:30pm. We didn't get the best seats... but we still got seats! They were near the door which caused cold drafts to come in during our dining experience. It wasn't horrible, but be aware that it happens...winter sucks. The menu has changed a bit since i last seen during opening night/week. Chang did say he was gonna be mixing the menu up so i expected it. Since it was Chinese New Year, we decided to just order everything to celebrate and experience the full culinary palette the restaurant had to offer. -spanish mackeral -sirloin crudo-ceci e pepi-clams grand lisboa-spicy beef sichuan-pork shoulder white kim chi-xo escarole-finger potatoes-sweet potato anchovy-liter house red wineService was really good... as expected. Sorry, I forgot your name! Lilly? Laura? I thought they would give us chop sticks, but you have to request it. I don't like using a fork to poke (raw) fish as it ruins the integrity of the product. The spanish mackeral was by far my favorite. The fish had a hint of smokey flavor and the yuzu gave it really good flavor. The house red was a bit spicier than i liked...almost like a sharaz--i forgot to ask. My cousin commented on how the place felt more like a ""test kitchen"" ... an experimental laboratory. The interior is barebones, minimal, clean lines. I think he's right. The flavor profiles and ingredients range from all across the globe. My taste buds got beat up because you expect one thing, and get another. Sometimes pleasant surprises, other times not so much. I'm torn... I commend Chang's vision to push the envelop with food and service (no tipping), but the dining experience left me really confused when we left. At first, i feel like saying ""i've experienced it, and i don't need to try it again; one and done""...but something makes me want to go again and chase a new experience? It wasn't a horrible meal, but it wasn't one of my best. However, it was great to experience something new in the crazy NYC food scene.

Don't order the Mackerel it's too fishy.For appetizer we ordered the shrimp and they recommend eating it with the shell (which I find strange) it was spiced up nicely but not enough meat in them since they were about pinky length.Must order: ceci Pepe - at first glance I thought it was so plain but when you actually eat it it's amazing. The thick noodles is a nice touch as well.,0,0,0,Saba S.,"Manhattan, NY",261,36,106
4.0,2/9/2016,"My favorite of Chang's restaurants to date.  DECOR: 7/10It's stylistically very similar--if not identical--to his other restaurants both in design with its wood-laden minimalism and in concept with its exclusive use of communal tables.  This can be frustrating if you don't like sitting 8 inches from a stranger, but this is a a popular place run by a famous chef in NYC, so it's hard to expect otherwise.  Also, note, this place is LOUD.FOOD: 8/10I was initially skeptical of getting the Ceci e Pepe, but the noodles were of such great quality and the flavor of the chickpea hozon was so unexpected, I was mad at myself for ever considering passing it up.Spicy Beef Sichuan was another quality dish.  Again, excellent form on the noodles.  The perfect balance of spice.  And a great meat-to-noodle ratio.  An underrated dish based on the reviews that preceded my visit.The Sirloin Crudo is the reason you don't see a 10 above.  More like roast beef than anything else.  I'm sure if I shelled out the $45 for the truffles, I'd have a different opinion, but I didn't.  I'd say this was skippable.And, last, the Panna Cotta.  This was outstanding.  The plum vinegar adds a savory complexity to the tartness of the dish's dairy in an unexpected and exciting way.  I could have eaten two of them myself.  Definitely get more than one if you plan to share with more than two people.DRINK: 7/10I didn't try any of the craft cocktails, so I can only comment on the beer selection.  This was all fine and good with a handful of decent choices, but they have nothing on draft.  $8-9 for a can just feels wrong.  If it were a draft, I wouldn't bat an eye.SERVICE: 9/10Everyone was very welcoming and super attentive.  I didn't have to pour myself a drink once, despite the place being packed.PRICE: 8/10$106 for all of the food above and two beers.  Not a bad deal at all.  Happy to pay it.  One thing to note: the dishes may look expensive on the menu, but, with tip included, I found them actually to all be really fair.  Will go back--if I can ever get in again.",0,0,0,Wes F.,"New York, NY",29,121,40
4.0,2/8/2016,"This Korean-Italian fusion restaurant by David Chang under the Momofuku brand is definitely a place I would suggest checking out if the wait is not too bad or you can book yourself a reservation through their website.  This is a pretty small place and is generally difficult to seat parties larger than four.  Even if the website mentions that there are no open reservations, you can still walk-in and wait.  I came here with a group of five people and the wait was around 1.5 hours.  But hey, we wanted to try this place out so we stuck it out and enjoyed a good meal.Take note that it does seem some of the menu changes here and there, but I think there are a few platters that consistently remain on the menu.  As for appetizers, my friends and I shared the Black Bass which is in a greenish sauce that contains tiger's milk and Shio kombu,  The bass was very good, and since this was shared with five people, I was tempted to get another order to try.My main dish was the Ceci e Pepe pasta and that has chickpea hozon and black pepper.  I really enjoyed this dish of pasta.  Yes it is small, but the buttery flavor was perfect for this dish.  I was pleasantly surprised that I loved this dish as much as I did.  My friends got other menu items which included the Chicken and Dumpling soup, BBQ Mackerel with Daikon, Pork Shoulder with White Kimchi, and the Spicy Beef Sichuan which uses flat noodles and had mushrooms.  I was able to try a bite of all of these other dishes and I enjoyed the Chicken and Dumpling Soup and BBQ Mackerel the most.  The soup had a very complex flavor and the BBQ Mackerel was cooked very well.  I typically do not eat Daikon either due to its very strong taste but how this was cooked I could eat more than I usually do. Overall, if you can get a reservation here I would definitely check this place out.  I would personally go with more of the pasta options since it is cheaper as they sufficiently satisfy my taste buds!   For me, if I had one of the meat / fish platters I would definitely want to have more due to the small serving size and at the same time, it is much more pricier.  I would rather share three cheaper pasta dishes than get just two expensive entree dishes for around the same price.FYI: There is no tipping allowed here, so that can be seen as why the price is higher as well.",5,1,3,Nobel V.,"Nutley, NJ",1002,315,1318

4.0,2/1/2016,"A solid 4 stars. Sorry for ruining the average, everyone.As the new kid on the block, Momofuku Nishi didn't take reservations in their opening weeks, so we had to get in line around 5:30pm (starting Feb. 1, they will take reservations through their proprietary system). When we arrived, the line already wrapped around the block, and we didn't make the first dinner shift, but they took our name and number down, and told us it would be about 2 hours. Went back to my apartment, and thankfully, we only had to wait about an hour until we were texted. They'll hold your table for about 10 minutes, so it's important not to be too far away, and make sure that if you're at a bar, your tabs are all closed out, so you don't lose your spot. The inside is very similar to Ssäm Bar and Noodle Bar, with the austere wooden tables and chairs. There's a likely chance you'll have to share a table with other parties, as the seating is pretty limited and demand is high, so this place might not be the best for talking confidential or private subjects. Onto the food. Everything was great. We started off with the special: amaebi, aka spot prawns in dashi with basil oil and lemongrass. This was likely one of the most unique dishes I had ever tried; the prawns had such a creamy texture that I actually quite enjoyed, but I failed to taste any of the basil oil or lemongrass. Next, we had the sirloin beef crudo with watermelon radish, blackened scallion, and chives. Very artfully prepared, the crudo was very tender, and it contrasted very well with the crunchiness of the chive and radish. Next up was fried whole shrimp, unpeeled, covered in salt and pepper. The flavors were delicious, but I wouldn't quite recommend this dish, since the shrimp were tiny, and you're better off getting salt and pepper shrimp at any Chinese takeout place. Finally, we ended with the ceci e pepe, which was a take on cacio e pepe, using chickpea hozon (sort of like miso) instead of parmesan. That was legit one of the best pastas I've ever had, and the hozon was very unique. I would eat a large bowl of that, over and over. As is the case with most Momofuku slash David Chang restaurants, the value is pretty hard to find. It seems like Nishi is supposed to be a very casual eatery, and while the vibe is just that, I think that the price points are just a bit too high. Not only that, some of the dishes changed radically from the opening weeks, so as to exclude some premium ingredients like black truffle, which you can now add as a supplement for the low, low price of $49. Kind of a bait-and-switch strategy if you ask me, but to be fair, everything we had was still great, and regardless, the quality of food is definitely up there. Additionally, the service is excellent, and the waitstaff seems to be genuinely stoked to be salaried, and not living off of tips.If you haven't tried Momofuku Nishi yet, it's definitely worth a try, because the dishes are delicious and unique. Would I come back? Yes, but only without a wait. As I said before, I could probably eat bowls and bowls of that ceci e pepe, but I don't know if I'd wait for an hour+ again for it. In all, it's actually a good place for a casual dinner, as long as you're willing to pay a bit more for it.",55,34,52,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

However, me and my friends left the place and placed an order on seamless because we were neither full nor satisfied. Not worth the hype, seriously. All dishes were way too ""sweet"". I read so much about the pasta dishes all over food blogs, newspapers etc and I gotta say I'm really disappointed. The place has a weird vibe too.

The chicken noodle soup was packed with new fun flavor, the romaine salad was off the hook. The clams were one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. The lamb dish was OK I was hoping for more flavor then I got but overall if that was the weakest link they're still doing something right. Then there's the pistachio Bundt cake, that was simply sinful. You must get that. The service was amazing they were insightful and quick. I had no problems with anything that I had tonight, it all was all amazing. The only thing that I found unexpected was that they didn't have coffee or tea.

We put our names on the list at 7:30 (rookie mistake, I know.) We waited for 3 hours in total, but thankfully 2 of those were at a nearby bar since they have the table texting service. The last hour was made bearable by having Jean-Georges and crew standing next to us & just watching David Chang walk back and forth through the restaurant like he owned the place (oh wait, he does.) Once we finally got seated, we went straight to ordering half the menu. The trout entree was delicious (never had it prepared that way). The tofu and salmon roe was so balanced in flavor and texture profile (genius comes from the ability to capture simplicity), and of course the Ceci e Pepe delivered on all fronts and expectations. Definitely need to come back to try the other half of the menu & also cocktails.The service was so attentive and beyond professional. Of course, only expect the best from the Momofuku team.

5.0,1/29/2016,"David Chang's newest venture is this Korean-Italian destination. While pricier than other Chang standards, Nishi is a no-tipping establishment which is a refreshing change of pace-hopefully one that is gathering more steam in the restaurant industry. Our first meal here was impeccable, from the service to the food.We had the Beef Crudo, Chicken and Dumplings, Spicy Sichuan Noodles, and Ceci e Pepe. We also made friends with the awesome diners sitting next to us who had us try their Clams Grand Lisboa and Fried Fingerling Potatoes! Everything we tasted was incredible. The pastas were both perfectly cooked and had very different flavor profiles: The Spicy Sichuan has the heat, and the Ceci e Pepe is a sweet, buttery bowl of heaven. The Crudo is beautiful to look at and even more pleasing to taste with watermelon radish for a hint of acidity and ponzu. Chicken and Dumplings was like the best bowl of soup you've ever had, very rich and mushroom-heavy, which I love. To drink I had the Blood Orange Daiquiri which was good, but literally only filled up 1/3 of the glass, so it kind of felt like getting swindled out of 14 bucks. (Would not recommend.) However, we had to wait 20 minutes for our last dish to come out because the kitchen was in a frenzy, so our waitress offered us both glasses of red wine to compensate. Take notes, other restaurants... this is how you make customers happy! David Chang himself was also in the house tonight, which was both nerve-wracking and exciting. Another big success for DC I would say.",3,1,4,Jessica G.,"Manhattan, NY",263,107,189
5.0,1/28/2016,"Really enjoyed my experience tonight minus the 1.5 hour wait for a table. I killed some time drinking some super cheap beers at Dallas BBQ two blocks away. In terms of decor, it is virtually identical to all of his other restaurants. David Chang was actually sitting one table next to me which was pretty sweet. It is always awesome to see the man behind the magic. He was definitely checking in with his maitre'd, waiters and going to certain tables to check on the guest experience. I had the black bass appetizer to start which was good but not mind blowing. Next time, I would try the tofu with the roe. I don't even like tofu but after seeing a picture of it and having the waitress describe it, I will certainly try it on my next visit. I loved the Clams Grand Lisboa dish. The crunchy  yet almost charred Fideos-like noodles sat in a delicious herbaceous broth topped with some very juicy clams. Really loved this dish because it was totally unique and unlike any other pasta dish I had tried before. I also loved the Spicy Beef Sichuan Pappardelle. Just like it sounds, it combines the tender spicy beef with delectable fresh house-made wide noodles.  For those who like Bolognese, this is a fun dish that packs a lot of flavor and a little punch. My friend has the lamb that was perfectly cooked and very flavorful, but not wow factor status. Also the red haired Maitre'd gave us a free pistachio bundt cake, which was not too sweet and had a mascarpone cream on the side. I like desserts that are not too sweet, so for me this was . She was very knowledgeable and thoughtful, so thank you! I think the portion size is very nice and for about 55 dollars a head, I had a beer, split an appetizer and a pasta. As mentioned in other reviews, there is a no tipping policy, which I love.  For New York and for a restaurant this trendy, I think that is very reasonable. Don't get me wrong, there are a few kinks to work out but that is the case with every NYC restaurant in its first month.

5.0,1/27/2016,"I was the first in line to get in! Hardly waited.  But on my way out by 7:15PM, the place was full and buzzing with some 20 people waiting.I sat by the bar attended by a friendly and informative bar tender. Watching her whip one drink after another was great to see and learn what each drink on their list appeared to look like. Educational for ordering drinks in the future.I started with the beef crudo with watermelon radish and dashi ponzu.  It's special if you opt it with fresh shaved black truffle.  The truffle was veined in appearance because this variety is from Spain.My favorite dish is the Ceci-e Peppe (a take from the Italian dish Caccio -e Pepe) with chick pea hozon sauce and black pepper.  It has no dairy and yet it's almost like it did.  I could eat another bowl of this.  I took some of the truffles from my crudo beef to put on top of my pasta - the Ceci-e Peppe. The pasta is perfectly cooked al dente.I was getting full but I wanted to try another dish instead of dessert.  I then, ordered the black bass with tiger's milk and shio kombu.  Tiger's milk is that ingredient in Peruvian dishes.  This dish is like a sashimi with light green sauce made with tiger's milk and with a hint tiny specs of shio kombu on top of each piece of raw fish.I look forward to going back as I had such a positive experience in taste, and service!Best of all, I don't have to calculate on tipping.  You will find it written at the bottom of their menu and on your bill: !no tipping please!

3.0,1/23/2016,"The hype train is rolling into the station...Nishi was pretty good, but definitely not the unanimous five-star quality that is being listed here.  It's early in the life of this restaurant, but there are still plenty of kinks to work out.  For example, only certain parties are given wine lists, while others are only given cocktail lists.  Thanks to communal tables, I could clearly see the party next to us receive both the cocktail and wine list right off the bat, and when I asked for one, I was simply told the cocktail menu was the extent of the offering--is that some sort of customer profiling at work?  How were some tables drinking full bottles?  I really like the beverage director, Jordan, and her array of choices, so that was actually one reason to check this place out.  But fine, if you don't want me to order a bottle for whatever reason, I'll go with cocktails. But even on the cocktails, they were hit or miss.  For example, the limoncello slush was a well balanced treat, but the amaro affogato slush had a really weird aftertaste, smacking of either low quality amaro or some other off balance ingredients.The food had some highs and lows too.  The often spotlighted Grand Clams Lisboa was interesting, but it literally came with two clams, so the dish was basically just oily overcooked noodles.  I was hoping the Spicy Beef Sichuan Pappardelle would tickle my fancy in the same way as the Momofuku classic Spicy Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes dish, but it simply was not even close to as good as the original.  I really wanted to like these more noodle-centric dishes, but it just wasn't working for me compared to your more ""normal"" Momofuku offerings.  We had a few other items too, but the only thing that was really great was the smoked trout -- it was simple, smokey, and flavorful.Will I go back?  Sure, just once they can figure out what they are doing service-wise and what food is working in the kitchen.  I'm a huge Momofuku fan (with several trips to every other NYC location under my belt), so I plan on not giving up on this one.  However, to consider this to be the perfect five star spot at this point is simply silly--you really are better off just waiting a while for the team to hit their stride and hitting up Ssam Bar, Noodle Bar, Ma Peche, or Ko in the meantime for something you can actually count on.",9,1,2,Julie M.,"New York, NY",256,553,27

Atmosphere is communal tables, minimal decor, and bad accoustics. Honestly, it was hard to hear my date and he was sitting right across from me.Food: amazing. Chicken and dumpling soup was great.

I guess I should start with the walking up to the obscure nameless restaurant with the only sign of a small peach by the door to symbolize David Chang's newest hot spot! I loved the ambience of the wood panel mixed with tile floor. I was with a party of 6 and we were seated and given a small explanation of the menu. We started with an array of alcoholic drinks. I had the Alsatian and I loved it. Others in the party had the limoncello slurpee and the mountainside and enjoyed them greatly. I urge you to try every appetizer because each one is unique. The whole shrimp was a surprising favorite (eat shell and all) and the beef carpaccio was an explosion of flavor! Next was our primi dishes! The bucatini in the ceci e pepe was the table favorite!!! The pasta was cooked perfectly with the most amazing seasoning. The pasta in all the dishes was incredible with amazing taste and perfect Italian consistency. With sides like fingerling potatoes and sweet potatoes the meal was inventive and left everyone with a full stomach and the taste buds in culinary heaven.

So I would suggest either getting here really early or just wait until 7ish and put your name down so you can walk around. Things we ordered:- Beef crudo - Definitely get this if you like beef. My friend and I both enjoyed this. The beef was sliced super thin and the ponzu sauce was delicious. We didn't get this with black truffles but I guess you can if you want to splurge.- Black Bass - Sadly, it wasn't scallops when we went but this was still good. Fish was very fresh. -Ceci e pepe - Yup, just order this. This has no cheese in it but the chickpea give it this delicious flavor that mimics cheese. -Clams Grand Lisboa - The clams were cooked perfectly but I found the broth to be way too salty. Part of the noodles were crunchy. -Pork shoulder- I didn't enjoy this dish. The white kimchi was way too pickled for my taste and the pork didn't taste like anything special. Should've tried the mackerel instead! - Fried fingerling - My friend is the potato expert, but she only said this was okay.

5.0,1/18/2016,"It was destiny that Momofuku Nishi opened a couple of days before I came to visit NYC. I am a huge fan of the Momofuku/David Chang restaurants and could not WAIT to try this place out. My cousin, bestie from college, and I came here Saturday at around 6:30 pm. We didn't even have to see the restaurant, we saw the line around the corner first and just got in it. It wasn't too long, but it is a line just to put your name down. The wait was estimated to be about 2.5-3 hours, and you better believe we waited. It was more of a 3 hour and 15 minute wait, but at that point, the anticipation kept us from getting too grumpy. If you think you can come in at 9:30-10pm ish and the wait will be less, nope. The host was already turning people away, cheerfully telling them they were full for the night and would open again Tuesday at 6 pm. We were finally seated at the bar where the bartender/our waitress immediately greeted us and asked what kind of water we wanted. She explained the menu a little to us. We all ordered drinks. My cousin got the limencello slushie, which was super refreshing and not as sweet as I thought would be. My bestie got the vinsanto wine, a wine from Santorini made out of raisins and is SUPER sweet, but still delicious. I got the blood orange cocktail, which I wasn't a huge fan of. It had a huge cinnamon undertone that reminded me of Fireball (something I no longer can even smell without gagging). I was a little disappointed in it and didn't think the cinnamon and blood orange went together very well. But eh.For food, we decided to all share and get 3 appetizers, 3 noodles, and a side dish. We were a littttttle too ambitious, especially since we got 3 noodle dishes and the fingerling potatoes side dish. Not the smartest move on our part, but definitely the most delicious. The appetizers came out fairly quickly and one after the other. We got the tofu with smoked trout roe, the steak crudo, and the seabass with tiger milk. The steak crudo was the best of the appetizers. I don't normally like raw meat like that, but WOW. It melted in your mouth, the flavors all blended well together, and you couldn't taste any iron-y or bloody flavors. It was excellent. The sea bass was refreshing and light. The tiger milk was smooth and had a tangy kick to it. I loved it. The tofu was some of the smoothest tofu I have ever had. It was a tad bit too salty for me, but I still enjoyed it. The first noodles that came out was the Ceci e Pepe. It has a simple but classy presentation. This was some of the FRESHEST black pepper I have ever tasted. I like spicy food, and I'm a little embarrassed to say, but the black pepper definitely gave it a REALLY spicy kick. It surprisingly did not overpower the dish. It was also very filling. The next dishes came out very slowly. Apparently our waitress had them bring out the noodle dishes one at a time for some reason? It was a little weird, and the wait time in between each food was longer than I'd like for a 5 star restaurant. But the food is seriously worth the wait. The chicken and dumplings came out next. It was an interesting take on chicken and dumplings and very filling as well. I loved the shittake mushrooms and was glad to see how well they incorporated it into the dish. It also had that black pepper spicy kick to it, but I couldn't get enough of it. The fingerling potatoes were hands down, some of the best potatoes I've ever had. I never would have thought to mix smoked yolk and tarragon together. The tarragon was AMAZING and put those potatoes over the top. I was so full, but I still kept shoving potatoes into my mouth. It was seriously that good. The Spicy Beef Sichuan had more of that hot pepper spicy to it. The flat noodles were good, but in general, it was an average dish. I love spicy beef noodles, and this wasn't the best I ever had, although still decent. We didn't have to pay tip, I guess the prices include tip. That was definitely unique. The food here is well worth the wait. Seriously. It's a foodie's heaven in here. It is small and almost has the same layout as the noodle bar. I do wish I had a chance to try the desserts, but we were all so full to the point, we were struggling not to fall asleep or lie down right there on the restaurant floor. I was hoping they would have some stuff from Milk Bar available. Service was amazing. Our plates were changed after the appetizers so flavors wouldn't mix. Our waitress was patient with us when we asked her to take our picture during a super busy time. I would skip the tofu and the spicy beef sichuan noodles next time, but everything else I would get it again in a heart beat. I'm not a fan of raw seafood or beef, but those two dishes have literally converted me to try more of it. I would suggest getting here early, like before they open even.

5.0,1/17/2016,"Momofuku Nishi lived up to the hype and delivered a great dining experience in its first week of existence.  Four people shared the list of items below and it was the right amount of food.  We were stuffed but ate everything.The cece e pepe really stood out.  It's made with a fermented chickpea paste developed by the momofuku lab (hozon) instead of cheese, however, it tastes a lot like cheese!  it's pretty mind-blowing in a mad scientist way because they may have created something that tastes better than cheese.  Clams were also very good.  Six or so littlenecks atop chow mein noodles (some of them fried to crispy) in a sauce that makes you want to lick the bowl. The clams had a touch of sauce but only so much that you could still taste the natural brine of the clam. It all went together very well.I haven't seen anyone else note that this place is a NO TIPPING restaurant.  Everything is included in the prices.  It's nice to not have to do math at the end.apps:sirloin crudosea bass w/ tiger's milkromaine bagna càudamyün (I don't know what myün means but think primi)cece e pepeclams grand lisboasquid w/ lo mein and jalapenoentreés:bbq mackerel prime rib",8,1,7,Mike T.,"Brooklyn, NY",566,187,201
5.0,1/16/2016,"As Nishi just opened on our block, we decided we had to see what all the fuss was about. In short: It's worth the hype!The space is pretty no-frills, with communal tables and a modern Japanese (with perhaps a hint of Scandinavian?) wood finish. Staff are gracious and engaging. Elisabeth was serving us, was fully on top of things, and never seemed rushed while still having to deal with a full house.Food arrived very quickly. We started with the Ceci e Pepe, a take on the classic Roman pasta, here amazingly made without parmesan, but with chickpea chozon instead. Light, unique flavor. Brilliant, a serious win. Get this for sure.The mackerel was perfectly BBQ'd with a lightly sweet sauce brushed over top. One of my favourite Japanese dishes (as one might find in a quality establishment in Kyoto), here done to perfection, sitting on a bed of daikon infused with a light fish sauce. Wow. If it's on the menu (they seem to be switching up the entrees quite a bit), you like fish, and adore umami flavor--this is a must.The escarole dish with the restaurant's trademark XO sauce was great, but less remarkable than the above two. If you love bitter greens, do it.Finally, the pistachio bundt cake was fantastic. Rich, nutty, just the right density but not too sweet, matched perfectly with what seemed to be a dollop of panna cotta. Oh yes--the sparkling water was just right, only lightly bubbly, the right level of fizz to have in decent amount with a meal, and glasses stayed full throughout.Overall--and excellent experience. On top of that, I was surprised how modest the bill was (service is 100% included here). Will be back when the crowds thin a little bit, or they start taking reservations. Or sooner. :-)",1,0,1,Jan J.,"New York, NY",280,37,68
5.0,1/14/2016,"I thought I should wait a bit to go here, but I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Also my friend lives right down the block, so I figured if we had a long wait we could at least wait there.  I went yesterday (Wednesday) and got there around 6:10.  The line was to the corner of 22nd and 8th, so not that bad.  They opens at 6, so they were seating people slowly and then when they were filled they would take names.  Luckily both my friend and I were there and we were seated when we got up to the front.  It was probably overall a 20 min wait.  The place is a good size.  We were seated in the front at one of the low communal tables.  There are 6 seats at each of those tables and we were sat in the middle across from each other.  It was close, you could hear everyone's conversation around you, but I didn't feel like they were eating right on top of me.  The place was noisy though, so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders. I just went with a glass of the house white.  It was sweeter than I thought it would be, but it was still good.  My friend had ordered the limoncello slushi, but they came back and told us it wasn't ready yet, so he went with the blood orange daquiri.  We had looked over the food menu and thought about what we had wanted.  We also heard a few recommendations from the waitress, and then made our decisions.  We decided to go with 5 small plates and no entrée, and it proved to be a good idea.  We ordered the sirloin crudo.  I've never been a big fan of tartare, or carpaccio (I like my fish raw, not my meat) but my friend wanted to try it and it was a suggested plate to get, so we did.  It was pretty good, and I had some, but I let my friend finish it.  If you like raw meat, I think you'd like it.  We didn't add on truffles to anything because I HATE them, but for an additional price you could add it this and the chicken and dumplings soup.  We got the shaved winter vegetables, which are pickeled and served in a beef broth.  I liked it, the presentation was pretty and it was light and refreshing.  Another one from the appetizer section we got was the tofu.  I really liked this one!  The tofu was so smooth and creamy!  The trout roe on top was really fishy tasting, but I liked it.  I finished that one off while my friend finished off the crudo.  Win-win!  Next up was the ceci e pepe, which was probably one of my favorites. The pasta was so good, and chickpea hozon (whatever that it) was amazing.  I'm not a huge black pepper person, but I even enjoyed that on top too.  Last up we got the chicken and dumplings.  I really liked this as well.  My friend wasn't as big of a fan.  It was served in a thick broth with chicken, thick noodles and mushrooms (which I did not eat) and had a bit of a spicy kick to it.  We thought about dessert, but we were both stuffed, so maybe next time.  Overall I really enjoyed Nishi!  Everything we ordered was really good.  My friend doesn't love fish, so there were a few dishes I'd like to go back another time and try.  Service was good, everyone seemed very friendly and attentive - clearing plates and making sure everything was ok.  Pricewise I didn't think it was too bad either.  For a drink and a satisfying meal it came to about $70 per person (no tipping it's all included), which isn't crazy for a nice meal in NYC.  I definitely plan to go back at some point!",33,14,26,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541
5.0,1/12/2016,"Nishi had the grand opening on Jan 9th, heard of its opening on Jan 10th, they close on Jan 11th (Monday) and here I came on Jan 12th. Apparently not everything was completely ready yet (as you could tell from their website, which still has lots of pending areas); however no one would say no to any one of David Chang's new debuts. Also, they currently only accept for walk-in, so clean up your belly and show up will be good enough.Having said that, my friend and I came around 7:00 and the place was completely packed. Our approximate waiting time is 1.5 hour to 2 hours, impressive! After we eventually settled down, we shared two appetizers (sirloin crudo and raw scallop), one main dish (BBQ fish), one starch (Sichuan pork noodles) and finally, the pistachio bundt cake. My personal favorite was for sure the spicy noodles, but each single dish was simply amazing and had absolutely no miss!I think another main reason I'm so into Nishi is that it perfectly combined a high-end flavor with a down-to-earth presentation. Given enough $$$, one would certainly spend nights and nights at Per Se, yet I'd rather drop money at Nishi/Fuku, where I could have a true relax.",16,10,13,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633
5.0,1/11/2016,"As usual with anything David Chang/Momofuku related, there is a lot of hype, and it is well-deserved.I'm not sure how much the all day reporting on Eater contributes to it, but on the first two nights of service there was already a line around the corner well before the restaurant opened. Once 6 PM hit, they slowly started letting in a few people at a time.It's mostly communal seating with a few elevated 4-tops off to the sides and some bar seating toward the back, making it feel pretty similar to the Noodle Bar set up.Sure, it feels a little silly to line up waiting for a restaurant to open, especially when the crotchety old people living nearby in Chelsea constantly walk by asking what the line is for and shaking their heads at you, but there is an undeniable excitement about it that makes for a different experience than strolling in months later after all of the reviews and hype has died down.Once seated, I made sure to try to order fast, which was a good strategy since I could tell things would move pretty slowly as they were obviously completely slammed. Some courses took quite a long time to arrive, but it was worth it as the food was incredible and the atmosphere was fun and lively enough to distract from the wait. Communal seating can be a real crap shoot since you can get screwed and sit next to some awful people, but we happened to luck out and sit next to two very pleasant guys, which can make a world of difference, since you are so close to each other that you are basically eating together after you strike up the inevitable conversation.Before you wonder where the Chili Lobster and soon to be famous Scallop dishes are on the list below, I will sadly remind you that I am allergic to shellfish and about ready to take some of these dishes to go and eat them in the ER with an epi-pen at the ready. Anyway, here's everything we are:- Romaine & Walnut Bagna Cauda ($14)This was a delicious, refreshing way to start in preparation for all of the rich, meaty stuff to come. Kind of like a take on a Caesar salad, it's a good starye- Chicken & Dumplings ($26)This was the longest pause, as our server and a few other staff members came by multiple times to assure us that the food would be right out. At last it arrived, and surprisingly, it was probably the best dish of the night. Everything in here from the chicken to the noodles to the broth was so addictive that we had to eat/drink every last bite/drop.- Ceci e Pepe ($23)Guaranteed to be on every table, this take on Cacio e Pepe with their fermented chickpea hozon in place of parmesan was excellent. It certainly did have a unique taste, very different than the Cacio e Pepe that the bowl of pasta resembles, and is a must order.- Spicy Beef Sichuan ($25)Another excellent pasta, the pappardelle noodles were also perfect, and the spicy beef was rather spicy. Very different from the Ceci e Pepe, this is a great one to order as well for some contrast.- Smoked Trout ($38)Served with the full head looking up at you, this fish was the definite winner for the choice of entrees. I rejoiced upon seeing that the fish was boneless, as I am lazy and have no patience for picking bones out of my mouth, so this was a very pleasant and satisfying main course.- Pork Shoulder ($36)Topped with White Kimchi, the fatty slices of pork were delicious. I would still probably rather go with say 3 of the pasta dishes instead of 2 entrees though to make for a more interesting meal.- Fried Fingerling & Smoked Yolk & Tarragon ($10)These weren't my favorite as the flavor was a little too subtle and the potatoes weren't as crispy as I hoped. The Grilled Sweet Potato & Anchovy sounds and looks like it might be a better option.- Pistachio Bundt Cake ($10)This is an excellent slice of cake, but not as rich and sweet as the typical Milk Bar desserts that are served at Noodle Bar and the ornate plates from Ssam Bar. The cake definitely needs the thick scoop of ricotta served alongside it, as it is a bit plain without it, but makes for a perfect bite when eaten with a little smeared on.Yes, the prices are pretty high, and higher than normal for a Momofuku restaurant to account for the new no-tipping trend they've adopted here. But if you avoid the entrees like a lot of people seem to be suggesting and stick with the pastas and small plates, you can definitely make a very satisfying, memorable meal without dropping a too unreasonable amount of money.I will admit that for these types of giant openings, I tend not to go back for a long time since it can be a bit of a chore and a stressful time landing a seat, but given Chang's recent propensity for dropping surprises and introducing new menu items and changes all the time, I can definitely see myself feeling the need to return soon.",44,24,29,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
5.0,1/9/2016,"Went here opening night because I'm a (somewhat self loathing) hypebeast of everything momofuku*. As much as it pains me to say something lives up to the hype, this place manages it. The food is definitely good and the service was top notch. Other reviews will give you a the requisite iPhone shots and effusive enthusiasm and detail of the dishes (Ceci e Pepe was the highlight) but take it from me: while the amount of pre-opening hype this place received made me (almost) want to NOT like it** it was really, really good. So if you're thinking about it, definitely go, but be prepared for a wait, because this place will be hopping for a while, but I'll definitely be coming back here with all of my friends.*anyone who's waited for a streetwear drop will know the ""man look at all these hypebeasts--wait--I AM ONE OF THESE HYPEBEASTS"" feeling**David chang's PR team needs a raise because eater would not shut up about this place--I counted 6 separate posts In a single day. Come up for air once in a while guys.",7,5,1,Adam S.,"Manhattan, NY",106,31,0
5.0,1/8/2016,"David Chang does it again, opening night on 1-9-2016 we actually got to see him at the restaurant which was amazing. Okay onto the food, we got the house wine which is a pinot, which complimented the seafoods we got. We tried the clams and mackerel. The clams are served as a noodle dish (on the bottom) and it is a saltier dish, primarily with the soy sauce marinade but I am a big fan of this. The clams have a very unique flavor, i forget the different sauces in it but the cook was perfect and the clams very tender. The mackerel was great too, the sweet sauce was slightly overpowering but overall a great dish. We had sirloin crudo which has black truffle and watermelon radish. I have never even heard of this kind of radish but this dish really comes together and the truffles were a perfect compliment to the different flavors in the dish. We also ordered spicy beef and hanger steak, the beef was really good and has a crunch texture as part of the recipe, I'm not entirely sure what is in it but it was a good addition. The steak comes with chinese broccoli and I thought that with the sweet potato side we ordered was a healthy compliment. The broccoli has a sweet sauce and the steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare. The sweet potato has a TON of different flavor profiles, its really something you have to try in order to experience it, as no words can adequately describe it. I will say however that it is a bit spicy becaues of some peppers but I highly recommend it.We had both desserts that are offered, the panna cotta and the bundt cake. I personally liked the cake more as it was really flaky and very flavorful. The panna cotta was super light, just the way it should be. I would give this a 4.5/5 overall, and there is no tip as the restaurant is structured. So total it was only 61$ a person for EVERYTHING. It's a great value that you wont find in many places.",7,3,2,Xi L.,"New York, NY",176,484,179
