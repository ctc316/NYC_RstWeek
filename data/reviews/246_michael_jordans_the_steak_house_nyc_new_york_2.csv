1.0,12/7/2018,"Had low expectations for a place in Grand Central but this place went below and beyond. Horrible, slow and inattentive service. Took forever to get a drink and literally 20 minutes to just get the check. A lot of bartenders but all incompetent, slow and unprofessional. Poorly managed place, won't return.",0,0,0,E.

1.0,12/2/2018,"The worst experience I have ever had I booked my reservation at the grand central location in nyc for my sons birthday and by the way I'm not from nyc I took a flight for a day to come to this place all the way from Los Angeles and when I showed up 10 min earlier then my reservation the bartender with a attitude tells me there kitchen has been closed for 9 months and I thought he was joking so He wasn't joking so I asked for the manager right away to find out if this is true I called the restaurant the same number I booked the reservations a month before spoke to the manager and he told me the same the kitchen has been closed for 9 months why would they take my reservation ? He had no accommodations for me and my family of 7 and he was very unprofessional running a restaurant and then the bartender told me go to capital grill and I'm thinking to my self I flew over 3,000 miles to come here for my family and this is happening I know I will be contacting corporate or somebody to get to the bottom of this and take this matter seriously cause I didn't spend my money and time to come all the way here and not get no respect or the service I should have !!!",0,1,0,Peaches S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1

1.0,6/16/2018,"My friend and I have come twice just to get the glitter drinks and both times now they said they didn't have it. The first time my friend sat waiting for me for a bit and double checked with the waiter to make sure they had the drinks and he said yes, but then all of a sudden when I came and it was time to order, they said they didn't have the glitter to make the drinks. Okay, that's fine, but you could've said that before we wasted our time. The next time we went to try the drinks, my friend called the day before to make sure they would have the drinks before we made the trek over and they said yes we will make sure we have it. But, lo and behold, when we got there the next day, they again ""didn't have the ingredients.""

3.0,2/10/2018,"It's been a place I always wanted to try when I looked at the restaurant week list. It was decent, not the best steakhouse. The location is interesting with the restaurant being inside Grand Central, but that might be why it's a tourist trap. I don't know if it's because we had the restaurant week menu, but the steak we had wasn't that great. The medium and the medium rare my friend ordered were both very overcooked. The cheesecake was really big but size isn't worth the taste. The oyster appetizer was delicious though; it was the only memorable part of the meal.",2,0,1,Sharon K.,"New York, NY",168,136,328
5.0,2/7/2018,"We were a bit skeptical on making reservations for dinner while in town because of the reviews. I'm glad we did!! Everything was perfect. My table side Cosmopolitan, appetizers and entrees were delish. The steak came back exactly the way we ordered it. A couple of things to order if you're not afraid of a few carbs while visiting NYC are the macaroni n cheese, garlic bread and asparagus. All super tasteful and perfectly cooked. Although the reviews on the service were a bit negative, I thought the waiter we had was fantastic! He was attentive to our every need. He was easy to speak to and was willingly answering all of our questions and concerns. I'm glad we read through reviews and noticed reviews were based on service not on the quality of food, otherwise, we would've missed out on great food and a very pleasant ambiance....Dinner inside The Grand Central Station!

4.0,2/6/2018,"My friend and I came here after stopping at The Campbell Apt. Since my friend had to wait for her train we decided to wait at the bar instead. She said she would order from her favorite bartender and I'm sure the bartender remembers her well since he sees millions of people daily. The bartender's name is Joseph so she called Joseph and started ordering. Of course I've eaten at this steakhouse before (before the review-era). I thought it was very good. The noise from people at the Grand Central could be heard in the background. I made a stop at a dining host counter on the way back from the restroom when the steak bones caught my eyes. They placed individual wrapped bones by the host counter. I thought about Sandy the dog but we knew very well not to give her the bones (never!). Eddie the host let me have one for Sandy, that's nice! The bone was big so we only let Sandy lick on it! Anyway, my friend ordered a porterhouse and some fries. I tried a piece of the steak. Same taste, very good. Juicy but buttery. I tried a little bit of the fries just for a taste. The fries was so so. Of course the location puts the price high, something I don't have to mention. You already know. Enjoy the view of Grand Central from here.",0,0,0,Nora F.,"Sunnyside, NY",84,678,5359
5.0,2/2/2018,"I had an absolutely lovely time dining at Michael Jordan's. From the food, to the atmosphere, to the waitstaff, everything was great! The restaurant is located inside Grand Central Terminal. Sounds a bit odd, but it's absolutely beautiful. You are elevated above the terminal and the tables overlook all of the action. It is actually quite romantic. Also, all of the waitstaff was professional and friendly!My boyfriend wanted to treat me to dinner and I suggested we try a NYC Restaurant Week deal. We came and ate a 3 course dinner for $42 a person! I chose the oysters Vanderbilt for my starter - I loved their spin on making a rich and creamy oyster. My boyfriend chose the tomato bisque. We both got the strip steak for our entrée - cooked perfectly! For dessert, we tried the cheesesteak and apple crumb cake with cinnamon ice cream. I definitely suggest the apple crumb cake!",3,1,2,Laurel F.,"New York, NY",360,272,596
3.0,2/1/2018,"Long day of drinking this was an easy option to try on the way home. Main dish I went with the Shrimp scampi not what I expected? Didn't read the menu properly shrimp scampi in most places is served with pasta or rice here it was served w green beans ... ahh disappointed yes only because I wanted pasta but overall not terrible they give u a nice amount of shrimp perfectly grilled & the green beans were not bad nice garlic flavor. My friends had the Burger w fries good with or w out cheese, fries good as well.Stopped by on a different occasion since I've been wanting to give the giant fries a try, my friend & I stopped by after work one day we sat at the bar. Drinks we tried the MJ Metropolitan cocktail this was very good nice taste, ok amount of alcohol.The giant fries u get 3 plus 3 sauces, mayo base, truffle & BBQ. Decent sauces I liked the truffle one the best as for the fries ... nothing special not really sure what I was expecting? Taste wise the sauces is what makes the difference the fries themselves taste exactly as it should like a ""fry"" having to have tried the regular fries before to me those were better & not as filling as the big ones. Restaurant wise nice set up considering this is located inside GC, bar & seating area upfront plus a lot more room towards the back. Service is good, price wise normal to the area but pricey in my opinion, cocktails are pricey at $15 for a small martini they do not seem to have any happy hour specials which kinda sucks.",10,2,5,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",546,1069,6718
2.0,1/26/2018,"Let's start with I waited 15 minutes to get a beer at the bar. No one should ever wait that long and the server is the one who asked me if I needed something not the bartender. Next, there is some guy who is now blasting music from his iPhone like he is a DJ or something. Third, food: No, forget it. Not worth the price tag.The view is great and I say sit at one of the cocktail tables where you can log in, better service there and a calmer vibe. They had a recent fire so the kitchen was closed, call to see if they are serving food. I think this actually may help them work out the food somewhat.

1.0,1/21/2018,"Went to the bar which overlooks the waiting room of Grand Central, Beautiful setting. We ordered two proseccos. I don't mind paying $16 a drink but this bar is in need of some serious renovation. The once attractive bar is water stained and gouged and there is a whole section of the bar top where the finish is completely gone - bare wood! Can't be hygienic, right? Over the bar a section of gold cladding was askew! It's okay to charge a lot for a drink but this bar is beginning to look like a dive bar without any of the vibe of a good dive bar.",1,0,0,Jim B.,"New Canaan, CT",0,9,0
4.0,1/19/2018,The customer service at this location is great. I ordered the Mac and cheese and a classic burger and I must say it was the best Mac and cheese I've had so far and one of the very burgers as well. My friend ordered the filet mignon and it had a very burnt taste to it but the friendly waiter offered to switch her dish and remove the steak from the bill. They also offer to provide you with faster service if you have a train to catch so that's a huge plus!

5.0,12/28/2017,"Absolutely love it here! This place feels like a DESTINATION and earns that title by serving up delicious food, great service, an unbeatable view of Grand Central and a classy, elegant vibe. They have a lot to offer up on their menu including a Whole Fried Cheese Loaded Baked Potato that is straight up bonkers delicious along with drool-worthy Mac 'n Cheese and a 23 Layer Cake that'll definitely have you fighting over who gets the last bite if you make the silly mistake of trying to share a piece. But even with all that nothing beats their Prime NY Strip Steak - absolutely INSANE! I had mine prepared medium rare (because, duh) and every bite was as tasty as the last.

We paid $16 for guacamole. I asked if it was prepared fresh table side and the waiter said yes....only for it to come out premade. I will say it tasted fresh but again, not worth the cost. It was maybe max 2 avocados. I also ordered a glass of wine and it came in this mini/skinny glass. I overheard a lady at another table ask for an ""adult sized"" glass and I have to agree with her.

He was so unprofessional and caused a scene that made me sick and I left. I felt awful for the poor girl- she was practically yelled out of the place. Very uncouth and unexpected at such an upscale place- shame on him and whoever allowed this to happen.

3.0,11/15/2017,"Michael Jordan Steak House offers excellent views of Grand Centrla but only ok food that is probably on the almost not worth it end of its price point. The cake was pretty dang good. As others have harped, the service is a bit slow, even though the restaurant was only a third full. Multiple waiters and staff were consistently standing around with an air of confusion. I ordered a burger, which came on a standard bun. The add ons, including the lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles were all mediocre. Luckily, the star of the show, the burger patty, was a large chunk of meat and cooked with a good crust and a juicy bite. The fries were huge and pretty delicious. Unfortunately, the whole thing was pretty expensive, clocking in at around 26 dollars. My girlfriend got the ahi tuna, which was a large portion, similarly expensive, and was decent.The star of the show was the 23 layer cake. It was amazingly moist and has lasted 3+ meals in the form of leftovers. Overall, the affair is pretty expensive, but decent.

4.0,10/23/2017,"Was very excited to take my fiancée here for her birthday because MJ is her favorite player. Upon arrival we were told the dining room was closed and we can sit at the bar. The bartender was nice but short with her responses to our questions. As she was putting our drink coasters on the bar she flicked one so hard it seem like she was throwing it at me and caused me to get startled. I let that slide after she recommended a great tequila for our margaritas. The bill at the bar $45 for 2 drinks plus tip. They were good but geez! We get to our table and it wasn't anything spectacular. The seating was pretty low so we didn't have a great view of the terminal unless we stood and looked over. Our food was good but very basic. The 2 tables next to ours each at an issue with their food and had to send it back. So we were hoping that wouldn't happen to us and luckily it didn't. The biggest disappointment was when we tried to order the famous 23 layer chocolate cake... they were sold out.. at 5pm during the dinner crowd on a Sunday..we have to go back just for the cake. I was also expecting to see some MJ memoriblia posters, signage nothing... The wait staff was nice our waiter was great and the hostess was great as well.

4.0,9/28/2017,"First and foremost, the setting - how can you beat the view? One glance and you have a gorgeous perspective of Grand Central Station ... not to mention an ample place for prime people-watching. But to be fair, you'll be focusing more on the food rather than the people. The menu is classic and concise. My friend and I made friends with our waiter (who TBH was a gem and all-around awesome guy) who made us feel right at home. We ordered a few appetizers including the shrimp, wedge salad and their well-known bacon. I was impressed by the appetizers but was definitely not prepared for the dinner + dessert. We ordered the Porterhouse for Two which was definitely eye-catching. They presented it beautifully and paired it with truffle creamed spinach (heck yes), shoestring onions and an off-the-menu loaded cheesy baked potato (don't ask questions, just order this). It was all wonderful. Everything had flavor, was seasoned right and cooked perfectly. At this point we (as well as you probably are) thinking how can you eat anything beyond that??? Well my friend, I have 1 answer with 23 layers on it. Their 23 layer chocolate cake is decadence at its finest. I would recommend leaving room specifically for this alone.

2.0,8/15/2017,"Meh.  Brought my team here for lunch today for an outing, and I wasn't very impressed.  I've been to the MJ's @ Mohegan Sun in CT, and had an AMAZING experience there, however this time the experience was not great.  2 of us ordered restaurant week, and 2 ordered regular lunch items.  Once our waiter figured out we weren't having a huge expensive business lunch (i.e. loads of apps and cocktails), I found him to be rather cold and a sort of rude demeanor towards us.  He also forgot the 1 app we did order (the cheesy garlic bread).  For restaurant week, I had the gazpacho, strip steak, and sorbet.  The gazpacho that was described to have shrimp in it had 1 (my coworker only had 1 as well), and had a strange tangy flavor -- I couldn't finish it.  I ordered my steak medium rare, it came out more on the medium well side and was hard and chewy.  The only good thing on the plate was the garlic creamy mashed potatoes.  The sorbet was good, standard dessert, nothing amazing.Won't be bringing my team back here for lunch or happy hour for that matter as there are many better delicious (and friendlier) options in Midtown NYC.  Maybe the food and service is better when its not restaurant week?  It's too bad as my team and whole office goes out often for lunch and happy hours, and this is literally across the street from our office.",1,0,0,Allison R.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,37,17

1.0,8/4/2017,"I was so excited to try this restaurant. We collected a bunch of family members and went this past Wednesday for dinner. Maybe it was because it was restaurant week...We were a party of eight arriving for a 7 PM reservation on time. We were seated promptly but it took 10minutes before our drink order was taken. Then, we had to remind them twice before they brought us our menus. From there it went down hill-It was a full hour before appetizers arrived. We ordered both from the dinner as well as restaurant week menu. To add insult, the maitre D. came by to ask how we were enjoying the evening. You cannot see that we had nothing on the table to eat? Needless to say, we asked if our order could be sped up. Eventually, the food came. Appetizers were fair but Entrees were horrible. The rib eye on the restaurant week menu came out a paillard thin slice with Gorgonzola cheese on top. Seriously? You are that cheap that you have to serve a paper thin steak? Sliced steak was flavorless. Even the standard medium burger arrived rare. You are at a steak house and can't get meat temperature down?  We will never go back. After eating at countless restaurants in NYC, my only recommendation is to choose another restaurant.

We got there at 9:25 for some drinks and food. But main restaurant closes at 9:30 but open until 10 for bar food. So opted for drinks and bar menu. I got a burger and he got wings. Food was good. Simple burger with cheese and sautéed onions. No sauce. You actually didn't need it because meat was really juicy. His wings were like fried chicken wings, super crispy and two sauces on the side.  Both great choices for bar fare. Drinks were really good, didn't skimp on alcohol. However the service was horrible. I don't like to be mean when it comes to service. I get it. It's hard work for little pay and you deal with crazy people all day. But when you also work for tips it pays to be nice sand friendly.  We had to ask for water. He brought one for my husband and not me. We had to ask again for my water. He also was huffing as we asked for water, sorry to inconvenience you buddy. He never came back to ask if we wanted another drink, and clearly mine was empty before I had even started my food.

3.0,4/18/2017,"The atmosphere overlooking the Grand Central atrium makes this a distinctive, fun place to meet -- and an especially convenient one during lunch or early dinner hours. The food is very good, albeit a notch below the top-level steakhouses in the City. The menu has solid, varied steakhouse fare. I have had the strip steak and the grilled tuna -- both were very tasty. Service is friendly and efficient. Food tends to come out in a fairly speedy fashion, but there is not pressure to hustle out the door once entrees are taken away. Overall, not a super premium NYC steakhouse gem, but still a good place for a semi upscale treat for lunch or an early dinner before heading home on Metro North or the subway. Also good for visitors who will appreciate the Grand Central scene. The restaurant can get busy, but tables are usually available fairly easily -- with the exception being tables right next to the railing looking directly into the Grand Central atrium. If you want the full experience, you should try to call ahead and make sure that you can sit at one of those tables. The interior decor is classy albeit more plain -- you'll still be able to see and appreciate the location but it's not the same as sitting on the coveted outer ring of tables.

I advised the hostess that I was going to sit with her yet it was almost 10 minutes before the first person approached us. He mumbled when he asked if we wanted water. My friend requested wine. He said ,""I don't do wine. I do water."" Ok. We took water. We asked if the restaurant had menus. ""Yeah"" Can we have 2 please? "" Oh, I'll let your waiter know"". We waited. We waited. Enough. We got up and left. We told the hostess we were leaving and she said goodbye. My question really was whether anyone worked there? That was ridiculous! Has anyone been trained to work in the restaurant business? Have any of them an ounce of sense? Not worth the trouble for anyone to go here.

2.0,3/5/2017,"Nice atmosphere having dinner in Grand Central. Was not noisy at all considering the location. Ordered strip steak medium well , which came our very undercooked. Had to have a busboy grab our waiter to cook more. Unfortunately this left me snacking on our side dishes for about 10 minutes while the steak cooked. The waiter was apologetic , but no gesture for fresh sides or even to comp my cup of coffee or desert at the end. I've been to  steak houses such as Del Friscos where the have you cut into your steak as the Servers stand by so it can be corrected quickly if undercooked and fresh sides provided so your meal is complete. Also disappointed by a lack of steak sauces. I'm an A1 guy but often have had restaurant prepared steak sauces that hit the spot. Was proved with peppercorn and a bearnaise sauce. Wasn't thrilled with either but my wife liked the peppercorn. My wife had the filet which was cooked fine, sides of mac and cheese and mashed potato were fine as well. I noticed the manager lingering about but he did not stop at any tables to check in, there were two large tables that he did speak with , but none others. So overall disappointed but willing to try again, everyone has an off night. Just won't be back too soon.  Eating at The Capital Grille next week and have always had a great meal there.

4.0,3/4/2017,"I decided to take my dad here to celebrate his birthday. Originally, I had a lunch reservation but that turned into dinner because we were a little late. We sat in the lunch area of the restaurant though I wanted to sit in the reserved area. They started us with your usual bread and butter which was pretty okay,(choose from a raisin-rye and a garlic poppyseed). We ordered crab cakes, guacamole and the garlic bread for starters. The presentation was nice. I liked the stacking of the garlic bread on a bed of Gorgonzola fondue. The crab cakes were succulent and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of crisp. Also enjoyed the guacamole with tortilla chips. For entree, I had the branzino with grape tomatoes and capers. This was very tasty, grilled and seasoned well. If I had to choose between regular sea bass and branzino (Greek sea bass), I would go with regular. Obviously they are similar in texture but I feel regular sea bass is a bit heartier and meatier. The sauce was great!! Others in my party had salmon, and burgers which they all said were good. The macaroni and cheese was  Deee-LISH!!!! I'm not sure what medley of cheeses were used but it was super creamy and so chocked full of cheese goodness!! Yum! For desserts, we had the banana tart and salted caramel cheeesecake. See pictures! They were definitely as yummy as they looked.Overall I'd give this place 4 stars. I'd definitely dine here again but next time in the dinner area. Servers were attentive and took directions well, I wouldn't mind if they had offered more bread though! We ended the night with a bday song and were out.

2.0,1/23/2017,"Michael Jordan, widely seen as the greatest of all time in basketball and this excellence has rubbed off on steaks as well. Primely located in Grand Central Terminal, the steakhouse makes the most of its location, giving unparalleled views, which makes it great to watch people coming and going from the trains. We've come here a few times before and ordered the bone-in rib eye, which is a juicy and well cooked delight. The steak comes a bit charred on the outside, but cooked to spec on the inside - always a bit redder than you think it would be, but that's expected in most steak houses.  Unfortunately, this excellence doesn't transcend to service, speed, or Desert. The overall service was slow, as even though there were only a few tables in the back, the waiter was nowhere to be seen during the meal, often having to be flagged down. After being seated, it took a good ten minutes for our menus to be brought to our tables and even longer for bread to be brought to the table (which the restaurant has gotten much stingier on - only bringing one piece per person, as opposed to when they used to bring a whole plate for the table). After we place our order, we continued to wait for what seemed like an eternity for our food to come out, despite the minimal amount of people eating at the time. The steaks were delicious as they should be for the price, however when we ordered desert, what should have ended our meal on a sweet note did not. After getting about halfway through the Chocolate Brownie, I tasted something plastic in my mouth. There was a plastic wrapper inside the brownie, which ruined the desert. The only thing that saved this from getting 1 star was the managers removal of the desert from the bill",0,0,0,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",209,259,1991

I ordered a medium rare Filet Mignon and received something that I would call just south of medium.  Of course my wife received a very rare piece of meat, what she asked for was medium.  It was very obviously my order but it was so rare, almost raw that I would have sent it back.  The delivery to our table, for a party of 6 was chaotic at best with more than one mistake. At the end of dinner when I asked if it was possible to get hot fudge sauce on my ice cream, a brownie sundae was an option but I went with ice cream, the look I got back was the same as if I was asking for our meal to be free.

Given the fact that you are paying $13 for a small bowl).* Sara had a spinach salad (I don't know how much she enjoyed it...?) and I had some kind of a meat sandwich. The meat was super tough (rubbery), dry, & had a lot of fat on it. Had to cut off most of it out, after which, there was nothing left to eat, I had to return my plate/dish back.* Instead of that, I order a tuna tartare for $28 and the kitchen managed to fail in that department as well. Instead of searing my tuna lightly, they have scorched my dish (tuna, that is). They've decided to use the sesame seeds on the tuna (which wasn't a bad idea) and they've cooked it so much that my tuna tasted burned log on my plate.

On a scale of 1 - 10, with 10 being the best:Ambience:  5 - nice views of Grand Central.  tables were nicely spaced, not crammed together.Service:  1  - our waiter seemed completely confused throughout our entire meal.   Our salads came out about 10 minutes after we sat down which is fine.  However, our entrée was served 40 minutes later (unacceptable) - we were offered no additional bread either while we waited.   I also saw a table come after us get served their entrees before we got ours.  We only have an hour for lunch and our lunch ended up taking 1 hour 45 minutes.  Also, I believe our waiter could not figure out how to use the credit card machine.  As we sat waiting to get the receipt to sign, I can see him running back and forth waiting on other tables while holding our check then wringing his hands while he was trying to use the credit card machine!!!   Service was truly awful.Food - 5 - my friend's medium-well filet medallions came out medium rare.  My medium-rare filet medallions came out rare.  We did not bother to send this back to the kitchen since were running out of time.  We were afraid it would take them another 30 minutes to cook the meat a little more.Disappointing as we were so looking forward to this lunch.",1,2,1,Lisa T.,"Flushing, NY",6,75,24
3.0,7/25/2016,"Michael Jordan's overall score: 78My wife and I grabbed a quick lunch here for NYC restaurant week, summer 2016. The menu was pretty good for three courses at $29. Here were the selections:Flavor: 7I went with the strip steak for $10 additional.It had a nice peppery crust, but was missing something in the flavor department. I'd guess this was likely a prime cut, or at the very least high choice, but definitely not aged. It was cooked nicely to medium rare from end to end, and it was juicy as well.The corn salsa that came with it was a bit too heavily dressed with red wine vinegar or something. I wasn't a fan.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 8They offer all four main cuts here. They also offer several selections with a bone, and without a bone. It would be good to see some aged selections, but they at least have some large format items. All of the beef is either prime or high choice, as far as I can tell.Portion Size & Plating: 8Portions are good here. My steak was probably around the 14oz mark, boneless. So this is a good amount of food for the money. Plating is basic, with a touch of elegance. Not too much, though, as the tables are all covered in white paper. It's not overboard.Price: 8We did the restaurant week lunch special, which I thought was a good deal. However, the regular prices here are pretty fair as well. If the cuts served on the standard menu are superior, this might have a better score, as everything is under $50 per person, per cut.Bar: 8The bar seemed to be split away from the dining area. As this joint is situated in Grand Central, they are constrained by where they can set up and what they can do. But since this spot is across from Cipriani Dolci, it is definitely a nice place to drink.Specials and Other Meats: 7Chicken and veal are your only non-beef, non-fish options here, as far as I can tell. Our waiter didn't read any special cuts for us.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 7We were limited here for what we could try on the restaurant week menu, but here's a breakdown of what we had:Caesar Salad: Nothing too amazing, and nothing bad. There was a generous amount of shredded cheese on this, which I liked.Tomato & Mozzarella Salad: A bit skimpy on the mozzarella, but the balsamic on the tomatoes was excellent. I liked the addition of cucumbers to this salad, and the onions weren't too potent.Cheesecake: Unfortunately, the strawberry shortcake listed on the menu above was replaced with cheesecake. However, the cheesecake wasn't bad at all. It was creamy, without being overly sweet. It had a pop of lemon brightness to it as well.Raspberry Sorbet: This was tasty and tart. I actually enjoyed it better when combined with a sliver of the cheesecake.Seafood Selection: 7There's branzino, lobster, tuna, salmon and swordfish here. That's a good showing. My wife picked the salmon from the restaurant week menu. She ordered it medium, but it came back more like medium well. It had a nice char-grilled flavor to it, but it was otherwise a bit dry. The flavor was nice, it just needed some moisture.Service: 8Our waiter spoke pretty fast and it was tough to hear him at times, but luckily it was formality kind of speak that we were missing out on. Waters were filled up often, and service wasn't slow or poor in any way. The table breads were nice little miniature loaves that were warm, and went nicely with the flake salt and butter.Ambiance: 10Dining while overlooking the hustle and bustle of Grand Central is definitely an amazing experience. You'd be hard-pressed to find a place in NYC with a better view that is so readily accessible to people of all means, whether you're out for a nice steak meal for a special occasion, or power-lunching with the bankers of midtown.",4,1,1,JohnnyPrimeC.

1.0,5/30/2016,"I can't speak for the food because I didn't have a chance to eat; I left after two beers and horrible service.  One of the bartenders was nice.  He said he was a new employee, but acted like an experienced professional in the service industry.  I'm talking about the guy who was middle-aged and looks like Kramer from Seinfeld and Pee Wee Herman somehow had a baby together.  This guy refused to serve me local beers, and when I asked why, he said ""why is that so hard to understand"".  He then called me ""difficult"" several times.  I finally gave in, and ordered the beer he would let me order.  I didn't want to leave a tip, because Pee Wee Kramer was the biggest jerk that's ever served me, but I wanted to make sure the other bartender who was nice got a tip.  If you go to this restaurant, stick to tap water so you don't have to deal with the jerk bartender.",0,1,0,Taylor L.,"McKinney, TX",0,26,0

Which means that sometimes I have some time to kill before my next train. Which means it's time for a drink. This bar is really the main bar in Grand Central. I've gone there a few times for a drink before heading home. It's nice enough. The bartenders are nice. The people drinking there seem nice. The prices are OK for NYC. But there's nothing special about it. I get that it's named after Michael Jordan the basketball Hall of Famer, and I'm not expecting that his steakhouse has to have a sports bar atmosphere. But this place is so non descript, it could be named John Doe and no one would know the difference. So, if you want a drink in Grand Central, it's a nice place to have one.

5.0,4/26/2016,"Michael Jordan the basketball player doesn't even match up to this restaurant! Okay.. Maybe I got a little ahead of myself hahaLet me start with telling you this restaurant is in the prime location of where many (understatement) tourist as well as locals pass through on a daily to make their rounds to wherever their destination is. This restaurant is in the grand central station (on the 2nd floor) where subways, trains, and people all run non stop. This is the city the never sleeps! So me and 2 of my friends walk up to the hostess  without a reservation and with a request of a private section because we were so tired from the flight that we just wanted peace and quiet along with a great meal. The hostess said that would be difficult to accommodate but told us to wait a minute while she called over the manager. The manager arrived and was more than understanding of our situation. We all had luggage on us and he said that wouldn't be a problem and first directed us to where we could store our luggage while we sat down and ate. I think the managers name was Rodney, and he was absolutely a person you'd like to contact if you're having any type of situation at the restaurant. For some reason he personally provided his services to us. Took us to drop off our luggage and told us to a wait a few minutes while they got our table ready and took us to the table itself when ready. They accommodated all of our request without any resistance and I call that 5 star service. As far as the food, we arrived when there was a set brunch menu even though we could've ordered anything else off the menu I ordered the rib eye steak and eggs. The steak was amazing!!! Cut like butter! I had high expectations for this restaurant because if a restaurant is in the middle of a prime location where many people pass I would expect them to hold themselves to high standards due to all the possible customers they might have. And man did they live up to my expectations! I could really go on about this restaurant and its service and food but I hope y'all get the point. Food is 5 stars and service is 5 stars. For such a busy place this restaurant is as even keel as could be and will provide you with a great experience especially if you just came off a flight and caught a subway to it haha.

2.0,2/6/2016,"My coworkers came in last night for the last day of restaurant week for one of my coworkers birthday. We work really close to the restaurant and it was a quick walk over. Upon arriving a few minutes late to a 5 pm reservation, we were seated. Our waiter came by and gave us a wine list and asked if we preferred tap or sparkling and we chose tap. We had wine since they didn't have any other options.Before the waiter came back, we were offered dinner rolls which were very regular and difficult to cut. The butter was not salted but there was a small dish of salt for the table. Seems very unsanitary. Anyways, three of us opted for the restaurant week menu and the fourth decided to order off the regular menu.1. Crab cake & petit steak & pecan ice cream sundae 2. Crab cake & salmon & cheesecake3. Caesar salad & petit steak & cheesecake 4. Regular menu: butter lettuce salad sans cheese and shrimp Every thing was simply underwhelming. The crab cake was okay. Slight sear on the outside but extremely over mixed with other ingredients and the salads looked sad.The steak had a great sear with a great crust but still a little chewy. The salmon was overdone. And the shrimp... There was four shrimp on a plate of red sauce. Very disappointing to say the least. As for dessert, the ice cream was good and the cheesecake very standard.Before we could ask for the check, the waiter had already brought it to the table. He repeatedly shuffled his feet around us and made it very uncomfortable.

2.0,2/3/2016,"Let me start by saying that I came during restaurant week for the 3 course menu for $38. Restaurant week is when I can try these steak houses that I cannot normally afford. I own a couple of Michael Jordan sneakers so I figured let me try his restaurant even though there is no correlation between the two.I thought the location, in Grand Central, was ideal because I was leaving an event in the area but I was not impressed by the restaurant being in the balcony of the station. It was very noisy with all of the people in the downstairs area commuting. I also thought there would be some Michael Jordan paraphernalia and décor around the restaurant but there wasn't.The food was very good, although the portions were a little small in my estimation. I'm not sure why these ""4"" and ""5"" star restaurants have such small portions, but it could have just been the restaurant week menu. I ordered the Petit Strip and it was certainly petite. It was seasoned and cooked to perfection, just a lil small for a strip I felt. The side potato was about the size of a plum, unacceptable. My date enjoyed her dish of broiled Salmon with asparagus. We ordered the garlic bread and cheese fondue, which was good but the cheese wasn't all that warm, or flowing from a fountain lol.The service was impeccable as all the wait staff was very attentive. I would like to go back when I can afford the regular menu and see if things change but with a $97 Porterhouse (for 2) being on the menu, I'm not sure when that will be. I wouldn't recommend this place to friends because I think there are other options that can give you more bang for your buck, even during restaurant week.  In the end the restaurant has some nice qualities but it's overpriced and there are other, better, options out there.

That garlic bread fondue.. to die for! Crab cakes were the best I've ever had anywhere.  We both had steak. The only issue with that is, similar to a review someone else stated. And that was the cracked black pepper on top, it was wayyyy too much pepper and being coarse made it unpleasurable. So I scraped it off.

3.0,1/31/2016,"As pretty as this place is, the food honestly doesn't meet up to the expectations. Service was okay, the waiters were very friendly which was a plus. But the wait time for food is way too long. We got our appetizers relatively quick after we ordered (crab cake and soup). The soup had a layer of oil on top, and honestly comparable to something you poured out of a can. The crab cakes, however, had big chunks of crab meat and was flavorful. Then to the steak part, after we got our appetizers, it took 37 minutes for us to get our steak (I took a picture of the appetizers to send to my friend so we knew the exact time). We both ordered our steaks medium, which honestly shouldn't take almost 40 minutes to cook. When the steak came, my filet mignon was cooked nicely, a nice medium, with a crust on the side, but it was very very bland. Could've used some salt or any seasoning. My friend's steak was way too raw for a medium, possibly a medium rare or barely cooked. When you press it down with a fork, blood was still coming out. The outside was very very cooked, almost burnt, but the inside ironically was very raw. Not sure how you can over cook the edges but the inside stays raw. We had to send it back to be cooked a bit more, it was just way too raw for our preference. It took us a bit to flag down a waiter because no one checked up on how we were doing. For dessert, we had the cheesecake, which was quite stiff. It tasted like it's been in the fridge for a bit and it dried out. Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again. The ice cream was just regular ice cream, nothing more special than boxed ice cream from the supermarket. Their menu online was outdated, they have a new cocktail menu if you ask for it. I ordered a drink that was a twist on the Fuzzy Navel because I love the taste of peach. It wasn't strong enough for me, and could've also used a bit more sweetener. Tasted like a watered down cocktail. All in all, food was okay, but I wouldn't come back a second time.

3.0,1/22/2016,"Came here for the three-course restaurant week lunch - I know, I should not expect the best dining experience. But there were still some basic things they messed up.Pros:Made a reservation for 8 people at 2pm on a Wednesday, they accommodated us easily. Only 6 of us showed up, and they are supposed to charge an automatic 20% gratuity for parties of 7 or more, but they didn't. Really appreciated that.The pear salad and cheesecake were delicious.The ambiance is beautiful, looking over the terminal.Our waitress was nice, though not that attentive.Cons:There was almost no one in the restaurant yet they could not get our orders right. In fact, near the end of our stay I don't think there were any other patrons in the dining room. They made one steak well done when it was asked to be medium well - luckily, the woman whose order it was was unfussy, but I would've certainly sent it back. Also, every single plate we ordered was served to the wrong person - the exception being for dessert, because we all ordered the cheesecake. Not a big deal, but as I mentioned before, only 6 of us showed up at the table of 8 so both heads of the table were empty, and at one point a server put a steak in front of one of the empty place settings and confidently said, ""This goes here."" ????????? You could give him the benefit of the doubt and say maybe he thought it was to go to one of the people on either side of the empty place settings, but they had already gotten their food.I use the term 'steak' there ^ quite loosely. The restaurant week lunch steak option is four slices of steak. We all left hungry. I think it was good but I can't quite recall because of the small sample size. They were even extremely skimpy with the side of potato.Final verdict: I'm glad I can say I tried it but I will not be going back.

It was a busy day so it was our only meal of the day and as we wanted to try out the grilled chicken salad and the salmon starter we ordered one of each and shared our meal, both eating from the same plates. Within 30 minutes we starters feeling really really sick so we started heading home.We didn't make it home. My friend started first, at Delaney station she was violently ill on the j platform. We got on the subway but had get off after a few stops as I now stared to feel ill. We were both violently sick outside, so I'll we decided to head to our nearest ER as by now we were not puking food anymore. We called the restaurant back to inform them of what had happened. They took our details and said they would call us back. An hour later we were called back by a rude manager who didn't ask of our condition but asked us where we were and then said she would call us back. That's was over 24hrs ago. Since then we have not been called back or written to. Please please please whatever you do do not order any salmon or fresh salad from this place. You will come down with the worst food poisoning ever, they will charge you almost $80 for it and they won't care when you're sick or try to rectify the situation. If there is an avenue we can peruse with the nyc department of health we will as I'm sure there are other people who have been poisoned at this establishment.

Ours showed up with 4 meager slices of meat dwarfed by steamed broccoli (which was actually supposed to be steak fries). To MJ's credit, they kindly took it back and let us reorder. It was then replaced with a thin, over cooked version of the real thing ($42). I've never ordered a ribeye at a ""steakhouse"" or otherwise this lame. Fries were good, but if you can't make a good fry you shouldn't be in the business. Either way, a smallish order of plain fries without truffle oil or Parmesan shouldn't cost $9.

""Sure."" Oops). Though you might think a burger special would come with fries, it doesn't. I did get soda, however, and was gullible enough to assume that because it cost $4 it would come with a refill. When I asked for a refill, the bartender just filled it without mentioning the charge. I think the fact that a refill is $4 is material and should be disclosed. So I paid $18 two small sodas and an ok burger. It takes a lot of gall to charge $4 for a small soda with no refills and not mention that fact.I understand the steakhouse deal in which you pay for expensive sides to share - but if you are offering a $10 burger special, why not make the offer manageable and offer accompaniments for a similarly reasonable price.

I asked for swiss instead of the processed cheese, and that is a no go: apparently it costs too much to satisfy the customer. Not a 'regular' steak house bar: a bit cheap on the pour and never a buyback. I prefer the old standards. So I recommend the Bar for it's brilliant location, people watching, view of Grand Central. But I would say it's better as a 'one and done' spot, however long you may take, rather than a place to hang and drink.   As for the steak, it's ok and the best for several blocks (though Benjamin's has better meat, cooked to order), but it's not brilliant or a big cut.

However, the service was a disaster, except from the lady at entrance, nobody took care of us during the 10 first minutes. Then we got the menus, and the NYC restaurant week specific menu was only left on the table without any explanation. After that, the guy came back almost half an hour later to take our order, still without a smile. I think because of our very strong French accent, he thought we were tourists and was pretty unfriendly. The water boy wasn't really efficient neither: I had to ask several times to get my glass refilled and after two slices of bread, they decided we had enough and refuse to serve us more.The silliest part of this was that the check came with the tip included (almost 20%, which, I think, was further overestimated regarding the customer experience we had there).Putting this apart, I have to admit that being seated in Grand Central station is absolutely amazing and the food was great too.

The shrimp was super fresh and the crabcakes were really, really good. For dinner, our large group had a little bit of everything. Several of us had the bone-in rib eye. By far, the best steak any one of us has ever eaten. And we have eaten many a steak. It required no sauce at all. It was tender and juicy. And, it was perfectly cooked. One person had the salmon which was okay. Another person had the lobster, which we all wanted more of. And another person had the filet, which was also very good. For sides, we enjoyed sauteed brocolli, macaroni and cheese, steak fries and sweet potatoe fries. Each side tried to outdo the other side. All were very, very good. I have a hard time choosing a favorite one.The only downside to our meal was the server. He was dismissive, and apparently has not yet fully developed his listening and executing skills. He also disappeared for long periods of time, and was not fully engaged with our party.

The meat was dry, the vegatables weren't edible along with being extremely salty. Lastly, I had the strawberry shortcake, it was horrible as well. All the portions were small.

2.0,7/27/2014,"This sorry excuse for a commercial establishment is saved by only two things - and they aren't the kind of things that a native New Yorker, or a true ""foodie,"" would ever care about... But I do, I care. There are a slew of miserable, freakish regulars and not-immediately-obvious prostitutes, and the view is lovely. Now you're wondering why prostitutes and borderline personality disorder-afflicted patrons are a plus for me? Let's just say: they both have some great stories, and I make documentaries, sometimes for fun. So this place is a GOLD MINE. Oh, you want to actually eat food? GO ANYWHERE, I mean ANYWHERE else. I have lived 36 years on this earth and have eaten meals in 48 of the 50 states, and I can confidently, and without hesitation say that these were the worst chicken wings I have EVER had. In fact, the most repulsive chicken dish i have ever made the mistake of consuming. But when you watch not-even-remotely-attractive prostitutes work their magic on mostly-unsuspecting travelers and passers-by, one (well, me anyway) forgets about the horrifying food and is entranced by watching them work their magic. Or whatever it's called... Fantastic. I'm actually sitting here typing this review while ""Genevieve"" is telling her 73 year old ""date"" she is ""from my Motha, but technically I growed up in Queens."" God I love this place. Back to the food - the drinks are the most over-priced, under-saturated sorry excuses for beverages in this entire city. The food; well the chicken was like almost-moist sand in my mouth that tasted worse than I imagine moist sand would taste. The one salad I tried reminded me of a misguided attempt at the salad bar in a small town grocery store, whose produce delivery was a week behind. The beer alone was $9. Unless you're looking for a carnival of freaks to get character ideas for a novel, or you're looking for a good time with a not-so-good lady, there is no earthly reason for you to waste time or money here.

Dessert was my favorite - it was a slice of roasted pineapple with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The pineapple with nice and sweet and being that ice cream is my favorite dessert I was in seventh heaven.  The only thing is that the waiter should have given us knives to cut the pineapple cause it was a little hard to do so with a spoon.Overall, it was a good lunch for the price.  I would definitely recommend it for Restaurant Week.",0,0,0,Kim O.,"Yonkers, NY",67,190,2

The Rib eye was cooked well with  a touch to much pepper, but the fat content was beyond a joke even for a rib eye. If you look at my photos it was almost 50% fat content, and our server had no answer except it should be that way. The MJ burger had a well cooked patty but the bun could not hold it all together which made it very difficult to handle. The steak chips that came with the MJ were extremely overcooked and close to being burnt.The service was off the mark too with patchy timings and I had my wine glass removed with out an offer to pour another or even a word.

Their mac and cheese was ridiculously good. Crunchy on top, well seasoned and creamy.  Asparagus side was also good. Disappointing however was the filet mignon. Not well seasoned and needed a bit more salt. I wish they had a broader appetizer menu like most steak houses, eg bacon, sliders, calamari. I am sure the commuters huddling at the bar looking for a snack would have agreed. Would have given them a 3.5 and rounded up to 4 except for the mixed service.  Service was odd. Was with a pregnant friend and told him we wouldn't be interested in the seafood tower. He continued to pitch it, in great detail.   What was disturbing was another waiter cleaning off our table. He brushed bread crumbs and a couple of pieces of macaroni.

4.0,1/17/2014,I have recently been here two times and can tell you that their food is fabulous! I have tried their crispy half chicken breast and their mac and cheese. It may sound strange but the seven dollar mac and cheese is my favorite thing here. It is definitely a great comfort food and is the best mac and cheese I have ever tried. It is baked and so it is crispy on the top and soft and creamy in the inside. The chicken was really good as well with the herbs and the kale.

3.0,1/14/2014,I come to this restaurant mainly for the convenience of being in GCT. Easy to meet a client and catch a train back home. The food is generally good but not over the top. Other steakhouses in the area are better. This evening our server was not very good. Waiting excessively long to order and between courses. 90 minutes from table seating to main course arriving. As a result missed a train and then had to miss another due to slow aloof service. The bone in ribeye is competitively priced to bobby vans among others but just not the same.

I've never seen someone treat colleagues so horribly. It made us so uncomfortable. She yelled at the bartender who served us (who appeared to be working her butt off and not missing a beat), and she took it way more gracefully than I would have, because I'm sure she needs the job. Then the manager started in on another bartender until she burst into tears. She was really ruthless! A serious grinch trying to steal the Christmas spirit. When she took a break from yelling, she'd sit and play with her phone while everyone else worked. We told the other manager and he offered to buy us a round, but we had a train to catch.

This place is amazing for the view and pictures you get alone.We had a few different waiters, none of whom introduced themselves when they came over, so I have no idea who our actual waiter was.  At one point we gave one guy our drink order, and before they arrived, another guy came over and asked what we'd like to drink. It was confusing. Anyway, my husband and I both ordered a Filet Mignon ($38 each), which was steak alone. You had to order your sides separately - so we ordered a side of Mashed Potatoes (+$8), and a side of Broccoli (+$10). I know for a birthday dinner prices shouldn't matter, but $10.00 for broccoli?? seriously? I don't care if it's sauteed in gold next time, I wouldn't pay that again. We were served bread while we waited (pictured) and our food came around 15 minutes later (also pictured).  The Filet was absolutely delicious, one of the best steaks I've had. My husband agreed it was one of the best as well. The mashed potatoes were good too, I'd say worth the extra $$, but not the broccoli. After dinner we waited over 25 minutes for our waiter to come back to our table to ask about dessert. At one point my husband said he didn't want any dessert because it was taking too long to be acknowledged, but it was his birthday so I said to relax. We ordered the M&M ice cream sandwich (pictured) which was just bleh, not worth the wait. The cookies were dry and bland tasting, but the vanilla ice cream was good... Why three stars?*- We felt pressured from our waiter to order drinks (we dont drink alcohol, which we told him, yet he asked us several times) and to order the most expensive steaks. After my husband said he wanted the Filet Mignon the waiter said ""Are you sure you dont want the bone-in steak, its the best""... um, he said he wanted the filet, so... no. (minus one star). - They were aware it was my husbands 30th birthday (as I mentioned when making the reservation) but it was never acknowledged. Not even a candle in the dessert. disappointing.

That's probably the best part of eating here, especially now that the restaurant/bar that was on the other side of the terminal was turned into an Apple store - you have a great view of the entire terminal. I was here with a few people from work on a Monday night, which meant it wasn't terribly crowded - very easy to get a seat in the front part of the restaurant. Service is spotty, which is the main problem - the refill for drinks was a bit on the slow side. That said, it's more of a place to relax a little bit and take in the majesty of Grand Central, not to cram in a quick meal and hop...the food court on the lower level is good for that.As for the food itself - it costs a lot because you're in GC, and it has the MJ name, so when you pay $23 for the hamburger, it's not something totally unexpected. The burger was actually a decent size and pretty meaty, in a good way. The fries it comes with - not so much...you don't get many of them, and they're the big, thick kind that are just slices of potato thrown in the fryer. The mac and cheese, while not the kind I've had at a Westville or Blue Smoke, was pretty good - very cheesy, but with big macaroni noodles and a homey taste to it. It's pretty large as well, given it's an $8 side order. The drink selection is okay; they have a couple of local crafts brews on hand, but the majority is the standard big-label stuff.MJ's isn't going to be the best steakhouse you can find in NYC by any stretch, but it does have a setting that you're not going to get anywhere else. Combine it with food that's solid, if a tad pricey given location, and you have a solid overall dining experience.

We had bone-in ribeyes, which are the ultimate steakhouse meal. They were OK, but not as thick or flavorful as they used to be. They might still be prime, but just taste like good quality choice.They were cooked correctly, but the crust was a little too peppery. The knives were as dull as could be, making the steaks seem tough when they were not. Why would a restaurant not want you to have a sharp knife? Sides were pretty good. Mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery; creamed spinach was delicious; but the ""herbed mushrooms"" tasted like they came from a can. Service was OK, but the servers seemed very disinterested. It almost seemed like they were just working there while they were waiting to catch the 9:30 train to Yonkers. And when glasses on the table were empty, they were just taken away, with no offers or questions about refills. The restaurant is comfortable as far as spacing of tables but the only ambience comes from the station ceiling high above. For $70-75 per person, not including alcohol, Jordan's should be better than it is. It used to be. But at the rate it's slipping, it's in danger of being mistaken for an over-priced Sizzler.",1,0,0,Emerson T.,"Dallas, TX",0,36,0

4.0,4/23/2013,"4.5 stars.Alright, listen here: anyone who rags on this place isn't seeing the forrest for the trees. The steaks are fine (not spectacular, but more than acceptable for a steakhouse of it's level), the wine list extensive, yes, but that's not why you go to Michael Jordan's.You go there for the location.I've only gone once; my father and I were going to dine at the Oyster Bar, but it was closed for some reason, so we went upstairs and decided to try MJ's, which wound up being one of the happiest mishaps we ever experienced.Located right in Grand Central Station, this steakhouse may not have the fame or devotion tied to it that the Oyster Bar downstairs has, but it does have one huge advantage: the view. It's located right on one corner of the balcony which lines the entire plaza, which means you're in for a fantastic visual feast. It's easily one of the coolest places (physically) I've ever had dinner. If you go, make absolutely sure you're sat near the railing for the best possible view. Up or down- either way you look you're in for a treat.Outside of that, MJ's is everything you'd expect a Morton's-level steakhouse to be. I had the porterhouse, and enjoyed every morsel. They prepare their meat with lots of seasoning pre- and post-grilling, and I know that isn't for everybody but we both liked our cuts. They also have phenomenal fries- trust me, order some for your table to share.The bar is also solid: although it's not near the edge, just being on the outlying balcony affords you wonderful views.It's not the best steakhouse in Manhattan (not even close- but in this particular city that's not saying much), but it's well worth a visit over many others for the atmosphere alone.

3.0,4/18/2013,"What happens when the greatest basketball player of all-time grills a steak?I'm not sure. I'm fairly certain that Michael Jordan is not at the restaurant very often, and he almost definitely does not grill any of the steaks himself. Maybe at home he does, but that's just speculation, and it has little to do with this restaurant in Grand Central Terminal.My partner and I visited the restaurant for NYC's Restaurant Week. We were seated in a part of the restaurant that allowed us to easily view the Grand Concourse, and we enjoyed people-watching, especially the numerous close encounters between drunken Rangers fans and NY national guardsmen who are heavily armed yet have been scarcely trained to deal with civilian crowds. My, how safe we were.We both received the filet mignon. Not only did the filet have a great jumper, it was cooked to a perfect medium. It paired rather well with the red wine suggested by our waiter, and when teamed up with pippen au gratin, it was nearly unstoppable when charging the lane. On the other side of the ball, I was a bit disappointed, as I was able to easily slash through the chunk of beef with my knife. It was so soft defensively that I probably could have just used my fork. MJ's filet mignon won't be winning a Defensive Steak of the Year award any time soon, but I recommend it nonetheless.As for the three stars, perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, but the steakhouse charged a bit extra (above the regular restaurant week deal) for the filet and did not supply any deals regarding wine with the meal. Which is, of course, their right, but reviews don't simply exist in a vacuum. Yelp considers three stars as ""A-OK,"" which it invariably was; a perfectly satisfactory meal, but I would probably suggest visiting a good number of other NYC steakhouses before this one. Service-wise, we were well catered to, but I did lament at being forced to surrender my giant foam finger before dining.",1,2,0,Lee R.,"Manhattan, NY",6,6,0

So I met my bestie (whom travels from Brooklyn to Manhattan to just have lunch with me a few times a week) So first off, went to the hostess and ask to be seated; she sat us at the closest table to the door.... NOT what I expected. So we asked to be seated closer towards the back of the restaurant, she said there was only bar space and that there was a 40 min wait for a table in the main dining hall, after contemplating for 5 mins, I finally said yes to the bar (I hate having a meal at the bar). So the staff that brings water and bread didn't realize she told us to go to the back of the bar, he walked us to the other hostess next to the main dining hall. Luckily the manager was there and he seated us promptly in the main dining area without issue. So on to the food. Again, is restaurant week, so it would totally be crazy of me if I didn't take advantage of the deal. We both ordered the Roast Beet Salad with herbed cheese and mixed green; the beet was totally boiled rather then roasted. For entree, I had boneless rib eye and she had filet mignon ( extra $6). My rib eye was great, seasoned wonderfully and cooked perfectly. Her filet mignon on the other hand was tough and not tasty at all! I almost felt bad that she had to pay an extra $6 for that crap. Dessert was once again the tastiest part of the meal. I had the MJ sundae and she had Brownie. MJ sundae consisted of cinnamon ice cream with caramel & chocolate drizzle with whipped cream and one cherry. While her brownie was decadent and was not overly chocolately. So long story short, if u want to eat great steak and have wonderful service, this is not your place. P.S. My rib eye was suppose to come with broccoli, it came with fried onion rings!!

I opted for the Louisiana Crawfish chowder which was creamy rich and delicious. For an entree, I had the 1/2 chicken with kale and herb jus. This was the first time in many years I ordered chicken in a restaurant but due to the limited choices of interest, I went with the chicken. I found the chicken to be bland and slightly dry with no other culinary enhancements. The kale was modestly seasoned and tasty but no fireworks in the old palate.It really doesn't matter what the rest of the guests at my table had as their experience with the food was just as underwhelming as mine. Needless to say, I am in no hurry to return to have another dining experience at MJ's Steakhouse. There is nothing authentic about it other than it having MJs name on the menu.

I wonder how hard is for them to take one or two mushrooms, slice them up and put them in the burger.Anyway, I did not argue and I told them I'll get the burger medium rare just the way they prepare it, hoping that I would be satisfied with the quality of the meat and cooking, especially for that price.20 mins later we got our burgers and my expectations were shuttered into million pieces....The burger was... meh... flavorless lump of meet covered with some cheddar cheese.I would really give this place one star, but the waiter seemed more than polite, trying to accommodate us as well as he can. So one star plus for the service...I would never come to this place again and would not recommend it to any of my friends.There are way better burgers in the city for half the price.",1,1,0,Michael A.,"Dallas, TX",29,144,219

Quite salty, due to the sea salt sprinkled onto the cooked patty (first time I am experiencing this on a burger).  Way overpriced for what it was.  Also had the more reasonably priced, by steakhouse standards that is, iceberg salad (1/4 wedge for $11) and Grey Goose martini at $15.

But to me a burger made right with high quality prime meat is totally worth it.If you have followed my reviews you will come to know I have a small thing for burgers lolI enjoy them a lot, be it from Schnippers, Bucu, Elevation burger r Hostons It really depends on the mood I am in and the kind of burgers want to eat and how much I am willing to drop on that given day.This burger is closeto what you get at Houston's but even a step higher. When I say it's amazing, it's an understatement.The meat is hand packed and they keep it loosely packed to help keep it more juicy and I can't comment on the blend they use. I have the slightest of ideas but it's a great blend with what seems to be right on point, would say a blend of 80/20 based on the juiciness of the burger.The cheddar they use is aged white and super sharp. Perfection!!!!Bun is a toasted brioche.

2.0,5/26/2012,"Oh Michael.... The best way to describe this steakhouse is to break all emotional ties with Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and realize the reality that is Michael Jordan of the Charlotte Bobcats. Where do I start? First, I patiently waited 45 seconds or so for the young hostess to finish her text before being acknowledged. I'm sure it was a very important message so I didn't mind. In today's instant news society, we all need to know what Lisa wore to the mall. As I looked around, I thought to myself, ""There really isn't a bad table in the house."" It's an open restaurant in the iconic Great Hall of Grand Central. Pretty sweet."" Theeeen I sat down. The table rocked so much I literally looked under the table cloth to see if a leg was missing. Considering I'm not very high maintenance and a bit of a MacGyver type I managed to stabilize the ""cruise ship dining experience"" with an old receipt and three quarters. The night was still salvageable. Onward and forward...The steak... My NY Strip had a perfectly cooked medium rare center. Tender and flavorful just the way I like it.

There are so many venerable and reliable steakhouses in NYC. Palm, Old Homestead, Post House, Peter Lugers. Ben Benson's and Smith/Wol put his place to shame.

1.0,2/7/2012,"This was without a doubt my most disappointing NYC dining experience.  I was part of a group of 7, and we had an 8pm reservation for dinner during Restaurant Week.  We were seated in the middle of the restaurant at an 8-person table next to the waiter station.  We were seated without delay, but once we were seated, we were forgotten about for at least 30 minutes.  Waiters passed by us nonstop, but failed to stop for us.  Finally, after 30 minutes we called someone over to please take our order.  We ordered wine and almost all our glasses had sticky residue on them.  We were served a bread basket, but no bread plates.  Once we ordered, it took almost an hour for our meal to arrive.  Upon cutting into my steak, I discovered it was overcooked and requested it be corrected.  When my steak was brought back out, I politely told the manager that we had been experiencing issues with our service.  Despite letting him know, nothing improved.  It took another 45 minutes before our plates were cleared and dessert orders were placed.In terms of the quality of food, everything was just OK.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was the highlight of my meal.  My entree was the fillet with cauliflower in truffle oil, but there was no truffle taste and my steak was not very tender.  We also had sides of brussel sprouts and creamed spinach; the brussel sprouts were bland, but the spinach was worth getting.  Finally, I had the toffee pudding for dessert; this tasted like a stale muffin to me because it was way too dry.  Overall, my meal reminded me of something I would get at a mediocre banquet.Sometimes I can excuse poor service because the quality of food makes up for it; in this case, I cannot find a single reason to go back to this restaurant and discourage anyone else from trying it.  I have recently been to Del Frisco's, and would suggest going there instead; Del Frisco's was one of my best dining experiences in NYC.",4,2,1,Sheila S.,"Dallas, TX",211,154,55

For my appetizer I had the MOST AMAZING Tomato Bisque that I have ever had in my LIFE! I could eat that bisque all day for EVER! For my entree & side I had the skirt steak with 5 Cheese Potatoes Gratin. My steak was chewy & the potatoes had an overpowering aftertaste from the herbs used (i'm thinking rosemary or thyme)..

3.0,1/1/2012,"(3.50 stars) First, I'll cover the basics.  Michael Jordan is a legend, although not as a chef.  The setting is magnificent; the architecture of Grand Central Station, with the hustle-and-bustle of the station below.  The classic steakhouse dark woods vibe is absent; whether that is a plus or a minus is a matter of personal preference.  Similarly, the dining experience may not appeal to everyone.  Service is definitely oriented to the business lunch/dinner crowd; unobtrusive and, if a stopwatch were employed, unacceptably slow.  The appetizers have always been great, with their crabcakes and the garlic bread fondue leading the pack.  In my opinion, MJ's steaks have deteriorated significantly in the past few years, in the reliability of their doneness and seasoning.  Their side dishes have never been great.  Michael Jordan's is solidly in that second-tier of great New York steakhouses, and like most in this group, stratospheric pricing is more self-flattery than it is an indication of a great steakhouse experience.",10,9,10,Steve G.,"Union, NJ",681,831,0

You're not going to get a quiet, dark mahogany steak restaurant dining experience. Instead, you can get that and many other dining experiences here. Michael Jordan's sits overlooking the grand concourse right under the constellation filled ceiling. You can overlook the concourse and people watch or have a more intense business lunch at a quieter table.  The staff is attentive, the food is delicious and each experience is unique.

In addition, many of their other menu items were priced inexplicably high for what you were getting, but I digress.  Drinks ran the gamut - $10 for a vodka tonic, $4 for coffee, and another $4 for an 8oz. bottled Coke (are you kidding?!).  For dessert, I ordered the included cheesecake, which was OK, but I'm not a huge cheesecake buff, so don't take my word for it.As others noted, this is a great spot for people watching and staff and management are very friendly, but for a place of this caliber, I feel we were nickeled and dimed from start to finish.  If you head over here, stay with the prix fixe menu, or try one of the other three places perched above the councourse.  Of course, there's always two boots and some other nice sit-down picks downstairs in the dining concourse too!",4,0,1,Ryan F.,"Merrick, NY",1643,727,8127

4.0,12/13/2010,"I went to Michael Jordan's for lunch during Restaurant Week, because I think steak is the best RW value.  Michael Jordan's was one of the few steakhouses offering a Restaurant Week lunch menu on a Sunday and I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool.  We sat overlooking the main part of Grand Central on the Vanderbilt Ave side, so it was perfect for people watching.  There were tons of tourists checking out Grand Central and taking photos, and this definitely kept us entertained.To kick off the meal, we could choose between a romaine salad, a tomato and mozzarella salad or a chilled cucumber soup with shrimp.  Naturally, I went with the tomato and mozz salad, and found it to be very good. I honestly expected there to be stacks of tomato and mozz, but it was more of a salad, with arugala and bits of basil tossed in.  Even better, there was chunks of roasted red pepper, and a big slice of tomato at the bottom.  The mozzarella was soaked in a balsamic vinaigrette, and all in all, this was a fabulous dish.  We also asked for the waiter to bring out some bread with the salad (I doubt we would have been given this otherwise)  but there was a great assortment of crackers and breads in the basket.  If you go, definitely request some bread.On to the steak.  Most of us at the table ordered our steaks medium rare, and a few of ours were overcooked.  Mine wasn't too bad - on the ends it was a little overdone, but the middle was perfectly cooked.  There was really no distinction between my friend Amy's medium steak, and our medium rare steaks, so if you want to make sure your steak isn't overcooked, I suggest ordering a steak that is a little more rare that you normally like it.  The steak was also smothered in a spicy sauce which was good.  If you like just tasting the meat though and want to control the amount of sauce on your steak, I'd ask for the sauce on the side.  The sauce though was great on the handcut potatoes that accompanied the steak.  These potatoes were seasoned very well.  We all commented that we thought we wouldn't be full from steaks and frites, but to be honest, I could have thrown in the towel after the second course.For dessert, the waiter suggested the cheesecake.  I was intrigued by the cotton candy on the menu, but he said it was just ok, so cheesecake it was.  There were two strawberries and a blackberry on the plate which tasted great with the cheesecake.  The cheesecake was perfectly creamy and the graham cracker crust was delicious.I'll be honest - I preferred my Restaurant Week experience at Ruth's Chris to Michael Jordan's.  Unfortunately, Ruth's Chris does not offer its menu on Sunday afternoons.  If you are looking to check out Restaurant Week for lunch on a Sunday, I'd recommend heading to Michael Jordan's if you want a solid meal.",1,0,1,Laura F.,"Cortlandt, NY",70,186,18

The server comes over and explains that they are fixing the computer system which has gone down.For our appetizers, I got the cucumber avocado soup and others got the mozzarella tomato salad. My soup was ok, but for those who got the salad, it came with goat cheese instead of mozzarella. We asked the server about it, who insisted that it was mozzarella. She then spoke to the manager, who checked with the kitchen -- lo and behold, he came back, apologized for the goat cheese, and offered us mozzarella cheese on the side. I had originally asked another server for some garlic bread to go with my soup, and he informed me that they were out. Out of garlic bread at 9 pm? Okay....  I then decided to ask the manager for garlic bread. 2 mins later, he comes out with it. Was the first server lying or did the manager ""find"" some garlic bread where there was none originally? Who knows. By this point, we were getting pretty fed up with the service.Entrees came. I got steak (very dry) that came with 4 fries (yes, count 'em) and nothing else. They were out of salmon so a few of my friends got sea bass instead. They said the sea bass was good. For a steakhouse, I was expecting much better steak.Two hours later, the dessert finally arrives. My cheesecake was quite good, and so was the vanilla ice cream option.

1.0,9/9/2009,"You know, after you start going to good steak houses regularly, it takes a place like Michael Jordan's to remind you how hard it really is to run a quality steak house.  The second lesson: Read the Yelp reviews BEFORE I sit down inside the restaurant.  I was by myself, and MJ's was around the corner from my hotel (Grand Hyatt).  I ordered a mojito, glass of house red wine, creamed spinach - light on the cream, and a boneless rib eye steak cooked medium.  After biting into the steak, I also ordered the house steak sauce mentioned in the yelp reviews.Location: Pretty cool, but lacks that ""steak house"" feel.Service: Started out okay, but deteriorated.  It was an empty Tuesday night and my waiter would disappear for long periods of time.  After finishing my meal, I waited for 15 minutes before getting up and walking to the front desk to pay for my meal.  Turns out my waiter was at the restaurant next door obviously having a non-work related conversation (way too much laughing).Drinks: They were both okay.  Nothing special.Creamed spinach:  Apparently my ""light on the cream"" request was lost, if not actually converted into ""Extra cream"".  I barely touched it.Steak: Not the best cut.  Large, large blobs of fat, which is common, but not in an easy to separate or cut off like other places.  Also had some tough tendons or something that made it difficult to cut.  The plate was cold.  As I read the reviews of people saying that, I didn't think it was a big deal, but after experiencing it, now I know why.  Other restaurants' plates are so hot the steak can cook just a bit while on the plate... and keeps the steak warm through most, if not all of the meal.  The steak itself was not medium (pink) anywhere on the steak.  It may average out to be medium, but it was actually very well done for a thick outer layer, and then completely rare in the middle.  The pepper and salt seasoning on the steak was good, but was heavy and I felt that they had to rely upon that because the meat couldn't stand on its own.House steak sauce: Was very good, but I shouldn't need it.Before I started this review, I was planning to give it two stars, but now as I write this and think of the cost, I think one star is plenty.  I won't be going back except for a drink at the bar if I'm at Grand Central Station.",0,0,0,Buddha B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,109,4

Es ist hier zwar extrem teuer aber die Qualität des Essens ist es wirklich wert. Besseres Rindfleisch habe ich bisher nur in Toronto bekommen aber da war es noch teurer. Die Beilagen ( Folienkartoffel, Spargel und Pommes) waren von derartig guter Qualität, das ich es kaum glauben konnte. Das gesamte war ein absolutes Erlebnis, sowohl vom Geschmack als auch vom einzigartigen Ambiente her betrachtet. Die Bedienung war sehr aufmerksam aber arrogant und hat etwas genervt. Das einzige was mich veranlasst hier keine 5 Sterne zu vergeben, ist die Tatsache, das auf der Rechnung das Trinkgeld von 20% schon fest eingerechnet war und man es nicht selbst bestimmen konnte.

After sitting down, we were informed that the restaurant does not participate in restaurant week for dinner but that they are aware that the website says they do. We were told there is nothing they could do but when we almost left, they offered to give us a special menu- but not without a couple of snide comments from the waiter. At that point, we should have left because we were treated horribly throughout the meal. My friend who has Celiac disease was treated like a complete inconvenience to the restaurant and not offered any substitutes that she could eat. She had never been treated so badly at a restaurant. It was impossible to enjoy any of the meal when we were being treated so horribly.We are all in our mid-twenties and while we were going out for restaurant week, we would have been more than willing to spend a large sum of money on a great meal and an enjoyable experience. It is a shame that a well-established (though mostly empty) restaurant like MJ's felt the need to belittle us and act so unprofessional in an understandbly awkward situation. Restaurant week is supposed to allow New Yorkers to enjoy the great restaurants that the city offers at an afforable price, but in this case, MJ's went out of their way to make us feel unwelcome.

3.0,5/28/2009,"This review is going to be unfair, because for 2/3 of the price I would say that this place merits 4/5 stars. But price is a consideration.The service is very good. Our waiter was a real waiter, not a 20-something actor, and he was attentive, knowledgeable and quick. The ratings shortfall comes down to the food, which is OK, but subpar for the price. You do get a view of the main floor of Grand Central Station. Depending on how much that sort of thing interests you, you can either consider the prices a 'view premium' or just think dining at MJs as the equivalent of eating at a 'train station restaurant.' Even absent price, the food is OK, but not great. The crawfish chowder was actually very good. It was the best part of my meal and I would give it a 5/5. My Hendricks gin and tonic ($10) was quite nice and not stingy on the pour. My co-diner (dining colleague?) said his roast chicken was excellent. It was also $24 for what could charitably be called a medium-sized portion. We ordered a side of hash browns ($9) which are served in a sort of pie formation. They were nearly crisped on the outside and not particularly pleasant on the inside, a bit like undercooked hash browns at a diner. The best I can do in describing them is to say they were ""starchy"": neither crisp nor soft. I disliked them. My steak was annoying. For $29, I had the 8oz petit filet mignon. It was meant to be medium rare, but was definitely medium. For that price, there is no excuse for overcooking the meat. The key lime pie ($10) and brownie with ice cream ($8.5) were OK. Seltzer is $4 a glass.Dinner for two with tip: ~$160.

I started with an asparagus, green bean and goat cheese salad in a lemon vinaigrette.

Again with no mention of red peppers (but I will take the blame for this one) the crab cake was crispy, better than something you would find at a TGI Friday's, but again I could do better at home.

5.0,9/25/2007,"Came here for lunch during one of my first visits to New York City, where I was extremely overwhelmed and impressed by the overall density of everything--people, stores, restaurants, hot dog stands...all crammed together and functioning in one space. I had just moved to DC at the time and grew up next to SF, so I was no stranger to large cities, but NYC is unlike anything else. It was a little bizarre to walk into an elegant atmosphere filled with fancy cutlery and formal dressed servers straight from the mad rush and chaos of Grand Central Station, only steps away. We were seated in the center of the open dining room that overlooked the main concourse of the station, felt kind of isolated but still in the center of everything. Kind of how I felt wherever I was roaming around the city. Servers were dressed in a kind of black-tie server attire, carrying silver trays and white linen clothes. The funniest thing about our waiter was that he introduced himself as James, but later in the meal, he confessed his real name was Christopher, and only used James as his server pseudonym. Beyond that, he didn't say much else. I wondered if he went back and forth between 'James' and 'Jeeves.' My high school boyfriend's mother was our host for the weekend, and footed the bill for most of the expenses, including hotel, activities, and food--including this meal. She was certainly gracious, but had a strong, controlling presence and tended to make silent judgments through her intense looks and facial expressions. Generally, she was pretty good at making me feel nervous, and slightly inferior (I'm certain she figured no girl would ever be truly good enough for her son.) We began the meal with finger sized strips of warm garlic bread stacked up like a Jenga game tower with a side pot of garlic fondue. Crispy, garlicky and rich. Next up we shared a couple of Caesar salads--basic recipe, but well done and not overdressed. Finally when it came to select our main course, both mother and son immediately ordered the Filet Mignon. When it came to my turn, the mother turned to me and sweetly suggested I just order a few sides and have a few bites of their meat, well-knowing of my insane appetite and love for steak. I don't think I've ever been treated like a 5 year old, even when I was 5, my parents had enough respect to talk to me as if I were at least 7, since I could make my own decisions. Until this moment. Although I could feel my cheeks on fire, I took a deep breath and calmly responded directly to James/Christopher, ordering a side of fried onions, a side of creamed spinach, a side of mashed potatoes, and, the Filet Mignon (10 oz.). Her surprised eyes and deliberate blinks conveyed a message of ""Well, well, aren't we a little greedy now?"" while my confident grin replied, ""That's right, bitch, I didn't just want to stick it to you, I wanted to stab and twist.""In addition to basking in the glory of enjoying my free steak piece by piece in the presence of an adversary, my dining experience here was quite memorable. The food was excellent, service was impeccable (in the most bizarre and formal way), and atmosphere was insanely sophisticated, even for a casual lunch. Not sure when I'll have the chance to come back here again, but I'm confident that when I do, I don't think I'll have to entertain any patronizing suggestions...unless it's from Michael Jordan himself.",3,7,3,Kelly R.,"Washington, DC",288,520,6

3.0,12/26/2006,"Living on a student budget, my friend chose Michael Jordan's The Steak House N.Y.C. to treat me out to. We arrived a bit early for lunch and had to wait awhile until it was twelve noon.  We started with an Apple Martini and a Riesling.  (What can I say...he's a student living large!)  I appreciated that they left the shaker at my table so I could refill my martini glass.  (There was enough for about two small glasses worth.)I chose the Filet Mignon, Center Cut, 8 oz. ($25.50) and he had the Center Cut Swordfish Steak ($20.50).  I almost want to say that my friend ordered another main entree just because he could.  It's a good thing he did because these dishes didn't come with anything else. Nope, no sides of mashed potatoes or vegetables at all.  Although, you can order those a la carte ($6.50-$9.50 respectively).  My filet mignon was alright, far from spectacular.  I always order my meat rare, bloody rare.  Any true chef knows that means minimal time on the fire.  Well, my meat came out more of a medium rare to medium.  At this point, I couldn't be bothered sending it back.  I hate sending my meat back because that means they have to start off with a whole new piece of beef and if they can't get it done the first time, you have to wonder if they can even get it done the second time.  (I will send it back though if it comes back well done or something 'cuz I just can't eat that at all!)For dessert I had the Summer Berry Cobbler and my friend had the Pineapple Creme Brulee.  The desserts were much tastier than our entrees and we definitely felt like we got more bang for our buck with the desserts. Ambiance wise, it's an interesting space.  As a tourist, it can be a nice place to dine while you're checking out Grand Central Terminal.  I probably wouldn't bother dining here if I lived in NY though.  We were seated near the entrance and the dining area further in was much nicer though.  I can see this place could be romantic if given the right company, but it can be a bit distracting for others.",2,0,2,Teri C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1709,1020,2270
4.0,12/10/2006,"ok so lets be honest here, i'm a huge michael jordan fan and if they were just serving me a hamburger patty and called it a steak i'd probably still be a happy camper.ok so the first time i went here, the atmosphere of restaurant really surprised me.  the location is really prime.  we're talkin' grand central station, overlooking the hustle and bustle of commuters inside one of new yorks famous landmarks.  i've eaten here twice for dinner and both times my rib eye was cooked just right.  the sides are really great.  we've probably tried them all, but i really like the mac and cheese, hashbrown potatoes, creamed spinich and herb roasted mushrooms.all in all i've had a great time here.  even if it didn't have michael jordan  name i would have still enjoyed my meal....maybe that name gave it that extra star or half a star maybe it didn't. (hey at least i didn't go balls out and give it 23 stars, i tried to be as honest as possible.)try it out and you be the judge.grandcentralterminal.com…",1,2,2,Craig I.,"San Francisco, CA",192,508,131
3.0,8/28/2006,I have had some pretty good meals here and a few bad.  Unfortunately in the summer time Grand Central really does not have that much air conditioning so you would be better off choosing a different place if it's hot outside. Either way...Beware of ordering any prefix meal here the portion size is MUCH smaller than when I ordered a normal steak.  The fried onions are great and the veggies are just okay.  Decent wine list. Great spot to look out onto travelers (Grand Central is one of the most amazing places in the city). Always interesting people at the bar.Date Rating: 4Pick up Scale: 4Strong Suggestions:  If you don't want to hike all the way to Brooklyn to Luger's the try Ben & Jacks just up the road.  A waiter from Luger's was one of the guys who opened the place.  Strikingly similar.,4,0,2,Megan C.,"New York, NY",4019,835,1062
1.0,4/6/2006,"Booooo!  A business lunch should not be served for 3 hours no matter what.  Ridiculously slow service and we got something called the ""fast menu"".  Plus they dropped half the hashbrowns next to the table and never came to clean them up.  Wasn't that spectacular food either, I wouldn't reccomend this place.  We did see Anthony Michael Hall in grand central though so we had that going... which was good.",1,1,0,Ted S.,"New York, NY",19,192,0
3.0,1/30/2006,"The steak here isn't bad, and the location is fantastic, but in a city with sparks and peter luger there are better places to go for a steak.  I've been a few times and sometimes the steak is great and sometimes it's not.  The hipness of the place would give it a 5, but inconsistencies here make it only a 3.  It's a shame his steakhouse isn't as good as his on the court performance",1,0,0,Harsh K.,"Los Angeles, CA",348,412,3
5.0,12/13/2005,"I had heard some pretty negative things about Michael Jordan's (service and over-cooked steak), but I found none to be true on my recent visit. I had 7:00pm reservations, was seated and attended to immediately. As the restaurant became increasingly crowded, the service remained quick and pleasant. I had a tasty Caesar salad for an appetizer and ordered the 10 oz Fillet Mignon medium rare. Having heard that the steakhouse had a tendency to overcook the steaks, I asked the waitress that she ask the chef to prepare it ""closer to rare than medium."" It came out perfectly and was delicious. My dinner guest said his was great as well (the beef tips [medium]). The sides were nothing special (we had the sampler) but good enough. The ambience is spectacular. I would definitely go back!!!",0,0,0,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0
