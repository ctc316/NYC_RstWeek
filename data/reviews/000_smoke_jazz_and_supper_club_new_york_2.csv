1.0,4/27/2019,"I went to the Supper club last night for Ella Fitzgerald's birthday celebration. The performance was not worth the 40 dollars per person I spent. The place was tiny, it's an over priced hole in the wall. They claimed to have soul food on the menu, but the food much like the place lacked any such thing. The food portions are disrespectfully small, and my food was lukewarm at best. I ordered the lobster bouillabaisse, which didn't have lobster, but beyond baby langostino tails. The menu said that the dish came with shrimp, and scallops. The shrimp, and scallops all fit into the clams, and mussels. This place is shitty, you can't even move at your table if you happen to enjoy the music. I'm slim, I could barely fit in between the tables to get up to use the bathroom in this cramped place, and to exacerbate the issue the food is just as small, and the people are bougie. If you're looking to have a good time, hear good music, and eat don't go to the Supper club. If you're anorexic, rich, and pretentious this is you place.I wouldn't give this place the 1 star that I did, but I didn't have a  choice.",0,0,0,Sky G.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,4,0

5.0,3/11/2019,"Honestly and truly, Smoke Jazz is awesome. I've heard so many wonderful things about Smoke Jazz and I've been trying to get there for at least the past two years. For some reason or another, I could seem to get there but that's where NYC restaurant week comes in. Btw... If you haven't taken advantage of NYC restaurant week, boy oh boy are you missing out. Now back to Smoke Jazz, as I mentioned, restaurant week has made it possible for me to try several restaurants that I might not otherwise get to and Smoke Jazz is one of them. The restaurant is small and intimate but this amplifies the overall experience. Once the music begins, you really feel as if the musicians are playing just for you. There is not a bad seat in the house. If you arrive early, you should be able to request a table that works for you but of course, that would mean you plan to have dinner at a table and not the bar area. Don't get me wrong, the bar area is ok too. Keep in mind, there is a music/performance upcharge on your bill once the show is over. It's worth it. Before I get into the excitement food, let me take a moment to acknowledge the entire staff. Smoke Jazz operates like a well-oiled machine. I was very impressed with the efficiency of the whole operation. The wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and are willing to answer any questions. Now on to the food. I had the wedge salad and lobster ravioli. Incredible... Is one word that comes to mind. I even had the brownies for dessert and even that was delicious. Well, I'm sure your wondering by now, what about the music? Well, music is a form of art and up to interpretation and although I enjoyed the show and my entire experience at Smoke Jazz, let me take this moment to encourage you to stop reading this and make your reservation now! It's a magical night you will cherish for the rest of your life. Enjoy",1,0,1,Percy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",445,248,524

5.0,2/21/2019,"Smoke Jazz Club is well worth the trip to the 103rd St stop off the 1 train. I went with 3 friends on a Tuesday night to celebrate one of their birthdays and we had an awesome time - tickets for the show were only $15, and then we decided to utilize the dinner reservation that comes along with that (though I *think* that's optional and you can just sit at the bar).The food was a bit pricey but very very good - I'd highly recommend their salmon and trying their mojito. And we also split the calamari, Louisiana shrimp poppers, and croquettes - all of which were quite tasty.Oh, and did I forget to mention that the jazz performance itself was absolutely incredible? Even though it was just a Tuesday night, the act we saw was super talented and impressive. Overall, I'd highly recommend going to Smoke!",2,2,3,Matt B.,"New York, NY",463,10,11
1.0,2/19/2019,The place is beautiful and have good artists coming but it's so pretentious!

2.0,2/16/2019,"Absolutely Great music, but terrible food.On the weekends it's $40 cover charge and each person must get an entree. Entrees are about $38 which I wouldn't mind if they tasted good but unfortunately they didn't. We got the shrimp cocktail which came with 4 shrimps (hehe) & this calamari could be like a $5 calamari from the cheapest restaurant. Ugh. Terrible.We had a 9pm show, were asked arrive at 8:30. We were told we must leave by 10. So for 1.5 hours we spent about $120 per person for terrible food. I would pay $40 for the show again, but the expensive food tasted so bad that I do not recommend this place. Unfortunately won't be coming here again & do Not recommend it.

2.0,2/15/2019,"This was my first time coming to Smoke in a few years and the quality has dropped significantly all around.  I'm disappointed because this used to be one of my favorite places. First, the service was very slow. And the people sitting on either side of us were complaining of the same thing. In addition, the quality of the food was nowhere near as good as it used to be. We had the pork chop and the salmon. Both were bland and uninspired. The mac and cheese that came with the pork chop tasted like it came from a Kraft box, but with less cheese. In terms of drinks, the old fashioned tasted watered down so I switched to beer immediately after the first one. Also note that the prix fixe dessert of chocolate covered strawberries was literally just one chocolate covered strawberry. Another big letdown. What saved the experience was the act that performed; they were amazing. But at such an expensive price point, I expected much more, especially after having been here so many times in the past. Most importantly: be aware that there is a $45 per person music charge in addition to dinner. I would recommend buying tickets in advance online, where they go for $20 per person. The markup at the door is ridiculous. Don't think I'll be back until there's a change in management.",0,0,0,Jason P.,"New York, NY",251,17,0

Me and my wife came here to eat as well and the food wasn't good at all--not even a little bit. The best part of the food was the dessert, only because it was pre-made some where else. I wouldn't take my worst enemy to this place. The first course had no flavor at all like it was done on purpose. Fried shrimp was made so poorly it hurt my soul because I really love food. Second course pork chop reminded me of high school free lunch in terms of breading and flavor . The best part of that was the salad, smh.

5.0,1/5/2019,"Smoke Jazz and Supper Club is small cozy spot featuring an array of talented jazz artists nightly.The acoustics are good, tables are very close, soft dim lighting, full bar and decent wine list.There's a ($45) cover charge for the two nightly sets: at 7pm or 9pm, dinner and drinks are extra. The menu is good for a club, consisting of, small portion shrimp cocktail, salads, croquettes, calamari, Beef Brisket, Fish Tacos, Steak, BBQ Spare Ribs, fried Chicken, Salmon, Cajun Lobster Bouillabaisse, Lobster Ravioli, plus a few desserts.There are also late night sets without dinner (some without cover) if you are inclined to stay out after 10:30pm or midnight. We often go with the dinner crowd and have had the pleasure of enjoying the very talented artist, jazz pianist Renée Rosnes quartet, who is amazing!  Tonight we enjoyed a quintet of top local jazz artists who performed in the John Coltrane Festival running during the Christmas and New Year's holiday season - featuring Eric Alexander on sax, Joe Farnsworth on drums, Larry Willis on piano, Steve Turre on trumpet and John Webber on bass.

4.0,11/7/2018,"We came here on a Sunday night, and this place was PACKED. The show started at 7PM, so they recommended us to get here from 6:15-6:30PM in order to facilitate ordering dinner before the show started. Well due to some traffic, we ended up arriving at 7:05PM. However, the staff was still friendly and even gave us seats around the red plush couch in the middle of the club. It was perfect because we weren't too close to the stereos, but we could still hear the music well. We looked at the menu and decided to split an entree, because we weren't too hungry. However, the server explained to us that we either must order an entree each or we have to do the 3 course meal. Dismayed, we ordered an entree each - but we were glad that they weren't too large that we would feel extra stuffed. The lobster ravioli was savory, although I wished it had more lobster inside the ravioli pieces. There was probably three or four times as much ravioli as there was to actual lobster. I appreciated how light it was. The pork chop was reminiscent of how my mom used to make a certain type of pork chop, so I enjoyed eating it. The true highlight though was the Nutella cheesecake. I knew New York cheesecake was great, but this was straight up spectacular! It was the best cheesecake I have ever had! The cheesecake was light, airy, and soft. There was a dense core of Nutella in the middle, which paired well with the plentiful amount of cheesecake. To our pleasant surprise, at the bottom of the bowl was some chocolate cake! I was worried this $8.95 cheesecake would mostly be cheesecake, but I was elated to see another NY cheesecake twist at the bottom! What a wonderful way to spend the night of my birthday!

2.0,8/3/2018,"The music was good, the review is based on the food and service. The food is mediocre but serviceable, but simply the worst service I've seen. We were there for dinner and show and there was a pre-fixed menu so we ordered everything ahead of time. Our waitress was often late when bringing us our meal, the tables near us were often finishing up before we got our food. And when she wasn't bringing us our food she was nowhere to be found. When we asked another waiter near by, he simply told us our waiter will be with us shortly. As a result, we didn't get our entree until the last song of the set, and when the set had ended, when other people were getting their checks, we still hadn't gotten our dessert even though we ordered the exact same things. Our waitress actually brought us our check before having served us dessert, and when we complained, she brought out the dessert right away - so it's been ready, but she just failed to serve it to us?

3.0,8/3/2018,For the price during restaurant week $120 for two ppl with two drinks($45/pp for just food) the food was only ok and the desert was only a bite size sampler so your appetizer and entree come out to $20 and your sampler dessert $10.. not the best deal.  With tip the bill came out to $140 and we felt like we overpaid for an average restaurant.  The music was great and overall good spot minus the prices which don't deliver.,1,0,0,Nicole A.,"Farmingdale, NY",0,11,0

I know the food at jazz clubs is never really good, but I've never had any that's actually offensively bad. For vegetarians especially, this is a miss--they have one entree option and it's shriveled and cold, which considering the price ($42 for a prix fixe menu and $38 for an hour show) I found to be unacceptable. The staff also wasn't able to offer any alternates to the single vegetarian dish on the menu.

1.0,7/28/2018,"Where do I begin with this place. We just went during restaurant week and the only good part about it was the music and the service. Everything else felt like I was in a super overpriced mediocre tourist trap. This place should consider not participating in restaurant week because the whole point is for people that go during this time to ACTUALLY want to return but I left feeling robbed. The food was the worst part. My husband ate the fried chicken and I had the pork chop.  They were both edible but nothing close to justifying the cost. The dessert included on the restaurant week option was a joke! I had three 1 inch squares of cold brownies and my husband had tiny macaroons. For drinks we ordered a bottle of the house wine. If we wanted some of the better options on their menu for food or dessert there was an up charge. All in all, just to give you an idea we spent $220 before tips which I would have gladly paid if the food wasn't worth $20/$30 at best.

2.0,4/19/2018,Went here Sunday with a group of 25 for the second brunch session for my sister's birthday and was surprisingly disappointed!! The ambiance is awesome... very homely and cozy and authentic jazz club look. The staff is amazingly welcoming and accommodating especially for our large group. The staff was very attentive but....... the most important aspects of the brunch were mediocre at best (THE FOOD)!!! The menu is limited but diverse enough that everyone can find something. I ordered the chicken and waffles and was to say I went home hungry but by choice. I was offered the option to order something else but my group was finishing up their meals so I opted not to reorder. The waffle was small and loaded with so much sugar it tasted grainy with each bite. The chicken was bland and not fully cooked but on the plus side the portion of 4 pieces would have been welcomed if it had some taste. At least 7 people in my party had to send their chicken back so it wasn't a fluke! Others in my group agreed the waffle was a diabetic shock to the system and theirs were quite a few complaints of the waffle size. The burger was the 2nd item most ordered in our group which seemed to escape complaint. My sister said the salmon was perfectly cooked but definitely lacked flavor. The atmosphere of this place is so adorable but don't go hungry!! Forgot to mention the size of the champagne glass for the mimosa's was a slap in the face for $11.

The jazz performance was good. However, maybe it was our luck, but the performance was kind of melancholic instead of energizing. It was Friday, so I expected some energy going.

Jury is still out if the ravioli is frozen or not. The ravioli was buried in red sauce that was not seasoned at all - and complexly masked the taste of any ""lobster"".

Now for the food...When 2 of our trio arrived we told them that the third was have subway trouble (what else is new). We opted to sit at our table order drinks and wait and told the waiter as much. After getting our drinks about 10 minutes later the waiter asked again and we said our third still hadn't arrived his response: ""can't you just put in an order for her?"" I got annoyed because they're brunch menu for restaurant week isn't posted online so at that point how would she even know what she wanted. Though we did decide to email her a photo of the menu she ordered and we placed the order. I asked if I could order something on it's own that was available on the rest week brunch menu ""truffle onion soup.""  And then ordered my meal off the regular menu. The didn't tell me the price but, the soup is $16 on its own! Delicious, but well over-priced. While catching up with my friends and listening to the music the woman ""in charge"" came over and actually told us to be quiet, while at the same time we looked around and noticed many other tables enjoying themselves and talking with no issues. The meals arrive...or I should say 2 of the meals arrive and the person delivering the food says ""I do t have any order for you.""  Yup! I ordered chicken and waffles at regular full menu price and they didn't even cook it. I told my friends to enjoy and eat because I didn't want their food to get cold waiting for my food to cook but the guy didn't even come back. I had to flag the rude woman down to find out what was going on. She says they'll cook it. Oh gee thanks! A little while later she comes back and say sorry for the wait your food will be on me. Situation rectified...eh. My food finally comes and it's ok. Not the best chicken and waffles I've ever had...by can you say hangry much. In the meantime, I had to flag the waiter down again to ask for another drink because he didn't bother coming back. He wrapped the remainder of my food and brought the bill. Friends got their desserts which, in my eyes, could have been bigger. My word could you spare some flour? And make the eclair a smidge bigger than a pinky finger. So to the bill, we figure it out and go to pay and what we get charged ends up being more than the bill. I had paid my third but as my friend is paying I ask him what's going on. He says oh I gave you the bill I printed before you ordered the drink. So I ask for the bill (to figure out tax and tip) and he says I will bring it after you pay. I'm trying to tell him we want to put the tip on the cards and he says nope too late to get the correct bill. WTF?  I say ok fine no tip he responds ok well that doesn't just go to me. Hmm if you are the representative for the pooled tip jar then maybe do better at your damn job you fool. I am so frustrated I go to leave as my friends are getting themselves together.

We came for the 7pm show which was a great selection of Jazz performance. Great talent!

I see other people complain about this too so I'm not sure why the place would continue with this questionable practice. -1 point for that.Vincent Herring quartet was spectacular.

2.0,12/3/2017,"My parents drove from Chicago and I booked reservations because of the great jazz music and the brunch menu. The usual singer Anita was not there, and the items that both my parents and I wanted to order, they ran out of! A popular restaurant running out of food-- how does that work? No chicken & waffles, no sea bass, and no more bagels for the salmon platter and my dad ended up having to order yogurt & granola. The food was just okay, besides the fact that we couldn't order what I really wanted. My parents didn't drive 12 hours all the way from Chicago for their first brunch day to be a fail. 2 stars is the best I can do because even though the usual singer wasn't here today, her replacement Jackie Jones and her pianist and drummer were pretty good.

Would have preferred a plate to use a knife and fork on. Come on it is a nice and pricey night out. Love collards and the two forkfuls in a small cermaic dish at the bottom of the basket were very good but very, mind you, very small serving.  My meal was a wash.  His was the lobster/scallop hand rolled ravioli in vodkah sauce. Flavorless in all regards not enjoyed.  Skip that entree.  Cocktails and wine choices were very good.  Service slow at our side of the club and our server wasn't very visable thoughout the night although we saw others moving about.  Remember it's all about the jazz and the music will never disappoint even if the food does.",0,0,0,Joan T.,"White Plains, NY",23,75,4

We were practically on stage. We read the instructions carefully so we knew what to expect in terms of fees and the $38 prix fixe on weekends. The best deal is the weekday as it's only $9 per person for the fee. For the prix fixe, everything on the menu is on offer but there's a supplement charge if you want one of the more expensive dishes. I was pleasantly surprised to find the food excellent. I wasn't sure if this would be the kind of place where the music is great but the food is average. We had the French onion soup, beef short ribs and steak. My short ribs were excellent. It came in a cast iron dish nestled with mashed potatoes, collards, pearl onions and a rich brown gravy. My partner's NY strip steak wasn't the best cut despite the price. It was huge but he was disappointed with the overall cut and taste.The show was great and I was impressed with the caliber of talent.

Plus, the people here were very rude to the musicians. I know I shouldn't hold that against the establishment, but I just thought I'd let that out there.The minimum payment of $20 was a bit much for a short jazz show.

I noticed some other customers weren't even talking to each other during their meal because they were just too busy enjoying the music. I like that it was great even for families, some of the kids really enjoyed the show too. I'm seeing in some other reviews that people had to pay for the show and were required to spend a certain amount for their meal...was not the case for us, perhaps because it was brunch.About the food:* Free bread - the banana muffins weren't bad, but I really liked the brioche with whatever sauce was on it already + orange jam (the server called it a syrup...), but beware you might get too full* Chicken and waffles, $18.95 - I loved the syrup, but chicken was a bit too crispy. I also would have preferred other parts of the chicken with less bone so I didn't have to use my hands and could actually eat it with the waffle. At least the waffle was on point.* Smoked salmon, $16.95 - I like that the salmon wasn't smoked too much that it overwhelms you and the bagel wasn't crispy. Conveniently how I like it when my friend's preferences were opposite haha. Tasted great with the cream cheese and arugula salad. Only thing I did not like about our experience was getting the bill and being surprised by the $10 charge for still water. I think we had trouble understanding the server's accent when she asked us if we wanted water, and I noticed a couple other tables almost had the same thing happen to them.

The food is going to have to be spectacular to raise this crowded sight-line-challenged place above two stars. The wine is ok. So far, not so great. The arugula salad is bitter. It's not baby arugula, and the few bits of flavorless pomegranate and canned tangerine and aren't enough to offset the bitterness. The salad also had some tasteless white slices of either endive or celery root. The three of us who had the salads as an app quit after eating less than half. I'll talk about the steak if it ever shows up... Ooh! It's here! Ok. The steak has a good smokey taste, but it's barely warm. Granted I ordered it rare, but if you get a rare steak to the customer right away, it should still be nice and warm. Especially on the outside. It's also too fatty. And we're now halfway through the music set because the food came so slowly, so no time to send it back. The music was good. And it sounded good. And that's the reason to come here, so three stars.

I enjoyed the short rib, and my wife was happy with the pork chop.  It is a bit on the pricey side, especially considering the cost of the tickets. And while they offer a prix fixe menu on select nights, it seems every other entree and dessert involves an upcharge on top of that. Service got off to a slow start--it seemed only one server was working, but soon others filled in and the rest of the evening, service was very good. Like some NYC jazz clubs, the restaurant really packs the chairs in so it can tight to get in and out of tables, and they place tables immediately adjacent to the band, which is also a little too cozy. I also didn't like that most of the tables were set perpendicular to the band, so most of the audience is either forced to look left or right to watch the band, which isn't exactly the most comfortable position. This place isn't quite as bad as Blue Note, but there are more comfortable spots to see fine jazz in the city.  My advice: Arrive early for your show to get a more desirable seat.",1,0,0,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,835,147

But I'm inclined to say that food quality issues go deeper than just a high volume/low cost special.Service was awkward and slow (no refills, rounds, or waters unless they were specifically asked for). Also, the people next to us were loud, and a third person joined them at their 2 person table halfway through the show (so basically squeezed in at our table) but the servers/bouncers never did anything about this.Shrimp cocktail was a little sketchy, and consisted of 4 shrimp. The chicken I ordered came out in a cast iron dish like it had been roasted in it, but the dish itself was ice cold? So it was a fake ""roasted"" dish! The chicken itself was super dry and almost inedible. My boyfriend had a steak, ordered medium rare, that came out well-done and so fatty that he (not a picky eater!) also couldn't eat his meal. My mom had the fish tacos, and frankly they were the only edible thing on the table, though they were super plain fried fish tacos. Finally, dessert was actually humorous-- a creme brulee that had not been bruleed, strangely bland cannolis, and a peanut butter chocolate pie that tasted like ""dirt with a hint of nuttiness"", and everyone at the table had one bite before it was pushed aside. Honestly, peanut butter chocolate pie! How can it be bad?!?!The music is good, and the atmosphere is swanky and nostalgic. That's it. Maybe if you've got the extra cash (since it's pretty pricey to pay for both a show + a two item minimum, where wine and cocktails are easily $13/each), it'd be worth coming in for a few drinks at the bar while listening to some jazz.

Luckily we had the jazz to keep us entertained.  But for near $300 for a meal for two and wine, a 3 hour sit down, and pretty poor food, I may of well hosted a party for the superbowl.  If you're going to have such a long wait and you know it, tell your customers and offer a free round or two.  For this price tag, I'd expect a lot more..",0,0,0,Andrew C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

After emailing and contacting Smoke Jazz for over a month, I was either given the runaround or simply not responded to.

Didn't give 5 stars, because I really wanted the french onion soup. Only the hungry yelper's will understand me... =*( *if you come, please don't carry conversations.

And, here's the surprise, ORGANIC chicken!!! As a foodie, this is what I buy for myself, I'm a Whole Foods market organic grocery shopper. It was elegantly prepared and presented, and tasted delicious. I was actually blown away by this meal, as jazz clubs typically serve food which is OK, this was hands down better than many 5-star meals I have had. Props to the kitchen. I visited on Saturday night, 8/20/2016 for the 10:30 show. One star off due to the bathroom door being right next to the stage (there is only one small bathroom).

2.0,8/16/2016,"Came for restaurant week. They have a minimum noise policy because of the band. The jazz band played super loudly. Like there's no way to converse. You're pretty much forced to listen to the music that's blaring into your face. I thought it'd be soft jazz playing in the corner, not like a jazz show that also serves dinner. It was at Rock and roll/metal loudness. Maybe I'd feel differently if I LOVED jazz. This place, you'd really have to LOVE jazz. You come here for the music and the band and you just happen to have dinner while watching the band. This is not a dinner place with music in the background, which is what I was expecting. I don't mind jazz; I just don't want it screaming at me while I'm trying to have dinner. Definitely disappointed with that aspect.In terms of food, not great. Calamari was nothing special.

My boyfriend ordered the Belgian Waffles with bacon, pecans, strawberries, and maple syrup. I opted for the Eggs Benedict over english muffin, topped with Canadian bacon and hollandaise, with a side of tater tots and organic baby green salad. The portions were filling. Both were good but I wouldn't say great. The live band experience definitely outweighs the quality of the food. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking to catch up with company.

The space was very cozy and it was relaxing just sitting at the bar and listening to the band on stage (who were very good, by the way). They have a bar but also a space directly in front of the stage for sit down dining. There is a $12 cover for sitting at the bar and then you can't spend less than $20 for food and drink. We decided to stick to drinking, since the food looked very expensive ($25 for a burger, what?). I believe there is also a cover and some other rules about sitting at the tables, so it would be good to find out before you go in. I also wouldn't come here in a large group or if you have the intention of catching up or talking with people. They ask that you respect the bands on stage and stay quiet while they perform, so there isn't a lot of conversation going on (also because it would be hard to do above the music).",7,0,2,Rachel R.,"Manhattan, NY",111,166,11

4.0,3/23/2016,"Really love this place. I'm never a fan of the jazz club formula where you're sat, rushed through dinner and given a bill to force you out for the next seating. Do I understand that jazz clubs might have limited opportunities to make their money in a short amount of time? Perhaps....or that patrons might take advantage and sit all night with one drink in-hand. I get it. Therefore I do recommend hitting the 9pm show for Prix Fixe dinner $38. Weekdays only I believe - Tuesday night's are my go to. If you sit through the 9pm typically you can stay at your table or the bar seating without being bothered and you'll cruise through the 1030pm performance. If you're feeling like pulling a late night, some of the younger acts that jump on stage at midnight have been really talented and you get a glimpse of the next generation of jazz to come. Great stuff. Since I'm a local, this is my spot, and for sure recommend it as long as you're doing the 9pm dinner show or after. Catfish was decent, the Brussel sprouts needed some kick, and the chocolate brownie dessert needed more marshmallow. You're going for the music :)",0,0,0,Justin M.,"Manhattan, NY",42,9,0
5.0,3/5/2016,"A quality experience! The Jazz for the most part is at a very high level here. The food is decent as well. They do have a reasonable prix fixe for under 40 dollars. The bartenders mix great cocktails here. Would recommend the Sidecar and the Dark and Stormy here. After 1130 on most nights, there is no extra musical cover charge, just a 20 dollar drink/food minimum. Some of the headlines that have played here are true alltime legends - Gary Bartz, Eddie Henderson, and Bob Cranshaw. My favorite House bands that play the Round Midnight sessions include William Delisfort, Johnny O'Neill, and Captain Black's Big Band. They even have a Hip Hop inspired after hours session led by Nickel and Dine Ops on Thursdays nights that is quite good. The only after hours evening that doesn't quite measure up is the Tuesday Night session done by the Emmet Cohen Trio. They're talented but I didn't feel they gave proper respect to the art form.

When we arrived at 915pm for a 930 reservation, the previous show was not finished yet and we were told to wait outside on the left side.

4.0,11/9/2015,"Small, but nearly perfect. Amazing music. 4.5 stars.Smoke Jazz is small. Really, really small. Even by NYC standards small. There are chain restaurants in the mid-west that have bathrooms larger than this place. The whole place is - and I'm not exaggerating - about the size of a suburban living room. To pay the bills, they pack in guests like sardines, in two narrows rows of tables plus some seats at the bar. There's room for maybe 50-60, all elbow-to-elbow. The only place that's packed in tighter is economy class seating on an airliner.It's definitely not for the claustrophobic, or even those who have issues about personal space. You'll need to coordinate with your neighbor to turn your seat to face the stage.The good new is that a small space is, almost by definition, an intimate space. Even the tables in the very back are great seats, and the front table are so close you could play the instruments yourself. For several reasons, this makes Smoke a great place to experience live jazz.For starters, it sounds great. The acoustics are great, and the sounds system, which might not even be needed, is setup well enough that's it's basically transparent. From such a close distance, you can also get a real sense of just how talented these guys on stage are. We attended the Saturday night show of the Russell Malone Quartet. Watching him play guitar is like watching a magician - his fingers are just that fast. Willie Jones, on drums, was amazing. He played a cyborg robot on fire... always perfect, yet with intense passion as needed. (And somehow without breaking a sweat, even in a suit under the stage lights). Rick Germanson (whose family was seated two tables over from us) was amazing on piano. The new kid, Luke Sellick on bass, kept up well all night but was a little rough in the solos. Overall, it's a great experience. Like seeing music at a friend's house. If, someone, your friend new some of the greatest jazz musicians in the world.The focus here is on the music, but the food here is pretty good as well. The first two sets of every evening are for dinner guests; they recommend you arrive an hour early to have time to eat. Prices are perhaps a bit of the high side, especially given the somewhat hefty coverage charge for the music (the cover charge varies by night, depending on the talent), but the food is good and tasty. The fried chicken is definitely recommended. Given the tight spaces, service is pretty good. The wait staff has gotten pretty good and squeezing into tight spaces, and they are especially good at being unobtrusive, yet still responsive, once the music starts. On a night with major talent in the house it can get pretty expensive (the music charge is $9-40, and then there's dinner, tax, and tip on top of that). There's a serious lake of elbow room. But live jazz, in a small club, is a true New York experience.",5,4,3,Jon L.,"Forest Hills, NY",67,151,32

Brussel Sprouts and Quinoa Fritters were fresh, colorful, and flavorful. It felt like some heart and effort were actually put into these two. The fried chicken was also very good and fatty - you could definitely taste the honey in it. Among the better fried chickens I've had in the city (probably in the top 25th percentile). The presentation of it was enough to make me smile, too. Dessert was a bit subpar though - nothing special about the brownie.Also, they really made the menu vegetarian/vegan friendly which I don't see much in other places of similar cuisine.Service was very tentative.Acoustics were controlled well - great vibe in combination with the space and ambiance. We came through on a night with tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander. An awesome pleasure to listen to.In total, a three course dinner - where the servings were plentiful - along with the ambiance and great music makes this a place well worth visiting.

5.0,9/27/2015,"Intimate, sexy, sophisticated, unbelievable sound acoustics, and great food combine to give you and experience you'll remember for a long time.  My wife and I have been to many jazz venues but never to Smoke. We went there 9/26/15 to see the Buster William Quartet having tried to make last minute dinner reservations for our anniversary but they were full.  We ended up going to the 10:30 pm show and having dessert there instead. We loved it!!  We both have been to a number of music venues but Smoke provides an experience which is a cut above in my opinion. The small room leads to very tightly spaced tables but frankly the ambiance and feel of the place doesn't make you feel like it. The stage sits at the back of the room but the worst seat in the house can't be more than 100 feet away.  They have a limited dessert menu but what they have works, my wife had the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding and I had the Cheesecake which were great. The service was efficient and very polite. Folks all around us were having late dinners and although we were full from just having dinner elsewhere, it all looked so good we seriously debated having dinner a second time.  :-)The small intimate setting, great acoustics and close proximity to the musicians comes at a price.  Smoke is not inexpensive with $38 music charge last night and a $20 food or drink minimum. That said I found their menu prices to be in line with the quality and NYC area.After the 10:30 show they have less well known Jazz artists come in but the O'Neil Group we saw was also excellent and fun.  There's no music charge after midnight but a $20 food/drink minimum that the waitresses waived for us since the room had a few open tables and we had covered the earlier charge.   I would recommend Smoke any time but If you see an early Broadway show in mid-town you can have dinner here late and stay late.  You can also listen to some great music into the early morning hours cheap after midnight any time.

4.0,7/26/2015,"My boyfriend and I just went to see Head of State perform here last Friday night. I have to admit I'm not really into jazz but we had a great time. Sometimes it's nice to do things out of your element. We saw the 10:30 pm and I would honestly suggest that time because the place is really small but starts to clear out by 10:30. I think their most popular time is 9pm. The tickets were kinda pricey (85 dollars and change) but it was worth it, I ordered them online. You also have the option of purchasing them at the place and its 5 dollars cheaper. Lucky for us it's restaurant week so they had a reduced menu where you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for only 38 dollars. Not bad at all. I had the Jack Daniels BBQ chicken with collard greens and it was absolutely delicious. The desert wasn't so good. You could only chose from the s'mores brownie which was very dry or the berries with whip cream. My boyfriend ordered the berries and lucky for me he doesn't like sweets so I got to try it. I would prefer that. I would definitely recommend this place but see a show either at 7 or 10:30 if your looking for more space and I probably wouldn't go on a weekend but I guess it depends on who is playing because this was the Head of States album release party.  Our bill came out to 119 only because we had a few drinks. But all in all I had a great time and I would recommend this place. Even if you don't like jazz it's a nice place to go and relax with friends or the one you love.

They definitely put on a great show.The food didn't disappoint us either. We did the three-course prix-fixe deal. For appetizers, we got the popcorn shrimp and Caesar salad. The shrimp were beer-battered and delicious. The salad was one of the better Caesars I've had (they also put whole anchovies on it, if that's your thing). For an entree, I got the lamb sliders. Those were reeeeeeeally good. The buns were so perfectly shaped and toasted, they almost looked fake. The meat was tender and juicy. They topped it off with an aioli sauce and caramelized onions. Perfect. It came with fries which were nothing special, but the sliders were worth it. Dessert was a really tasty s'mores brownie, which I was truly sad I couldn't finish since I was getting so full.The waiter was also super attentive and had a great attitude. I never had to wait for a drink or anything. They have that place run like a well-oiled machine.

The fries were also very tasty.I was torn between ribs or fried chicken for my main course, but finally decided on fried chicken. It came with collared greens with bacon and corn bread, all in a cute basket. The fried chicken was wonderful - Crispy, fresh, full of flavor, and plenty of it - I ended up taking half of it home. The corn bread was pretty good- crumbly, warm and smooth. The collared greens amazing - Just the right amount of salt, and the loved the taste of bacon.Dessert:  S'mores Brownie. I would have appreciated other options, but the brownie was pretty darn good. The brownie came with sweet marshmallow fluff and sauce on top. The brownie was incredibly chocolaty (it even had chocolate chips), rich and the marshmallow complemented it perfectly.While we were eating our meal, we had the privilege of seeing Baylor Project perform, featuring Jean Baylor, Marcus Baylor, Allyn John-piano, Marvin Sewell-guitar, and Richie Goods-bass. At first it was just instrumental which was nice, but I've never been a huge fan of jazz so didn't do much for me. Then, singer Jean Baylor came up to perform with the band.

4.0,12/28/2014,"Just went here last night for a birthday and the Jazz was out of this world, the food was phenomenal and the staff was nice. My only dislikes were that:- They're shows are so close together that they can't seat you or even let you in until the last group has cleared, so we had to grab a drink elsewhere while waiting and then come back. Then at the end of the show while still eating our dessert we felt very rushed to get up and leave because people were waiting to get in for the next set. The place being small doesn't help but it would have been nice to leave more time between shows so you can enjoy the experience a little more. It would have also been nice to tell us they couldn't seat until a certain time so we didn't show up so early thinking to grab a drink at the bar. - We told them we were celebrating a 30th birthday and all they did was bring the dessert with a candle. No singing by the staff or announcement on the stage. I'm sure they're keeping it classy and that's fine, but we wanted to sing for such a milestone and yet it was treated pretty insignificantly.

2.0,12/14/2014,"Went here for an anniversary dinner and was expecting good food AND good music. Unfortunately I only got one...Decor and atmosphere was great. The lighting is appropriately dim with the prime focus being on the stage. The place is quite small but makes the experience that much better. The musicians are only 15 feet away from your table! The music itself was very good and surpassed my expectations. I would come back here just for the music if there wasn't a dining minimum.For dinner my girlfriend and I each got the $38 prix fixe which includes an appetizer, main entree and desert each. For starters I had the popcorn shrimp and callamari which was very good. No complaints here. My girlfriend had the lobster bisque which was also good albeit a little different than the creamier bisques I am used to. The main entrees is where it starts to get bad. I paid the upcharge to get the steak and french fries. My steak was a large portion but overall pretty terrible. The meat was tough and lacked flavor. My steak contained two separate large pieces of cartilage that I had to awkwardly spit out midway through dinner. The fried onions they put on top were bitter and inedible (too much baking soda in the batter?). Would not recommend to anyone especially if you pay full price for it during non prix fixe weekend dinner.My girlfriend ordered the sea scallops with bacon. At first I was shocked by the portion size (c'mon only 3 scallops on a bed of lettuce). They tasted OK but came out rather cold and nothing sounds worse to me than cold scallops.Finally came desert. Once again these were good but nothing to write home about. The chocolate brownie desert they serve with prix fixe was hard and felt like i was going to flip over the tiny table while trying to break off a piece. I wasn't expecting much with the desert given the other reviews I've read on yelp and was satisfied with what I ended up getting. The terrible part of this experience came after dinner. No less than 20 minutes after leaving the restaurant and while on the subway back home we both came down with food poisoning. I'm pretty sure it was the sea scallops (cold and improperly cooked?).

For our meals, we got the lobster, sausage, & shrimp jambalaya and the seafood pasta - the latter was better. Drinks were a bit pricey for what you get... But just like the table size, you get over it with the cool jazz music.",3,0,0,Josh D.,"New York, NY",44,36,167
3.0,7/29/2014,Smoke is a pretty intimate venue. I was practically sitting on the drum kit--which was cool as I could really see the musicianship and drumstick change-ups. The artist when I was there was amazing (Cyrus Chestnut) and it was his new CD debut. The food is decent--much better than I was expecting as I was primarily going for music. I would definitely go back.,0,0,0,Bev W.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,28,6
5.0,7/29/2014,"Yummy food (ask the waiter for recommendations; they know what's up) and AMAZING jazz. It's an intimate space with table and bar seats, and it fills up quickly. Wonderful place for date night or going with a few friends. The inside feels very intimate and warm, with dim lights and a velvety backdrop. If you care a lot about seeing the full stage and all the musicians, make a reservation and get there early - the front few tables give you great views. The tables farther away are better for talking and give more privacy though, if that's what you're going after. If you only want some drinks and no food, you will get a bar seat. The acoustics will be great no matter where you sit! I've been to several other jazz lounges and bars downtown, and I'd say Smoke is overall more romantic and less crowded, and the music is definitely on par with more well-known places.",0,0,0,Gerry S.,"New York, NY",0,31,0
2.0,7/29/2014,"I have visited smoke on two other occasions and was very satisfied with the food as well as the service. This time it was a total disaster. We arrived at the time of our reservation only to be told to come back because they had no tables available. When we finally received our table it was almost time for the set to start so the waitress rushed us to make our food selections. I had the popcorn shrimp and my husband had the calamari. The shrimp had no seasoning. For dinner I had the jambalaya which was cold when brought to me and the shrimp was undercooked. My husband had the bbq chicken which was also cold. When we tried to get the waitress to let her know this all she kept repeating was ""I will be with you in a minute"" That minute never came. As for the band for the night the singer was very unprofessional in my opinion. The band would stop in the middle of a song and start over. When it was time for the next song they would have what the singer called ""A meeting"" to discuss what should be the next song.  The singer was on stage using profanity and their happened to be children in the room.  This experience was not a good one. While I have had a good time previously at smoke. This one bad experience has made me rethink going to smoke again.  I would advise that you check to see who the performer is for the night before making a reservation.",0,0,0,Tay S.,"North Plainfield, NJ",0,3,0

Just after they started up the legendary alto sax player Lou Donaldson came to listen. He was 88 years old at the time and it was midnight on a Sunday night. He grooved the whole night till 2 am.

My husband had the hamburger that was very very good and I had the Jambalaya which was filled with shrimp, large pieces real crab meat. It was delicious. I wanted to try the chicken wings or the fried chicken but passed on the finger foods only to find myself sitting between two parties who ordered one of each. They were excited to partake in the dining experience. One young lady began eating the fried chicken with a fork and knife only to find herself about 2 minutes into the meal ditching the utensils and decided to go in on the chicken...hard...she steamed cleaned the bones.. I wanted to pull out my camera but refrained as this is a classy venue.

3.0,6/26/2014,"There's really only one word to describe Smoke....TINY! or intimate depending on how you see things.My sister made reservations at this place for Father's day. Because it's so small I'm pretty sure that you actually have to have a reservation to get in so, make sure you check on that before you just show up.They run a pretty organized service for such a small establishment, but I guess they don't really have a choice. You make a reservation for which ever show you want to see. During that time they run through a very quick dinner/brunch service, and no one is allowed in or out (it seems) until the show ends.The food seemed like it would have been very good. I didn't eat much of mine because like a dummy I ordered the soft shell crab sandwich not realizing that there's actually still shell on it. I assumed that was just the name of the type of crab. Anyway, it was pretty inedible (in my opinion). It was just a strange never ending crunch of shell that continued to get stuck in my teeth, awful. So, I avoided the crab, and just ate my fries which were pretty good. We came during brunch so, my sister and niece had chicken and waffles which looked tasty, and my parents had the ribs which also looked pretty good. I will warn you that like most of these tiny, hipstery, brunchy places in the Manhattan and Brooklyn the food was expensive! Expect to spend about $30-$40 per person.The live music was very very good. I can't remember the singer's name, but she did a great job. Her and the band did about 4 or 5 sets which was enough to get us through dinner.Overall I wasn't crazy about the food, so I took one point off for that, and it's so tiny that you'll have to practically step over people to get to your seat so, another point off for that. That said, the entertainment was enough to make me want to come back a second time.",3,3,3,Akilah L.,"SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, NY",267,81,53

Great music - but you have to quiet while the sets are on.There is usually a bend that plays after main jazz sets -in late hours - that doesn't require cover charge and usually provide  great vibe and music.The only reason why there is no 5 stars from me - the service is often very slow and inefficient.,0,0,0,Dani O.,"Manhattan, NY",23,146,202

I don't normally choose places based on reviews, but this place definitely lives up to its rating. Inside is super comfortable and exquisite. And you get VIP treatment before you even walk in the door. My date and I were getting out of a cab and the guy at the door held the door open for us. Talk about impressive.  Then we got in there was no waiting someone showed us right to a table, but my date wanted to sit at the bar instead. They gave us no hassle whatsoever.  The place was packed, but not overcrowded. Everybody had a seat. Everyone appeared to be upperclass too - executive types, mostly white but a handful of upperclass blacks too. The music is smooth and at the perfect volume. Unlike a lot of places where musicians fumble around on stage, the musicians here didnt mess around. Very professional. And dont come in there loud talking..they will shhsh you. We made that mistake but the bartender kindly explained to us no loud talking. And WARNING: its $38 per person just to sit down, plus a $10 minimum on food & drinks.

5.0,4/22/2014,"*This review is strictly for brunch!*I LOVE THIS PLACE! This was the last brunch place I went to during my stay in NY and it was amazing! There was no cover charge in the morning and the jazz music starts at 11:30AM (place opens at 11AM). The place was pretty small, but there weren't that many people surprisingly, maybe because it was Easter Sunday. I got the Salmon Scrambled Egg and my friend got the Chorizo benedict. Since I thought the place was mainly for music, I didn't think the food was going to be spectacular. However, the food was delicious and not too pricey! They definitely did not skimp on the smoked salmon for the scrambled egg so I was really happy about that. Plus, they gave us little scones and crackers with jelly and butter before our meal.The jazz musicians that played were also amazing, and probably a little better than the other jazz club I went to as well. I also tried the Ritz cocktail from their menu and the drink was also great. Fresh OJ and champagne never fails :) With the great food, great music, and great drinks, I highly recommend this place for brunch if you want to spend a good hour listening to jazz and eating great food.

Interaction is easy because it's so small, but I can also come here and feel anonymous, yet welcome :) The hosts and waitresses are always very kind and do their very best to accommodate you, and the jazz musicians are very often friendly and approachable. I typically bring my guests here, and they are consistently delighted. I know what days to come and get the most of my evening, usually on the nights with no cover, and a 20$ consumption minimum.

Gregory, thank you for the free CD and I hope your wife had a beautiful birthday. I ordered the jumbalaya and the portion was huge.

Mr. Gregory Generet (who is married to the lovely Tamara Tumi, watching her husband perform 3 sets with such love, admiration and appreciation was fantastic!), the man is gifted! The range of his voice, it was as if it was an additional instrument to the already talented band he had with him! He sang everything from classic Jazz, a few blue tunes to an incredible rendition of ""What's Going On.""  This spot was a gem!There was one drawback... the food.  I had the southern fried chicken, I try to stay away from fried food, but friend chicken at a jazz joint... what could go wrong, right? A Lot could go wrong! My chicken was dry, bland, and greasy - all at the same time! I was momentarily crushed... until the music started playing! The drinks were very generous and strong!So if you're in the neighborhood, if you have a date that loves Jazz music, by all means stop in - this place will not fail to impress the most discerning jazz lover!",0,0,0,Maria C.,"Nutley, NJ",109,21,18

1.0,7/31/2013,"After reading the reviews on Smoke Jazz and Supper Club l was left confused. So for those who like me couldn't make heads or tails of this establishment, this review is for you. First, the venue - this place is extremely small. And there is a big support beam in front of the stage so unfortunately many of the seats have obstructed views. They have several shows each night (including several dinner shows), patrons are expected to order fast, drink fast, eat fast and get out fast! As a patron you're left with that feeling of being herded in & out of this establishment like cattle. Second, the food - I ordered the Blackened Catfish and my wife ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. Some of the pictures on this site show great pictures of the chicken. Let me just say ""everything that glitters ain't gold."" The pictures look great however, you can't judge seasoning from the pictures of food.This dish could not have been anymore bland! My wife was totally disappointed. Even after attempting to revive this dish with table salt and pepper, the dish was dead on arrival! The Blackened Catfish was also under seasoned, which was a surprise for me, because blackened dishes are usually over seasoned and to spicey for my taste. This dish was at least eatable, however, It wasn't good, it wasn't  great, it was just ok. For desert we shared the Banana Foster Bread Pudding. The pictures of this dish (on this site) made my mouth water. Banana Fosters is one of my favorite deserts. It was horrible! First time l've had Banana Fosters made with plantains. The bread pudding was cold, the plantains weren't cooked completely, the sauce i'm certain is that butterscotch topping (usually used for  ice cream sundaes) warmed up and the dollop of cream on top added nothing! The food here is a major disappointment. Third, the drinks - the cocktails are so watered down we only had one drink each (highly unusual for us). This is definitely a beer and wine spot. Fourth the service -The service we found attentive and I'm sure it is because they are herding people into and out of here, so they must keep you on pace. Lastly the music - We saw Javon Jackson and he was phenomenal! He's funny, talented and plays an awesome sax! What we learned - Don't go to the dinner shows at Smoke Jazz and Supper Club the food is not worth it. Best seats are at the bar in front of the pole obstructing most patrons views. Forget about ordering cocktails and stick with beer or wine. If you go, go for the music, because everything else is just not worth the trip",5,0,0,Dimitri M.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,3,0

The waiter was rude, didn't explain us the prix-fixed and looked unhappy to answer our questions on the menu.We chose the prix-fixed menu ($30 for entree + dessert or appetizer + entree). The food was at best regular. We found lots of better places for eating in NYC for much less. The chicken with Malbec sauce was undercooked and the sauce was almost tasteless. The Bread Pudding was also boring, and costed $18. As dessert, we ordered a NYC cheesecake (hoping for a better food experience) but we got disappointed again. Too sweet and the cheesecake was pretty heavy.Finally, as we had a Jazz Dinner in a so-called Jazz Club, we expected good music.

4.0,4/3/2013,"Came here for the first time last weekend (3/30/13) to see the Frank Wess Quintet and enjoyed myself a lot. The place is small but I like small and quaint, as it gives a more personable experience. The food was pretty bland to me; I was there with my mother celebrating her best friend's birthday aka two women who are watching their diets for fear of health complications. We started off with buffalo wings, which they both went crazy about over the salt, I admit they were salty, but no complaints from me. They sent one platter back and tried the fried calamari which they said was great. For entrée's, I had a burger which was great except, I asked for it to be made well done and still had a lot of pink in my burger. I'm not picky so I moved on and ate what I could. My mother and her friend had the seared salmon with baby clams and sausage, which I thought was ok; the combination was odd to me and they both thought it was ok, not great, bland, but ok. The highlight of our visit was their drinks (The pink lemonade, so good!) and the service. Aside from the food, which I think is tailored to a certain palette, the service is impeccable. From the Maitre'd to our server, I was satisfied with the service. Our server Lindsey accommodated us greatly, even bringing the birthday woman a special candle lit dessert of her choice.  The show was short but superb and I really enjoyed myself.

The acoustics in this place are great and allow you to truly appreciate the music.Tip: Come here on a weeknight.  I mean, paying a cover charge is worth it, but why bother when you can enter for free??We also opted not to do the prix-fix dinner option ($30), and dropped by after dinner for drinks for the 9:00pm set.

A total rip off. 4 of us at a table added $140.00 to the already overpriced bill with rude service. Not to mention what people like to call ""intimate"" I call ""packed in like a sardine"".

We had to squeeze around and maneuver a bit, but hey, its New York. There is a minimum on how much you have to spend, but it's not so crazy.  If you order two drinks, or an entree, you should be fine.  I got their drinks, which were actually quite strong yet delicious!  Also the food looked really yummy, and they honored their free dessert check-in deal!  They five of us split a cheesecake :)The music is so much fun, and the whole vibe is relaxed and sophisticated.  The music definitely appeals to a wide range of audience, and the singer had a gorgeous voice.  he did some classic jazz covers, but also played songs from his own band. The guitarist and drummer were also amazingly talented!  Some of the songs can get a little cliche, and there was a bit of an Al Green ""let's get it on"" vibe going on, but it's great if you are on a date :) There were lots of couples on dates here, but also just groups of friends having fun, and some elderly guests too.  Apparently, This place appeals to everyone! Once the music starts, it's a bit hard to get the waiter's attention since they usually stand on the side when the music is playing, and also you have to practically shout in their ear so that they can hear what you need.  But they are really good at moving around in small spaces!  I was impressed. Also, I wouldn't recommend taking people you don't really know here, since once the music starts you can't have a conversation at all.  Unless you hate conversing with the people you are with.. then this is the perfect place to go!Overall, I really love this space!  It's something really different and fun for a night out, and great music is almost guaranteed!  And although you can't get up and dance, which is what I usually love to do, it's a nice place for a rather unique/inexpensive experience!",2,0,1,Stephanie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,368,31

4.0,4/6/2012,"I was fortunate enough to try this place on a weekend for brunch during one of the live shows.  The lady performing was a spectacular singer and it was a great experience!  This place is best if you want a cozy entertainment setting.  It's not a place to catch up with old friends over brunch.  The restaurant has a great vibe to it.  I would rate the ambiance a 5/5.Since there was a performance at the same time as us ordering, it was difficult to get the attention of the waitress in order to give in our order.  Since that's expected, I can't really complain about the service.  As for the food...I ordered a vegetarian omelet, but requested that they give egg whites instead.  The tater tots and salad that came with the omelet was delicious, but the omelet itself was bland and oily (which kind of defeats the purpose of ordering egg whites in the first place!).  I also tried the french toast with the banana fosters sauce -- it was amazing!  Very rich/heavy, but a smooth flavor.  We had a dark chocolate mousse for dessert (Yelp deal to get a free dessert with purchase!).  The dessert was delicious!The only real complaint I would have is that the restaurant had some trouble with splitting the check properly.  The amounts showing up on the individual four receipts added up to more than the original bill.  The issue was resolved with the help of the manager, and everything was fine.  I would definitely recommend coming in time for one of the shows!",0,1,0,Sheena V.,"Nashville, TN",245,145,31

The food is tasty and the servers are attentive. The only thing keeping Smoke from a perfect five star rating is the touch of pretension in the air: some people were there for music and dinner; others were there because they wanted to impress those who were there for music and dinner. Furthermore, the traditional romantic vibe (ie., candles, tiny tables, etc.) discourages people from ""letting loose"" and consequently feels a smidgeon stifling.

We had the best seats in the house because we were the first to show up. The show lasts an hour and there are not much options on the menu for food but for drinks there are a lot of pages. Come on Thursdays, I overheard one of the players on this day was nominated an oscar award.  Appetizers:Roasted Corn Soup- Creamy corn soup. Nothing fab. Crostini- YUMMY!!! Little pearl onions that keep dropping from the crostini when I take a bite along with the peas. Nice mixture of flavors with crunch!Entrees:Black Truffle Coq Au Vin-We ordered this dish to have the mash potatoes, veggies and the sauce. The mash potatoes were the soft crushed type and we mixed the veggies and sauce with our rice dish b/c it was too boring to us. The chicken fed my dog and stray cats and they loved it. =pHand Cut Semolina Pasta-It reminded me of lasagna. This dish was dry and boring too. Vegetarian Spring Risotto - Mushrooms does wonders to a dish. Again, we were not so happy with the flavors so we added the veggies and sauce from the chicken dish. It did not have a creamy consistency like it was suppose to. Dessert:Fresh Berry Shortcake-First time I had shortcake and I wasn't so impressed by it. The serving was not proportional. The cake overpowered the filling. Peach Upside down cake- First time I had this too and I enjoyed it. But after having a few more bites, it tasted sickening. The show was good but the food was not.

4.0,7/25/2011,"I used my trusty yelp app to guide us to this gem! Since our hotel was right by this place and the Mr loves him some Jazz, we decided to give this place a go! The place was small yet has a sultry and romantic feel to it. When you walk in, there is a bar to your left and to the right there is seating. Booths and tables. They can pretty much accompany any size party (between 2-10 I'd assume) There is a small stage where they have live Jazz bands and singers perform each night.We decided have a late dinner there as well. As for the food it wasn't too bad. We ordered the heirloom tomato salad, roasted corn soup and black truffle coq au vin. I like that this place uses organic or local ingredients as much as they can. Okay back to the food. The heirloom tomato salad had too many croutons. Since the description didn't mention that it had crouton's, the Mr. was a little disappointed. The roasted corn soup had a nice light flavor that didn't feel too heavy. If you like corn, this soup is for you! I slurped it right up along with my wine! The Coq au vin was very delicious. I loved the variety of flavors in this dish. The chicken was very moist but my only complaint is it was a bit bland. I was expecting more flavor from something so moist. But overall I tore that thing UP! LOL The quartet that was playing that night was pretty good. The singer Eve or Eva, she was great! The Mr was singing and groovin in his seat all night I had to quiet him down a few times!

First of all, the music was great, very lively, interactive, and had moments of impromptu greatness. The musicians were all friendly and really enjoyed what they do. The venue itself is small, which I consider a bonus for a jazz venue. Although the pole in front of the stage is somewhat of a hindrance. I expected great music, but the good food was actually surprising. I stuck to pretty basic stuff (maybe why I thought everything was good). Started with the organic house salad (hard to mess that up), then I had the coq au vin. The entree was very well flavored and the chicken was very tender and fell off the bone easily.

After a dreary, rainy day inside the office, it was quite nice to be enveloped in a lushly dark and velvety jazz spot.   We were lucky walk-ins who quickly discovered that it's wise to get reservations because the joint quickly filled up for the 7pm jazz set. There was no cover charge, but I believe you have to spend a minimum of $20 per person, which is quite reasonable. I had a nice Napa syrah ($9) and a coq au vin (less than $25?). There is a prix fixe menu that includes a dessert for $29 but that would've been too much food for me.Service was fantastic.

4.0,3/27/2011,"A romantic & charming find in an unlikely neighborhood.  The brunch here is fantastic!  Prices are very reasonable for what was just simply amazing food.  Definitely order the yogurt & granola -- it''s just heavenly and must be laced with an amazing drug --  the granola is chewy, sweet, smoky & homemade, the clover honey flavorful, and the fruit just perfect.  The spanish benedict -- poached eggs on chorizo & roasted fingerling potatoes with hollandaise -- was creamy, rich, and yummy, but still could've used an english muffin in there (my personal preference).  The oatmeal came with fruit, honey, & raisins, and was out of this world -- I mean, especially amazing considering it's just oatmeal.  The only thing lacking was the coffee, which tasted disappointingly watered down.The setting is like a true jazz-bar.  A small cramped stage is set off to the back, very much like in the Village Vanguard. Old woods, dark red velvet, crystal chandeliers, and pressed tin ceilings adorned the place.  There is wonderful live jazz with no cover for the Sat-Sun brunches -- and I mean real jazz, not the cheesy stuff you find in most restaurant establishments.  The place gets rowdy at night, with more focus on the jazz than the food or drink.  Definitely a good place for a date.  Although the brunch is good, the crowd is of course moreso for the mid-30s thru 50s type despite the restaurant's vicinity to Columbia.  I would recommend this place for a wonderfully charming Sunday afternoon.",0,0,0,yuwi s.,"New York, NY",7,133,2
2.0,3/7/2011,"I made a 9:30 reservation for my husband and arrived with two minutes to spare, and they found our name on the list. But for some reason, we were asked to wait in the cold line outside. A minute later, we were sat at our table. So no big deal. I think there was just some initial confusion.We waited at our table, and waited, and waited. 9:50, our waitress arrives to help the table next to us. The man orders his date a drink and asks if she could replace a cheese stuffed olive he had tragically dropped 15 minutes before. Then asks that she help us; I guess he had seen us waiting and was trying to be thoughtful. Instead of apologizing for having us wait for 20 minutes, she tells him, ""I was just about to take their drink order"" with that fake-smiley ""I KNOW"" attitude. I've been a waitress. I've made mistakes. A person should own up to a 20 minute wait. We order a bottle of wine and ask for water as well...........ten more minutes go by. I actually ask my husband if he wants to leave and go eat at Toast next door. (We'd seen a few empty tables on our walk over). I'm starting to become embarrassed for picking this spot for his special birthday dinner. While waiting for our drink to arrive, he notices a card on the table that says the entertainment charge for the evening is $35. That's kinda pricey, but I'm a musician, so that's fine. I appreciate the arts. The waitress shows up with our bottle of red at 10PM and takes our order. Husband gets the burger with cheese and the side oven fries, I get the salmon with baby potatoes. 10:20 we get our food. I can't believe what I see. My husband's burger looks great, but the oven fries are not oven fries; they are definitely kettle chips and only 12 of them. Also, his cheese (extra charge of $2.50) is a white cream sauce. I manage to bring our waitress over and she confirms that the cheese is a slice of cheddar but in a white-runny-form. When I further press that his burger was supposed to arrive with oven fries, not kettle chips, she states that those are Smoke's version of oven fries. It looks like they just got creative because they were low on potatoes or something. Let's look at my salmon ($26).....first of all, it is supposed to come with cockles, baby potatoes, and melted leeks. I see a 2.25 inch by 2.25 inch piece of salmon with VERY BABY POTATOES. So baby, that they might not even exist. I counted 6 leek coins and 6 BABY potato coins. That equals three baby potatoes that were cut in half that are the size of my thumb nail. My husband offers me a bite of his burger (which is really tasty) seeing the size of my meal. While the salmon is fresh, I'm not getting my socks knocked off by the taste. The good news about our small meals is that there's room for dessert. We order the wine infused pear shortcake-like item. What comes out is very humorous at this point: two cold sugar cookies sandwiching three red pear slices with some whipped cream. I thought that this was under fine dining. If we're covering the music charges, why does it seem like the food is suffering under these menu prices?All the while, the band was playing 5 songs. Scatting about, having a good time. I'm happy to be watching them. They are really good. But then the trombone player says they don't want to burden us their presence much longer. I think to myself, I see about 25 tables here paying $35 a pop. You're good, and to be entertained is no burden. We get the bill. Without tip, $199. I think about what we had and see the culprit. The music charge is $35 PER PERSON. I look at the card on the table and it only says that the music charge for the evening is $35. Every table is a table for two and we had wrongly assumed that it was $35 per table. Was the band good? Yes. They were good. Are they worth $70? I paid less for Ray LaMontagne tickets. Also, they didn't do what musicians should do. Play a bit over their time and appreciate the audience. I once played a five hour set with no breaks because the audience loved our band that much. Would I do that all the time? No. But then again, I wasn't getting paid half as much. It's not like they left right away after their set. I think my favorite part of the night were the incredible people sitting around our table. While the setting is intimate, it was fun getting to know the neighboring tables and laugh with them. My husband and I laughed about this night with our friends at the birthday-party I threw him the next evening, so we like to think of it as our ""$200 + Tip"" joke. Bottom line - if you are paying $200 + 15-20% tip at the end of the night for two people, the experience and food should leave a good feeling in your gut. At the very least, your gut should be full. I award them a star for the ambiance and a star for the band. I can't award a star for the service, the food/menu, or the over all experience. If we go back, it will only be for drinks and music on a night that costs less than $35 per person up front.",10,3,1,Sarah E.,"New York, NY",62,109,95

4.0,6/29/2010,"If you don't mind spending a pretty decent penny this is a great place to spend an evening. I deducted a star because the stage, along with the seating area is a bit cramped. The worst part being that there is a huge column blocking your view of the artists. It also doesn't help that the single restroom in the place is right between the stage and bar.What earned this venue four stars is the organization they showed at the door, which got everyone with a reservation a seat in their preferred location and the show started on-time. Although you are seated fairly close to your neighbor you do not feel them encroaching on your personal space. Lastly, the ambiance of the room and volume of the music set the perfect note and tone for the evening. The music was incredible, and speaking to more regular visitors the featured talent is always this good.I took my dad here for father's day. I cannot comment on the food because we had dinner somewhere else. I was disappointed that a $30 cover charge did not excuse us from the $10 minimum you have to spend in the restaurant, but we were going to have drinks anyway.

5.0,6/15/2010,"I can't say enough great things about this place. My husband brought me here for a surprise on a random Monday night once, and we caught the ""open mic night"" type of event they have there. There was no cover to get in, but there was a $20 food/drink minimum. We ended up splitting one order of the prix-fixe menu, selecting the shrimp and grits, the scallops, and the fruit tart. (All of these appear on the regular menu too.)  OMG. Scallops. Amazing. The shrimp was incredibly flavorful as well. Probably the best meal we'd had together in a long time - and generous enough portions that we were able to comfortably split everything. Beyond all that, however -- the atmosphere at Smoke is just wonderful. It's small, dark, and cozy: perfect for a jazz lounge. The music, even on the open mic night, was great. The only potential drawback was that it was difficult to talk or hear each other during the loud swells in the music, even seated in the back, but if you're enjoying the music you probably wouldn't mind too much.",0,0,0,S.

I recall this location used to be called the Augie's and it was frequented mostly by the Columbia students. in 1999 current owners Paul and Frank took over the place and converted to be what it is now, a Supper Club with outstanding music and with the recent arrival of well-known chef Patricia Williams, exceptional food.It is located in a mid-block between 105th and 106th on Broadway so easy to miss. Once inside there is a full length bar take the left side of the space and the right side offers about twenty or so table for diners. There is a small stage at the far end of the room. ( it is small but they still manage to fit 16 piece jazz band on Thursday nights.Their music calendar is full top class jazz bands seven days a week. Saturdays and Sundays they also have jazz brunch with no music charge (normal music cover charge is $9). Tables are small and the seating is tight but somehow you don't mind it when great food and music get together.Chef Patricia Williams, formerly of Butterfield 81, Morrels, District and Nios revamped the menu and added some amazing seasonal dishes to both dinner and brunch menus.They no longer take dinner reservations but instead you buy your tickets for the music and you specify if you want dining room or bar seating.It's now one of my new favorite places in NYC.",3,0,0,Sebastian S.,"New York, NY",88,103,248
3.0,12/14/2009,"As I'm completely ignorant regarding jazz, I'm not going to discuss the quality of music at all other than simply saying that to my uneducated ears, the band was good and I enjoyed it. Accordingly, the three stars refers to everything except the music itself.Smoke has a cool atmosphere. It is very intimate, which is a plus, without feeling crowded. Of course, the night I was there it wasn't completely full, so it might feel cramped if there were a lot of people there. Because it's small, most of the seats are quite choice, but there is a pole on one side of the stage, obscuring my view of some of the performers. I felt the food was actually quite solid. Nothing crazy, nothing you'd go out of your way to eat, but good. It isn't going to distract you from enjoying the music and that is a positive thing. I had the Pepsi short ribs. Definitely flavorful, but perhaps a bit tough, especially compared to expertly-done short ribs.Because it's such a small place, you have to stay quiet, which is fine. This led to a pretty funny moment when an obnoxiously blond girl basically stood in front of the stage and yelled to a friend sitting at a nearby table in the fashion that you might yell to talk over the music in a club. Difference is, in this club, everyone (other than her, I guess) is there to hear the music. She was promptly and brutally ""shushed."" Hysterical. She then settled in to checking her blackberry right in front of the stage. Classy.So, I'd hit up Smoke if you're a jazz fan or would like to become a jazz fan.  It's a good time and clearly the focus of the place.

It's a dimly lit room with many small tables all connected as well as a bar with stools. The waiter was young and really nice.

4.0,5/23/2006,"During the week (Sun-Thur) there is a $15 drink minimum, but no cover.  The jazz is pretty good.  The venue is small, but intimate and the sound is good.  $12 for a Beefeater martini (and the olives are excellent) is fair.  Sets at 9, 11 and 12.30.  I avoid it on the weekends (big cover, and it's not really better than the weeknights) but during the week, it's a nice night out.  Definitely a good date.I was there tonight, and they were recording a live CD, so the band was on their game, it was some spectacular music.",2,0,1,Jonathan C.,"New York, NY",5,41,0
1.0,4/17/2006,"Avoid Smoke if you are looking for either a comfortable place to relax (the seating layout is awful) or good jazz (the quality of performances is frankly among the worst in the city).   That being said, I still visit Smoke every once in a while, as it is the only jazz club in my neighborhood.",3,0,0,John C.,"Manhattan, NY",8,21,0
5.0,2/14/2006,"I've been to a  bunch of jazz clubs in New York, and this is by far my favorite spot.  It's totally the kind of place where other musicians go to check each other out and hang.  It's a small place, with room for about 100 people and it's a ways uptown in Harlem.  There's isn't too much going on in the surrounding neighborhood, but on the flipside, it just means that only folks in the know will make the trip to Smoke.   The room has an intimate feel, with dark wood tables, antique chairs, cushy sofas, red velvet curtains, hanging chandeliers and candlelight flickering on the exposed brick walls.  Most importantly, the music is great and the sound in the room is excellent.  Unless there is a special event scheduled, there is no cover on weeknights (though I believe there is a drink minimum).  On weekends, expect the cover to be around $20-30 depending on how big the acts are.",0,0,1,Emily L.,"New York, NY",58,137,1
