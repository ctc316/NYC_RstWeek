We asked the hostess what she would recommend and she said that anything on the menu that contained meat or protein could be altered so we decided to try it out. We were seated right away. Very tight place. I ordered the salmon. It was good. Nice, crispy skin. Good flavors. Had an iced tea and was shocked that they charged $8 for a very small glass of iced tea.

We were seated right away and I had snagged that reservation that day. Walking into SOUTHGATE,  I was so amazed by the beautiful décor. Stunning mirror installations lined the walls behind some of the booths and the ceilings in the front of the restaurant.  The rest of the restaurant was tastefully done with modern furniture and an exquisite bar. Our waiter came right away and was very kind. From the restaurant week menu, I ordered the simple greens, roasted chicken and strawberry shortcake. The greens were very fresh and crispy, the perfect light salad. My chicken was cooked impeccably, just the right amount of moist inside and crispy skin. My friend ordered the salmon which was similarly prepared beautifully. The desserts were fabulous. Overall, it was a great dining experience.  The ambiance is one of the best in the city.

1.0,3/1/2018,"Sub par breakfast in a city full of fabulous food choices. Horrid service by a waiter with a vest on which he'd spilled his or someone else's breakfast. Food tasted rancid, breakfast potatoes in particular. Too nice and expensive a restaurant to then be presented with a day old store bought bagels and packets of Philadelphia cream cheese. The side of ""fruit"" was Lilliputian with white, flavorless pineapple. With all of the fruit carts outside, perhaps they can find a new vendor.

3.0,1/20/2018,"Nice enough place, though pretty empty. I like a quiet bar, though the spot was pretty dead, even for a Sunday. Maybe their usual crowd was in Aspen for the long weekend (read: cougar den.) We found two lounge chairs by the fireplace, and it wasn't too long (but not right away) before a waiter came to take our order. Wife had tea, I had a Manhattan - $25!! Granted, it was a fine drink, but $25 is bonkers. In addition, the waiter threw down my cocktail napkin with enough disdain that I thought I had cursed his mother or something. And no bar nuts. Sheesh!If I were staying at the Essex House again (we might), I would come back for a drink, if only b/c we liked the fireplace, the drink was tasty, and the cold was so damn frigid that night.

2.0,1/11/2018,"I stayed at the JW Marriott for 4 nights. I wouldn't have normally stayed at such a ""high end"" hotel and location as this, but it was booked for me.  Since we had per diem and we wanted to save our own money, we ate at the hotel's restaurant, the Southgate Bar & Restaurant, for all of those days. I really thought we could find one redeeming meal in the entire menu, but we were sorely disappointed.First off, the prices are almost comically overpriced. $9 for coffee? $18 for 3 mediocre deviled eggs? $16 for oatmeal with a skim layer of water floating on top? I know NY is expensive, but for the quality this is criminal.So why can a place that serves mediocre food charge this much? Because they just can. They have a nice location across from Central Park, they probably have some high rolling guests staying next door who are willing to spend the money (and who may never read this post), and they look like a really nice place (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1), but underneath it all is just sad, sad food. Don't be fooled by its looks, look elsewhere for a better expensive meal.

4.0,1/11/2018,We came to SOUTHGATE for a drink before a conference at Essex House. The staff was incredibly attentive and acknowledged us as soon as we arrived. We placed our order within minutes of sitting down at the bar and had complimentary candied nuts delivered to us by the waiter. The cocktails are beautiful and the wine list has good options. The atmosphere and coziness of SOUTHGATE make for a great escape from the city streets. The drinks and wine are around $16-$25 a piece depending on what wine/cocktail you order. There are also a great selection of small bites if you are looking to share - sliders and truffle fries were my favorite.,0,0,0,Anna G.,"Manhattan, NY",188,131,191
4.0,1/8/2018,"It is not always easy to find a restaurant that is open super early on weekends, that is more than a café. One good option is to look for a restaurant nestled inside a hotel, since most of them are open from early hours for their guests. And, most of the restaurants are open for public as well, you don't have to be staying at the hotel to be able to dine there. I found a restaurant inside JW Marriott Essex House New York, right across from the Central Park.The inside was really big, with high ceiling and lots of natural light coming in from their large windows that goes from floor to ceiling.Just like many hotel restaurants, they offer breakfast buffet. Our server told us that we can go take a look if we want, or we can order from their set menu. We went to take a peak at the buffet, but we decided to order from their breakfast menu instead.For food, we ordered Croque Madame, Brioche French Toast, and The Farmer's Omelet. We enjoyed the breakfast, it was super filling, the portion was really big which was surprising. We were all very stuffed and satisfied. Our server was great, he took a good care of us.

1.0,12/24/2017,"We are staying at the Essex House. With my partner feeling under the weather, we opted to just head to the lobby and have dinner here. The hostess was pleasant and sat us promptly. The back half of the restaurant was reserved for a private event - side note with this, I'm surprised management did not calm things down with their large family gathering. About 30 mins into our meal, it was disturbing to hear ""shot, shot, shot"" being screamed at the top of a man's lungs and another standing above them to take photos. The party was extremely wild for a restaurant who was still serving other guests. After being seated, a woman placed 2 menus down, saying nothing and walked off. She then asked if we'd like tap or bottled wafer and returned eventually with water. She walked off again, even though we were ready to order. We were really confused if she was our waitress or not. As she's cleaning the table next to us, I made eye contact with her and while wiping it down says in a snappy way, ""ya ready?"". I said yes, and she kept wiping the table then walked off to get her pad. Upon her return, with no smile she just said, ""what do you want?"". Our menus were snatched up and that was that. I was in shock at the unprofessionalism of this waitress, Misty. Several other inappropriate behaviors from a server occurred, but those were the biggest. The food is mediocre, at best, and incredibly overpriced. We shared between both our plates and shared the appetizer. Upon finishing, we both didn't feel well and I can only think it was the food. The burger tasted like it's soaked in Worcestershire sauce, giving it just a foul taste and extremely messy. A burger for $27 should be of quality meat and not need that nasty marinade. Salt + pepper on a top grade beef should be sufficient. Their meat clearly wasn't of quality. I noticed the woman next to me had a burger, too, but had removed the bun. They wrapped up their meal & left as we were eating. The waitress, Misty, commented about not eating the bun to the woman. The woman replied that she was surprised they would send out such a burnt bun. The waitress didnt even reply to that and walked off with the plate! Also, after being served the food, she didn't check up to see if everything came out correctly or if we needed anything until about 15 minutes after being served. For those 15 minutes, I had no beverage and needed a refill. My partner briefly left the table and I was seated facing the wall - where a huge projector was playing a football game. The waitress walked behind me, unknowingly to me, and stated ""everything find?"" I was startled and nodded as she walked off. So unprofessional to not even position yourself to face the customer to ask how the meal is! Neither my partner nor I had any specialty drinks - each had one of the less expensive entrees and split an appetizer. The cost of our dinner was just at $100. We would've been fine spending more than that, however $100 for terrible, unprofessional service from Misty and below average food is unacceptable. The 1 star is simply for the convenience of this being in the lobby of where we're spending our Holiday.",1,0,1,A B.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,27,3

Went to this restaurant with my father and father in law on Sunday at 1pm.  Figured that a restaurant within the Marriott should do well under those conditions... Boy were we wrong.  The restaurant was utterly empty. Besides our table, there was probably two other tables with 3 people.  Two waiters and a bus boy. Wanted a steak and eggs... ""Sorry, we don't have that""... Okay, how about an eggs Benedict?  ""No, sorry, we only have that with crab and can't make it different.""Let's try a different way, what salads do you have? ""Only one with mustard dressing.""30 minutes later, we got our food... You know, the simple ""eggs over easy with cheese on top""; nope, guess it wasn't that simple to write down that I wanted cheese.  Wait, let me try this again, all of us got the same eggs with cheese, but all of us didn't have any cheese.  Simple solution: write down the order instead of trying to remember it. Only reason this isn't getting 1 star is because of the jazz band. It was nice and would have made for a wonderful experience.

1.0,12/20/2015,"A truly dreadful experience.I went with my family for the Thanksgiving Day buffet. The price was steep ($125 per person, alcohol not included), but we've paid the same or more at other venues for fantastic brunches.The problem, however, is that this is no fantastic brunch. From the moment I walked into the dining room, without a hint of decoration, I knew there was going to be a problem. The restaurant was fairly empty, yet we were seated at a small, cramped table. Our waiter came by to offer us a complimentary ""welcome cocktail."" We asked what was in the beverage, as he didn't tell us what he was serving us and some people in our party didn't drink alcohol, and the waiter's response was ""I don't know, I just started my shift."" Lovely. The experience only went downhill from there.I won't bore you with the tedious details of the limited, sub-par food on offer, but the free breakfast buffet you get at any budget hotel is leaps and bounds better than this, both in terms of food quality and variety of offerings. The food here was stale, mushy, old, salty, and generally unappetizing.To add insult to injury, the manager at one point came by to ask how the meal was going, and we registered our disappointment. Instead of offering to make a bad situation a little bit better, all he did was offer to get us some ""free dessert."" By that I mean he was offering to give us some of the food from the buffet, the buffet for which we'd already paid $125. This place is truly an embarrassment to the Marriott name.

1.0,11/29/2015,"I was in New York for Thanksgiving with my family and somehow we made reservations to go to this establishment's ""Thanksgiving Grand Buffet"". It was $125 per person, with a welcome drink.Basically, as soon as I walked in the restaurant, my instinct was to leave the place. I should have followed my instinct. This was an expensive ""Grand Buffet"" for Thanksgiving. There was no Thanksgiving decor. I had no idea what the welcome drink would be. Approximately 5 minutes after we sat down, a server finally came over and brought us the drinks. When asked what it was (it was not champagne, which I would have expected), he said he didnt know, that he'd ""just gotten on shift"" so had to ask what it was. Not good. We went to he buffet. There was absolutely nothing ""Grand"" about it. It was in a small room, with not much food, all of low quality. The shellfish and shrimp sat in tired dishes in melting ice/ water. The carved turkey station was tired and the ""cranberry sauce"" did not resemble cranberry sauce in flavor in the least. Poor quality/ significantly overcooked vegetables. No seasonal desserts. Just a pathetic attempt with no effort whatsoever on their part to make this buffet ""Grand"" at all. The waiter brought rolls that were clearly old and stale. The Manager approached our table to ask how we were going and really did not at all know how to acknowledge our unhappiness. He seemed surprised and quickly ran away. Normally in a situation like this I'd try to have a few drinks to dull the pain. However, the prices were outrageous on all of the drinks and wines and I decided I didnt want to give any more money to this establishment. Before we left my partner approached the hostess to ask for a card with the manager's name. She tried to get the manager's attention but he saw it was us asking and just didnt pay attention. Not good. Look - this restaurant is in the JW Marriott Essex House Hotel. JW Marriott is the high end hotel of Marriott. This restaurant, in my opinion, couldn't even pass muster in the lowest of low roadside motels.

1.0,5/26/2014,"Irresponsible & negligent.This place presents itself as upscale, it's fairly pricy, but no more expensive than other places in this part of town. Decor is a little dated and they had a roaring open fire even though it was 80 degrees outside which was a little odd. They appear to have tried to update the menu to be a little more hipstery, which I didn't mind. What I did mind was biting into their lobster roll appetizer and after a few chews finding  a very large disc of solid lobster cartilage in my mouth. With no exaggeration, you would be hard pressed to engineer a more efficient choking device than this thing. After less than elegantly removing the piece of skeleton from my mouth I politely gestured to the waiter to come over. I pointed to the disc and told him that I'd almost choked on it. What happened next was quite surprising. Instead of the usual barrage of apologies the waiter said ""it's supposed to be there"", I was quite taken aback. ""This isn't a whole cooked lobster"" I said, ""It's a lobster roll, there shouldn't be anything inedible in there, it's dangerous, I could have choked on that"". He then proceeded to inform me that it was a new menu, other people have complained about it but the large disc of cartilage was intentionally meant to be there. I was totally lost for words. Needless to say, we did not continue on to our main course. I could only describe the experience as bizarre. What worries me is the nonchalant reaction of the waiter for an event that under his own admission is fairly common.

Our waitress never came to ask how it was, and when the busser came to clear it no one asked if there was anything wrong with the dish.The main course was okay - however again, Misty never stopped by to ask how things were or if we needed anything.

Then, IMMEDIATELY after the main course was cleared (by this time my water glass was also empty) our waitress delivered the check. We let her know we still hadn't received our dessert yet, to which she mumbled something blaming the bussers for clearing the table too quickly and disappeared again without refilling waters or asking how our food was, if we'd like another drink, etc.The dessert was actually quite good (although I guess its difficult to get fondue wrong)  and immediately when we finished, Misty reappeared with the check for a second time. Again, didn't ask us how our meal was or even wish us a happy Valentines day. Oh, and the kicker? The 20% gratuity was already included in our check. Maybe that's why she felt absolutely no compulsion to provide ANY service. We literally saw her 3 times throughout the meal - once to take our orders and twice to deliver our bill. Not sure if this is standard treatment at South Gate (I'm hoping not based on the other reviews) but I'm so appalled at how we were treated, we won't be back. The food was so so, and the service was atrocious. If this isn't typical, someone should speak with Misty about the definition of service - especially when your patrons are forking over more than $200 bucks for a meal.",4,1,0,Melissa M.,"New York, NY",43,58,0
4.0,12/29/2012,"South Gate is super posh and my pick for an artisan cocktail with girlfriends after work. Notice I said ""a"" cocktail -- they're worth it but pricey, at around $15 each. My favorite is the Rosemary Pear Bramble, which is pear vodka-based with rosemary and lemon.The menu is excellent but again a major splurge. Apps are around $15 and entrees are about $30+. The bucatini with crab, cod, and thai spices might strike you as a strange combination but it's amazing.What South Gate is missing is consistently amazing service. I've had nights where they handled everything seamlessly, and others where an item was mistakenly added to my bill, or I had to ask more than once for another glass of wine.",2,0,0,Kate T.,"New York, NY",78,428,8

The first time I went was a few months ago.  The service wasn't good the first time but I thought I would try it again.  Unfortunately the service was AWFUL the second time as well.How hard is it to pour a glass of wine.  I ordered a glass of wine and a glass of water.  They didn't have the wine I ordered and the waiter was going to give me something else that he thought was comparable, but the fact that I waited 10 mins to get waited on to begin with I was concerned that it would take awhile before he came back so I ordered something else.I never got my water and after I got my wine no one ever came back to ask if I wanted something else.  At the same time a women and her son came to the bar to order coffee, because they were waiting at a table for while and never got waited on.So I got my check ($19) for a glass of wine.  I left $20.  I am sure the waiter thinks I am cheap because he would never think that he was awful and didn't deserve a tip.  Needless to say that will be the last time I go to Southgate.  Two strikes.",0,0,0,Peggy S.,"Charleston, SC",0,10,0
4.0,9/11/2012,"Visited the restaurant because it was convenient.It was late at night, and we didn't wanna go too far because we were tired from walking around all day. This just happened to be right downstairs in our hotel (Jumeirah Essex House) so we made our way to dinner here.The food was pretty good. I ordered the foie gras, veal chop, and dessert and my girlfriend had the mushroom gnocchi. Not a bad dinner. The desserts (chocolate mousse and cheescake) were not bad, either.One thing that I would recommend for the restaurant is to train the serve staff. The server that brought out the food from the kitchen had no idea where he was going. He even set food down in front of my girlfriend and me that was supposed to go to the table next to us. The guy seemed plain lost throughout the entire night.The cool thing was that the restaurant had its wine list on an iPad! Not the easiest way to search the wine list, but I thought it was quite innovative and could work with a few minor tweaks here and there.Overall, a very good dinner.

4.0,7/30/2012,"On my two visits to South Gate, the food has exceeded expectations for a hotel restaurant. Yes, I know that hotels are investing more in fine dining, but too often they still disappoint. South Gate, however, offers great ingredients cooked with finesse.The atmosphere is lovely with soaring ceilings, shiny surfaces, walls of wine bottles and sweeping views of the south side of Central Park - hence the name. It's relaxing to watch the carriages waiting for their next fare across the street. The restaurant itself is starting to show some wear and tear, but it's maintained well. Service is highly professional and accommodating.The recent Restaurant Week menu (available at other times as the Market Menu) was both satisfying and a real bargain at $24.07. I began with a salad of cream stuffed burrata, pea tendrils and finely shredded snow peas. My dining companion had the charred octopus salad, which was equally interesting. We both chose the salmon entree - cooked medium rare over curried rice pilaf with roasted multi-color cauliflower florets. Between the two courses, we met our vegetable requirements for the whole day.Dessert was an adroit chocolate terrine with hazelnut ice cream and crunchy feuilletine. I recommend South Gate for lunch and as a place to entertain out of town guests, who will love the views AND the food.",0,0,0,Irene S.,"New York, NY",14,79,26

In retrospect, I always wonder if I made I made the right choices when ordering... there is something about the place that always make me feel guilty whenever I order from the Lunch Market Menu or Pre-Theater Menus, because it's such a deal and quite appetizing. Of course, I've ordered from their regular menu as well- the Butter Poached Lobster, House Smoked Duck Breast and Dry Aged Sirloin are amongst my favorite entrees for dinner and their Burger is a lunch favorite. Another favorite is to sit with a drink on one of their comfortable couches with friends.

The service was excellent. Remembering all that we went there again on a Sunday in June, this year.The place was still nice and not crowded. But the food must have been cooked by a different crew than in 2009. The appetizers - burrata and grilled asparagus crostini were way overcooked and bland. The halibut and salmon were both dried out and the sides salty while still being bland.

3.0,3/31/2012,"I'm not sure why the restaurant is referred to as 'upscale'  I think the decor has a very modern and attractive decor, and the ambience is possibly described as nicer casual (pics are available on the website).  The prices are possibly reflective of somewhat upscale restaurants, and the food is probably more reflective of something churned out when one orders room service in a moderately decent hotel (in this case the Jumeirah), as opposed to haute cuisine one might expect from the talented chef proudly named on the menu.Wine: The highlight of the evening was a delectable bottle of chambolle-musigny 1994 that my cousin picked from the menu.  It was absolutely delicious, and kudos to the sommelier or wine buyer that stocks their restaurant.Food: I think their $35 pre-theatre menu is a good deal.  If you want a better meal, pick a better restaurant.  The short ribs were excellent, but the mustard greens that accompanied them were blanched to an inedible pulp so my guests could not eat it (you'd love it only if you were a cow.. literally!)  and I could not have more than a couple of bites of the grilled salmon, which seemed dull, dry and un-flavourful from no seasoning and from overcooking (I requested medium-rare).  It was accompanied by a basmati cooked to seemingly emulate a flavored varietal of 'uncle bens rice'.  I requested an alternative from the waiter, and as it was accompanied by an indignant look and comment from the waiter, I offered to share some thoughts with the chef on how to season and correctly prepare a beautiful piece of fish (he never arrived).  The alternative which arrived after my guests completed their meals was a well prepared cornish hen, although over salted: mixed reviews on the food in general.Service: I recommend that they train them well before unleashing them on customers.  Its only fair to that individual waiting tables and the customer, as the expectations are high in that setting.  Muttering, 'oh you would like to have number xx77x' on the menu when I requested the Chambolle-Musigny and his indignant  reaction to my thoughts of the food were quite a strange experience for me as I did not expect that from a restaurant of that calibre.Dessert:  Delectable.  Keep it up !Water: The New York Water is alway excellent of course ! :-)Overall: 3 stars, and thats generous.  I had excellent company, so that made my evening a fantastic one..  You might have more of a hit or miss experience based on the reviews below",0,0,0,Leroy R.,"San Francisco, CA",8,17,0

4.0,2/23/2012,"Post-opera grub can be hard to find, especially on a Wednesday night. It was just minutes after 11PM and we were feeling a little too glamorous for Rosa Mexicana or P.J. Clarke's; Marea had just closed. It was such a pleasant evening we kept strolling east on Central Park South, and we swung into South Gate for a snack and a drink.It is perfectly posh and predictably spendy, as hotel bars are. At $12 a glass, Carménère is the cheapest red wine on the list; if you hanker for champers, Louis Roederer is $19 a glass. For my first round I had Junipero gin and Tomm's homemade tonic (the only cocktail on the list that seemed vaguely worth the $16, i.e. that I couldn't just make at home). The tonic was very nice, if a bit sweet. We ordered the grilled chicken salad (chicken was freshly grilled all right, and the mixed greens were pretty awesome, which they'd better be for $19. Cheese and avocado balanced it all out nicely, but there wasn't enough pancetta for it to have been mentioned on the menu description), the tuna tacos (more avocado, which is always good in my world, julienned radish and a crispy taco shell, $18) and the crab croquettes (a pretty portion of tot-sized fritters, served in a stemless cocktail glass on a bed of tasty fried onions, with a side of delicious grainy mustard for dipping). The savory food is divided into ""bites"" and ""fork and knife.""Our server was charming and hospitable, with a sense of humor. However, he neglected to tell us that it was last call for dessert. He claimed no one ever ordered it. I suppose he had no way of knowing about my dessert THING. But he caught on quickly: sensing I might lose it, he scurried off and procured a cheesecake from room service (coconut ice cream, whipped cream, berries). I would have preferred a chocolate pot de creme, but it was a nice gesture. He did charge us for an order of sorbet; I forgave him for charging us for something we didn't really order, since we did finish the cheesecake, after all.They have super fancy Cognac and Scotch options, if that's your thing. Good luck trying to find something reasonably priced to sip with your dessert. I opted for Ardbeg 10 year single malt Scotch, $16.It was a lovely room to while away an hour or two, with sexy lighting and big picture windows to admire the Park after dark, gorgeous flower arrangements (orchids and huge magnolia branches on this particular night) one of those fancy fake fireplaces, and a luxurious powder room three times the size of many an East Village dwelling.

4.0,2/17/2012,"My date for Valentine's Day indicated that he had booked a table here for dinner.  I must admit, I was pretty skeptical of this restaurant because I had never heard of it before, and I'm out and about A LOT.  However, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  First, I agree with the couple previous reviews that the door is very heavy.  It's kind of funny, I totally forgot about that fact until I read the reviews!  LOL!  There are two doors one and then another to get in and maybe there's some sort of backdraft going on in there, but I remember having to push really hard on both doors to get in.  And, it's a little nerve wracking for someone like myself because it's clear all the way through, so people could be staring at you as you walk in.  Although, that's probably just me being paranoid.  That said, the place is gorgeous and pretty romantic.  The bar was beautiful and we got some great seats facing the park.  The bartender was super sweet and attentive, but the drinks I don't think were very strong, but I'm a drinker.  LOL!  We were seated at a table, practially on top of another couple, and my date politely asked to be moved over to the next table over which was empty and on the end.  The hostess was actually quite rude and acted like that would be too much of a burden.  She said that the other table had not been ""set"" yet and this one was.  WHAT?  Luckily, that very minute, what appeared to be the sommelier, but could have just been a manager or something, passed by and said that it would be no problem, just give him a minute.  The hostess then asked us to go back to the bar, which was very odd, since the bar was a great distance from the table and it literally took two seconds to transfer everything over to the table next to it.  Even the bartender asked ""what the heck is going on?""  Next, although the wine list was extensive, the wine that we ended up getting was not that great, and it was expensive.  No one minds expensive as long as it was fantastic, but it wasn't.  It was a brunello di Montalcino, which is usually an excellent wine.  It did sort of open up as the night went on, either that or the drinks were just starting to kick in.  And, I agree with the previous posts that the bread they brought out was just okay.  Anyway, we ordered off of their Valentine's menu.  The spinach ravioli were absolutely amazing, as was the short ribs entree.  Between the atmosphere and those two gems, I'm giving this place four stars.  The dessert was just okay.  We did the chocolate experience for two and were not impressed.  It actually wasn't even good.  The espresso was, though.  At the end of the night, my date had to ask the hostess for a rose, which I guess was complimentary with dinner.  She should have been handing those out left right and center.  And, just FYI, dinner for two was over $400, closer to $500, so bring your wallet.  Sure, it was Valentine's Day and we ordered an expensive (but just average tasting) bottle of wine, but that's a little steep in my opinion.  Of course, I wasn't paying, but whatever, it seemed a little steep to me.",0,0,0,Angela N.,"Orlando, FL",2,50,0

4.0,10/6/2011,"South Gate, without a doubt, is probably one of the defining pleasures of Jumeirah Essex House. In fact, I found myself sitting at its lavish bar each evening before heading up to my room. So what makes South Gate so special?First, the bar/restaurant is located on Central Park S., a perfect location that is far enough away from the late night throngs of cattle that meander aimlessly a few blocks down. The space gives one a sense of seclusion, but not one that makes you forget that you're in the greatest, liveliest city on earth. It's an oasis, really. More importantly, however, is the welcoming, hospitable bar staff. Over a span of four or five days, my entourage and I established a fun, personable rapport with bartenders Peter and Mickey. Not only can they pour some mean, well-mixed drinks, but they are what gives South Gate its charming personality. There's no need at all to walk down to Times Square if on a quest for entertainment because Mickey and Peter are experts at hilarity. Their off-the-cuff one-liners are impressive, and watching Mickey dance, albeit to the requests of the bar's patrons, was priceless. In addition, I met some fantastic people while sipping on my vodka pineapple cocktails and glasses of sauvignon blanc. Making friends with a Scottish father and son  visiting NYC for the U.S. Open was a highlight of my trip, and meeting them each evening for drinks was a pleasure. The pricing for drinks is commensurate for what one would find in an upscale hotel bar. Thinking more about it, the pricing may actually be rather reasonable. If you are in search of a more quiet, relaxed and upscale setting to wind down, I highly recommend that you consider South Gate. I will defintely be returning (likely in December).",5,5,5,Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",826,721,1896

2.0,8/26/2011,"South Gate is a very fancy place.* The decorations are lavish, the ceilings are high. It's location in a hotel on the edge of Central Park lends it a grand air, one of excellence and yes, expense. Unfortunately, the evening we walked in, South Gate seemed to be devoted to some sort of corporate happy hour, and everything else seemed to fall by the wayside. To be clear, by ""everything else,"" I mean service, food, and general courtesy.From the outset, our waiter seemed upset that we had been seated in his otherwise empty section. He answered our questions almost grudgingly, and was only able to recommend the most expensive items without any elaboration. As the meal progressed, we did a lot of sitting and waiting (to order, for drinks, to order, for food, for our check...) and the staff did a lot of standing around. It's not as if they were busy; the dining room was essentially empty, although many of the tables seemed to be occupied by the jackets and purses of the people loudly congregating at the bar. However, I was still forced to beg for water refills when I was able to catch someone's eye. They did seem to be available to ask if we needed another cocktail (her Stork Club, which was far too sweet, and my martini, which was excellent). But you know what? I don't need to be coddled. Any and all of these transgressions would have been forgivable as long as the food was good. And it seemed promising, at first. We were brought some complimentary gougeres and a bit of potato salad to start (much appreciated). And both were very tasty, as was the summer risotto that we chose as a starter. But the entrees were just so overwhelmingly disappointing. Well, despite being served with shockingly flavorless orbs of potato, her fish was decent enough. Or perhaps it just seemed so when compared to my hanger steak. Although this piece of beef was cooked correctly to medium rare, it was actually -- and I don't say this lightly -- terrible. Served atop a huge pile of jicama, the small portion was cold, chewy, and I hate to say it, but the underseasoned meat actually tasted a bit off. I can't recall the last time I felt so let down by a meal I had anticipated so excitedly; it was just such an unsatisfying plate of food. Perhaps I should have said something to our waiter...but it's not as if it was incorrectly cooked. How do you tell someone that the food they had just served you was simply...bad?I realize that at $28, the hanger steak is one of the cheaper entrees. Perhaps I would've been more pleased with the filet mignon, or the veal chop I had been considering. But I liked the sound of the chimichurri, and a restaurant of this supposed caliber should still execute the slightly less expensive items. I feel for more expensive establishments, because the more people spend, the higher their expectations. And that must be difficult to live up to on a regular basis. But I have to believe that I would have been unhappy with both the service and this hanger steak at any price point.

4.0,8/19/2011,"There are those places in NYC that really hammer home the point that you're in the epicenter of the universe, and South Gate is one of them. Immediately upon walking in the prestigious Central Park South entrance, you're keenly aware that South Gate has been the backdrop for deals that have moved markets as well as budding romances that ended in multi-million dollar front page divorces. Wonderfully open space, high ceilings, and a magnetic bar that was clearly the place to be on this particular evening (and for most evenings, I'd expect.) The service is experienced, attentive, and for the most part warmer than you'd anticipate...with a few requisite grizzled/uppity service industry veterans mixed in. At the bar, you'll get a dish of the most delectable honey glazed nuts along with your $15 Grey Goose and club. The assorted meat plate (5 for $16) was a generous serving of artery clogging deliciousness. The cheese list (5 for $15) looked equally appealing, especially paired with their seemingly endless selection of wine. The South Gate should be added to your list of venues to take your important clients, that special someone, or to cap off your out-of-town NYC experience with a luxury cocktail.",1,0,1,Dominick Q.,"Manhattan, NY",611,194,39

3.0,8/8/2011,"Very atmospheric modern restaurant with a well crafted menu and wine list.  Have been here multiple times and the service generally leaves a little to be desired.  Waiters often take a while to show up.  Then they seem to have issues explaining the menu.  The cheese puffs are a nice starting touch but they proceed to whip them away as if needing to be rationed.  The wine list on the I-pad is an interesting novelty and the sommelier is perhaps the most polished aspect of the service.  Otherwise, it's often a comedy of errors not worth recounting in detail but nevertheless sufficient to marr the overall experience.  The food is fairly consistent but on certain occasions has suffered from over or under seasoning.  Breakfast here is the most stable and reliable experience.  Dinner tends to be rather hit or miss regretably.",0,0,0,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",20,24,0

Leather seats, marble floors, glass walls, a fire place and an abounding collection of wine presented beautifully along their back wall. As the famous Jumeirah Hotel's restaurant and bar, South Gate speaks for itself. Executive chef Kerry Heffernan brings 20 years of experience in South gate, and successfully shows his talents and creativity in his delicious but yet simple menu. My wife and I went with their Summer Restaurant week menu. It contained a good variety of dishes that ranged from seafood to meat and everything in between. We started with the sweet corn clam chowder and the salmon tartare. The chowder I have to say was too salty for me, it was way overpowering and I had to accompany the dish with 4 pieces of bread to even things out a little. The Salmon taretar however was just a bite or bites of perfection. It had a hint of ginger that was not too intense that it covered the flavors of the salmon but just right. For mains we ordered the roasted chicken and grilled salmon. The chicken was a bit on the dry side but seasoned well and went well with the Yukon potatoes and veggies. The salmon kinda surprised me with the large portion size, it was a good thing too because we would get to enjoy more of it. The salmon was made medium so just in case some of you prefer well done, you gotta let them know. For dessert:::: the Chocolate bread pudding and the Fromage blanc mousse. One word::: YUMMY ! The service was good however I got a litlte annoyed when we first entered and just stood there looking like lost children,waiting for someone to check us in.

1.0,6/14/2011,"One of my first misses so far in my NYC summer.  Fail.  The decor and location of this restaurant is awesome - right on Central Park south with huge windows and a very modern interior, I had high hopes for my brunch here.  Perhaps that is what doomed my meal here, but I was unimpressed and actually disappointed by both the service and food here.  I hate being this harsh, but I don't think I'll ever be back here again.Service here was slow.  Really slow.  For some reason, tables around us (we were a table of 4) were getting their orders in and getting served faster than we were, even though we'd been seated at least 15-20 minutes before the others around us.  Probably took us a good 40-45 minutes from ordering to getting our food.  Granted, we did order 6 entrees between 4 people, but still... the restaurant was NOT packed and/or busy.  Not a good way to start a meal.Other than that, the food was not good.  My eggs benedict (my standard for any brunch place - I passed up a lobster omelet to get these) was terrible.  First, the eggs were improperly poached - one of my eggs had the yolk cooked all the way through, which is just unacceptable.  Second, my english muffins were soggy and falling apart by the time I got them.  I probably should have said something while I was at the restaurant, but I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes to get my food.  At $24 for an eggs benedict, I was expecting the best.  This dish was far from it.  Pancakes were dry.  Maple syrup was good though.Fresh squeezed OJ was awesome.  Probably the only redeeming part of the meal, even if it was $8 a glass.",0,0,0,Winston G.,"Chicago, IL",458,809,23

I especially like all the wine bottles on display in the glass as you walk into the restaurant through the Essex House Hotel entrance. We started off with wine and I had some pomegranate cocktail which was deelish! Afterwards we sat down at a table by the fireplace. The seats are really comfy also!We started off with the salad and duck liver thing. Yummee!Then proceeded to the linguini with clams, scallop dish and a lobster dish. All three yummee also, but the lobster, OMG was so so fresh and good. Haven't had such great lobster in awhile! The scallops were heavenly, cooked just right. So yummee also! Linguini with clams is my fav italian dish of all times, but Chef Kerry topped it with some kind of fish, I think cod, which made it taste so much better :).For dessert we had the chocolate cake and cheesecake. So yummee and pretty. Didn't want to ruin the presentation, but I had to indulge myself!Overall, it was an amazing dining experience down to the decor, staff, drinks and food.

4.0,4/11/2011,"First off, What is up with the crazy entry door that's stuck in a wind tunnel and won't open!? The maitre'd happened to see me and ran out to help me open it - me pulling and him pushing finally did the trick. I feel bad that they have to constantly apologize for their door. Thank goodness that unlike the Door of Rejection, the staff was all very welcoming and hospitable.When I arrived, both the maitre'd and hostess were at the door and I just hung around until the rest of my party arrived. They have a nice bar area in front of the wall-to-ceiling windows of the building facing Central Park South, so where the decor inside is eclectic modern elegance, the windows really bring the outside in. By the time the rest of my party arrived 15 minutes later, both the maitre'd and hostess left the front door unattended, so I had to usher them in (helped them get the door open). The hostess returned and lead us all to our table by the fireplace, a very cozy area. I loved the seating - very comfortable and inviting us to stay for hours wining and dining.Our guest of honor in our group was the bride-to-be. We received some congrats from a couple of the staff, but not much more acknowledgment than that (offer a glass of champagne, idk?)...  The glass enclosed wall of wine is gorgeous and we were allowed to take our time selecting from the menu, was not rushed in our dining experience, the food was cooked and presented very well, and the service was very good.I must say that for the price of the dining experience the menu at Southgate is not very inventive. The food itself is just done well. My celery root soup had just the right hint of mushroom to cut the creaminess. My salmon was done medium rare and was juicy and tasty. The dessert, I ordered a chocolate pot de creme. It's a bed of chocolate mousse topped with what looked like chocolate Dippin Dots and tasted like mini chocolate wafer balls which I thought was interesting.They also have an interesting cocktail menu and great wine list, although I did not happen to drink that evening... This is a great restaurant to try and can be a great place to meet up for just drinks or a dinner date with your boyfriend/girlfriend/wife/hubby.

Whenever the waiter came to refill our wine glasses he would obviously fill mine more than my husbands--was he doing the ""boys club"" thing in hoping to get me drunk so my husband could take advantage of me?  Seriously!!  We opted out of dessert- didn't want to dump any more money into this dive- our bill was $150 already and all we had was a bottle of wine ($48), filet mignon, scallops and one salad.  We only tipped the guy 10% and I wrote on the bill- ""service could have been better""- which quite honestly is an understatement.  the atmosphere is wonderful, the decor a delight, the roaring fireplace very inviting- but if you don't have service- those things don't matter for shit!",2,0,0,Pam H.,"Redwood City, CA",240,169,90

The first course lobster-squash bisque was the best part of the whole meal. If I were more hungry, I would perhaps complain about the portions, but this time I was completely satisfied. The chef came out to check on everyone's meals as a bonus. While he caught us by surprise, in searching for feedback, I realize I did not have much in particular to rave about. In terms of service, we were a bit slow to be seated, and when the restaurant got much crowded later, it felt like the staff forgot about us a little.

After two visits to the restaurant, my boyfriend and I both agree that the food is great, but the service is some of the worst we've ever seen in Manhattan, and we've eaten at Per Se to the $2.50 falafel stand. After being seated for about 10 minutes, your lucky to have one of the 10 look-alike waiters come to your table. On our first visit we were offered the very hip iPad wine menu and had a great meal. I had the fig and goat cheese salad and the halibut - both were amazing. My boyfriend had the gnocci, which was also good. When it was time to order dessert, the waiter came over. We ordered a cheese plate and a S'mores. The cheese plate came (there was no description of which cheeses we had received and they all tasted as though salt was added). My boyfriend is an expert on cheese and this was rather disappointing, especially the lack of description. After we had the cheese plate for about 10 minutes, we were still waiting for the other dessert. Finally, a random waiter came over with two desserts, and he started to put down the ""cheesecake"" and I said, we didn't order that, so he walked away very confused and took them away. After about 5 or more minutes went by, we had to flag someone down to ask where the s'mores was. He said, with a laugh, ""Oh, I thought you ordered the cheesecake."" We said, ""No, we ordered the cheese plate and the s'mores!"" He said, no, you ordered the cheesecake - I thought you didn't want it (when we sent the other waiter away). And he basically could not understand what went wrong, couldn't understand what we were saying and was no apologetic as to the time we spent sitting there waiting for a dessert he didn't know we wanted and he clearly didn't care. He did not speak English other than what was exactly written on the menu. The second dining experience, the same waiter served us and it took him 10 minutes to arrive at the table. He didn't give us the wine list. He served the woman next to us the wrong salad and apparently they had a whole conversation about the salad she was ordering. The best was that I ordered sparkling water and my boyfriend ordered still. He comes over and asks me which water I want. I said, sparkling. He then proceeded to ask my boyfriend if he wanted still or sparkling. I mean, really? He couldn't use his brain and figure out that since I had sparkling he probably wanted still? Clueless. Then we had to wait another 10 minutes to ASK for the wine list adn then we ordered and had to show the picture of the wine to the waiter as not to have him bring some random thing. I had the heirloom tomato salad and it was very good and I had the scallops which were good, but a little overcooked and slightly fishy. Finally, after having an empty water glass for over 10 minutes and waived my hand, yelled out to the waiter (he was one foot away), waived my hand again, pointed to my glass from a far and finally had to wave my hand again, he came over to ask what I wanted. I said, water. When we asked for the check, they took so long, that we finally left without even writing the tip down. We are staying at the hotel, so they had already asked the room number, but he probably didn't notice that we left for another 10 minutes or more. The food is good, but only if you can handle the worst service and waiters who cannot understand English. One more thing. My boyfriend asked if something was vegetarian. Instead of saying, yes. The guy said, it has blah, blah, blah and blah. And so my boyfriend asked AGAIN, is it vegetarian?! And he finally got it (we didn't want a list of ingredients - just answer the question). We have a very low tolerance for stupidity and this is probably our last visit to the South Gate - I don't think a 100-dollar coupon makes the service bearable.",0,1,0,Sara S.,"New York, NY",4,23,7
2.0,9/21/2010,"The dining experience at South Gate was rather dismal. We have had lovely experiences at the suite of Union Sq Hospitality Group's restaurants: Eleven, Modern, Maialino, Gramercy Tavern, Union Sq Cafe etc and thought that perhaps the experiences, be it food or service could be relived here but it disappointed on both counts.Perhaps we came on an off day (Labor Day) as lunch was surprisingly quiet. By contrast, when we lunched at Jean-Georges on a previous Fed holiday, all tables were full so I guess it set the tone for what to expect in a way.Not sure if the staff were on vacation that day. The sommelier never came by our table. Instead we were served by an very inexperienced wait staff (who I later found out to be the bartender standing in as wait staff that afternoon). However, one would expect staff to go through a certain level of training even if they were stand-ins.One originally thought that the digital wine list was a novel and selling idea but that soon wore off with the poor service execution and no sighting of a proper sommelier. So what else happened on our visit there:- How about a fly in our wine? and while the glass was replaced, no apologies or customer appease was attempted. Not that we were mad but just thought that the situation could have been handled on South Gate's end a little more professionally- How about getting asked in the midst of our appetizers whether it's ok if they brought our mains out because they were done??? Mind you I was not even halfway done with my app (you'll understand when you read my gripe about the red pepper flan below)... and I NEVER in my life would think that a perceived to be fine-dining place like South Gate would pull that on us with that. Mind you, this was not a question, for my companion spotted the other servers coming out with the dishes while the waiter was checking with us on that - as if it was acceptable for it to be such. For a minute, we thought we were in Chinatown or at a buffet table! Red Pepper FlanThis was the supposed dish to try and I went for it. I'll say while I enjoyed this dish, I was at a dilemma whether to keep going, after the first few bites into this as I liked the taste but overall it was a lil too rich/ heavy for an appetizer.Burrata Ravioli: Enjoyable.Lamb PorterhouseMy dining companion and I both ordered this dish and were utterly disappointed at the execution. What had been requested for medium rare ended up more like well-done with a tiny bit seemingly medium well. Chocolate Pot de Creme: Not sure if I should applaud this place for serving such a basic dessert that one could easily whip up at home even without culinary experience.Overall, South Gate seems a bit off - I guess an empty restaurant should have sent warning bells off the minute we entered. Sad to say, but the execution (every aspect of it) departs from the grand interior and decor.",0,0,0,Laur T.,"New York, NY",26,780,0

After making a reservation and begging my boyfriend to come (I don't think he is a fan of hotel restaurants) we went on a Monday night as a beginning of the week pick-me-up. After being seated immediately and taking in the gorgeous and over the top interior (which I feel in love with right away) we poured over the menu and cocktail/wine list, which was given to us on a iPad. We could sift through and view the cocktails all on that iPad and select the drinks we wanted. I'm a sucker. I like things tourists like. Whatever. I don't even care, because this was cool and you know it. After selecting a ginger and bourbon drink (which was amazing, FYI) I had the Fluke Sashimi appetizer which was a tad too lemon-y for me, but still pretty good and as an entree, lamb porterhouse accompanied by orzo and a roasted garlic-sherry emulsion. That was very, very yum. Dessert was Nougat Glace, and of course I ate every last bite. I was super impressed with the atmosphere, high tech level of service and how interesting and well the food was prepared. I went in there thinking it was only going to be so-so, and came out a big fan.

There is a nice $25 pre-fixe menu (although there are only two choices for apps. entrees, and desserts).We ordered a mushroom pizzette app for the table (given all the shoutouts from Yelpers) and we were not disappointed. The crust was thin and crunchy. There were a LOT of mushrooms, and they seemed to have been cooked in a balsamic vinegar reduction... either way, very flavorful. Could barely taste the cheese, which was fine.I got the pre-fixe menu (which is different from the menu they have listed online - they should really change that). Got a corn something for the app, (can't remember the name). The corn was very crunchy, but could have had more of its natural sweet flavor. I was not a huge fan of the gelatinous thing that came out with the corn. Very little flavor. Beautiful presentation though.My lunch companions got the caramelized onion soup, which looked pretty good as well (yes, they brought out a bowl with the stuff, and then poured the soup in - always an extra notch for service), and a bruschetta with toasted figs and other yummy delights.As for the entrees - I got the hanger steak (not steak frites), which is about 6 slices of steak, displayed beautifully next to a small salad and some tossed cucumber, bean mix with flavored croutons. I liked the steak the best - it was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and had this yummy sauce next to it on the plate.One lunch companion had the steak frites (entrecote), and that piece of meat looked pretty good as well.We got the cheesecakes (that came w/ the pre-fixe) to go, and they looked very pretty. There was a blueberry topping (couldn't tell if it was fresh blueberries because there was also a lot of blueberry sauce). The cheesecake itself was very good - smooth, and overall just enjoyable.The best part was that the service was very friendly (this got them bumped from a 3.5 to a solid 4 stars). Our server was very nice and attentive (he was joking with us at the end of the meal when he brought our cheesecakes to go). The Executive Chef Kerry Heffernan stopped by our table after the meal and we had a nice (but brief) conversation about if this was our first time here (which it was) and how we heard about it (word of mouth and Yelp for confirmation). We exchanged cards AND the owner of the restaurant stopped by a few minutes later to welcome us and also hand out his card. The personal attention from the owner and the executive chef was very nice and we definitely appreciated this attention to detail.  My only issue was that, after we got the coffee, the servers were no where to be found (I personally like to get the check out of the way so we are free to go whenever we are done, as opposed to waiting after we finished talking to take care of the details of the bill). This could have been because they didn't want us to feel like we were being rushed, so they tried to give us some space. I'm much more willing to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt (verses what happened at Maze - see prior review) because when I asked for the check from one of the hosts (maybe it was the owner?) who was at the bar, they were very polite about it and said they would take care of it immediately. It didn't sound as though I was inconveniencing them and I really appreciate that (especially after what happened at Maze the day before). Overall, great service.  Lunch did end up costing $140 for three people before tip (even though two people ordered off the pre-fixe menu). This was because the sodas were $6 each (a little steep), and coffee was $6.50 (which is more reasonable).

My only complaint is that their menu does seem a bit small, but I will say that the salads were absolutely fantastic. One of the best salads I've had in the city - the chicken was perfectly cooked. I loved (and expected) the soup presentation where they put the ""stuff"" in the bowl first and then pour the soup via a teapot over the top of mushrooms in my case. The brie on the cheese plate was also top notch - I've had a lot of cheese in this city, and that was a memorable one.Don't be misled about ""views of the park.""  When I see that in print, I expect an actual view of Central Park - not the sidewalk that leads into it, which is what you get here.

3.0,7/29/2009,"My recent Restaurant Week trip to the opulent South Gate was sadly marred by inconsistent service.   I had been eager to visit this beautiful dining palace since I first strolled past the glamorous space.  A look at their pricey menu was a huge deterrent, however, so Restaurant Week was the perfect time to sample its gourmet cuisine.  As my friend and I entered the large room with its soaring ceilings, we were shocked to find a vacated hostess stand.  We lingered for a moment or two, but when no one arrived, we climbed the short staircase into the main dining area.  Oddly enough, we were approached by the same man that later became our waiter.  I told him about our reservation, at which point he nodded and went to grab some menus.  Since I had booked through OpenTable.com, I wanted to ensure that I received credit for my reservation, so his reaction worried me.  However, a woman, whom I assume was the hostess, quickly scurried over, so I again mentioned the reservation.  I believe she went over to the computer to confirm, but she basically just allowed the waiter to show us to our table.  She then walked back over to the bar to mingle with the other staff members, once again leaving the entrance unattended.  My friend and I took our seats and glanced at the menu.  We were soon distracted by random bottles, glasses, and leftover trash that remained atop many of our neighboring empty tables.  Clearly this lack of cleanliness was a major faux pas that made us question the safety of our meals.   The mess was not our only diversion in the room, though.  While one wall was covered in a gorgeous, floor-to-ceiling, cherry wood wine cellar with glass doors, the opposite wall was covered with a funky layered mirror, and the rear panel was carved to contain a large fireplace pit.  The crazy decor was haphazard and vertigo-inducing.  A table of rowdy senior citizens, one twisting what looked like a bra around his finger, contributed to the downright strange environment...Just when we thought it could not get any weirder, my friend's requested glass of wine was rejected as being out of stock.  Then, when she tried to substitute it with the seasonal cocktail, the bartender advised against it, saying that it was not recommended taste-wise.  When does that ever happen anywhere else?  Her Black Dog Amber Ale replacement, however, was a full-bodied fragrant treat.  My glass of Spanish Albarino was fruity and also quite delicious.   While we sipped our beverages and laughed at the atmosphere, we munched on the chef's amuse bouche, which was oddly a basket of cheddar cheese biscuits.  While they packed a bold, smokey flavor, they were extremely dry and potentially left over from an earlier lunch or breakfast service.  We were starving, though, so we dug right in, assuming this would be our bread portion for the evening.  As we finished one to two puffs each, the bus boy stopped over with slices of soft white bread, which was much more appetizing.  Who serves so many carbs in this day and age?!Anyway, we placed our Restaurant Week menu orders and threatened that the meal better be extra tasty at this point.  Luckily our harsh criticisms were abated with fantastic food.  We each started with the Flan Of Red Pepper.  This delicate mousse possessed the perfect amount of spice and was plated with chunks of fresh crab meat and a lightly dressed string bean salad.  The flavors were so unique that our distinguished palates could not even describe them; all we knew was that this course was pure heaven.  My Grilled Halibut entree soon arrived, continuing the blissful experience.  The large, moist piece of fish was perfectly cooked and served in an amazing broth of leeks and Yukon Gold potato slices.  Caperberries added a salty element to balance the dish.  My friend's Hanger Steak, however, was grilled with a bland red wine and shallot reduction.  It was accompanied by couscous and a corn-mushroom salad, neither of which added much spunk to the plate.  Though she was somewhat let down by the dish, she was still feeling positive about the meal.  After a few minutes of digesting, we plowed on to our desserts of Nougat Glacé.  This dense, almost meringue-like marshmallow of nougat was packed with nuts, adding a fantastic crunchiness to the texture palette.  Three roasted apricot slivers were candy-coated with  a sweet wildflower honey and served alongside the milder nougat.  A crisp ribbon of phyllo dough lay across the top of each, acting as a bridge between the flavors and textures.  Lastly, our check was presented with a plate of rich hazelnut truffles, uber-sweet raspberry jellies, and lemon macaroons.While I enjoyed my South Gate meal that Restaurant Week afforded me the opportunity to sample, I will probably not return to the spot.  There are too many other fine dining restaurants to try, and hopefully they will provide a higher level of service.",0,0,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,4/1/2009,"Stayed at the Essex for a weekend about a month and a half ago last February, so yelping for breakfast, lunch, and drinks.This place is gorgeous. A feast for the eyes, to say the least. Mirrors and modern art everywhere.We had a light lunch here on a Saturday afternoon, which was very good. My man-friend had the grilled chicken panini (can't remember exactly what fancy cheese it had, but he is a cheese lover and thoroughly enjoyed it). I had the mushroom pizzette, which has been yelped a bunch on here...LOVED it. Highly recommended! I am not even a huge mushroom fan, but wow, delicious; it was really nothing like I've ever tried. The crust was wafer thin--and me, being the carb-phobic diner that I am, loved that part of it. It was loaded with mushrooms, onions, greens (possibly? I can't remember) and just the right amount of cheese so that it wasn't drenched soggy. What a combination. Way later that Saturday night we also came back here for a few nightcap vodkas. The bar was fairly busy, although not as many people as I may have expected considering it was the weekend. Nicely styled group mostly in their mid 30s, possibly 40s. I have no doubt I was by far (10+ years) the youngest one there that evening. Not crowded, but no empty places to sit. Bartenders were fast with the drinks and prompt with service, so props for that.Both mornings we also had the breakfast buffet here. Now this is to die for. There was so much to eat, and everything, everything was wonderful. I need to particularly rave about the smoked salmon -- I could eat that every morning for the rest of my life. So fresh! And their cream cheese was REDUCED FAT. Major props to a fine dining institution that somewhat supports my neurotic calorie counting. The bathroom scale/my sanity thanks South Gate. Because of this, I was able to indulge in half a croissant to top off the salmon/cheese combo. Freshly baked and so yummy. As far as the rest of the buffet: I have never had such a variety of flax, granola, whole grain cereals, organic seeds and nuts! Moreover, there were dozens of organic, low fat, fat free, etc. yogurts and milk choices to complement. Tons of regular baked goods and dessert pastries. And of course there were the standards of fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns...you name it, and it was there. I finished breakfast with a delicious muesli parfait! Given our stay right at The Essex House, South Gate was perfect for easy, fine dining.",0,0,0,Natalie P.,"Dallas, TX",32,52,2
3.0,2/25/2009,"I had high hopes for this restaurant.  I spotted it while walking through Central Park South and fell in luurve...  It's gorgeously appointed, luxe, modern and elegant.  When I discovered that Kerry Heffernan, formerly of Eleven Madison Park, was at the helm, I was just so sure this would be a home run.I went off of the Restaurant Week menu and my bf ordered a la carte.  I started with the Cauliflower Velouté house smoked scallops, trout roe, lovage, tarragon oil.  There was only one teeny smoked scallop and a few beads of roe in the middle of the bowl and the rest of the veloute was wan and tasteless.  Hopelessly blah....I stopped eating it after a few spoonfuls.   Next for my main, I ordered Crisped Beef Short Ribs And Hangar Steak yukon gold potato puree with wasabi crème fraîche. It was good but nothing to write home about.  The absolute highlight of my night was the passion fruit meringue tart.  WOW.  Angels were singing with every bite!  The tangy passionfruit gelee on top of the creamy custard filling of the tart was mindblowingly good.  Undoubtedly the best dessert I have ever had, it deserves 5 stars.My bf ordered the Caramelized Onion Consomme and the Butter Roasted Lobster w/ Kimchee, red-pepper marjoram broth.  He said it was good and didn't have much else to say about it.  I think that's the overarching theme about the food at South Gate.  It's good but the elaborate menu descriptions, gleaming decor, star chef and high prices would lead you believe the food should be much more grandoise than it is.  Sadly the whole is less than the sum of the parts at this restaurant.Given the prices, I would much rather go down the street to Nougatine/JG where the food is expertly turned out every time.",0,0,0,babe p.,"New York, NY",0,13,0
3.0,1/29/2009,"I went to South Gate for Restaurant Week.  It is a very beautiful restaurant in the Essex Hotel.  Entrees are in the smaller side, but nicely presented.  Food and drinks are also very expensive and for that reason, I probably will never come back, unless it's Restaurant week.  I feel that you'll get more for you money in other NYC restaurants.  The decor of the place is very modern minimalistic.  They have thousands of wine to choose from ranging from ($42 to $2000+).  They have this futuristic computerized wine menu with a stylus pen attached to it.   It is a little screen where you can click and select what flavor or type of wine you are in the mood for.  For starters, I got the Butternut Squash Flan.  I'm a huge fan of Butternut Squash but when I got my order, it tasted like really bland egg omelette.  Big disappointment.  I got the beef rib and steak as my entree.  It was really small but flavorful and tender.  Desert was great too, my friend and I shared a Cheesecake and the Walnut Cake.So, overall, it was a great time (duh surronded by good friends).  I recommend checking this place out during Restaurant Week.",0,0,0,Benson B.,"New York, NY",8,37,0
4.0,1/27/2009,"This place has a beautiful ambiance, wonderful food and friendly service. It is a bit pricey - but I suppose that is what you get for central park locals. The décor is beautiful and includes a fireplace. The private areas are also beautiful. The place feels bright, clean and fresh - not stuffy at all. They have a great wine list, and good variety of food. The food is beautifully plated and delicious. I would recommend for dinner or brunch.",0,0,1,Jennine J.,"New York, NY",12,30,0
3.0,1/18/2009,"South Gate is the elegant in-house restaurant of the Essex House hotel.  It is elegant in that chromey, muted, sparsely leathered Manhattan-in-the-movies way.  It has a noted chef (Kerry Heffernan) and everything.But no, I will not pay $20 for a sandwich at lunch when two of the four sandwich options on the menu are not even available at the ripe lunch time of 1pm -- especially when the one I caved in to ordering after all left me still hungry and several burgers poorer.",1,0,0,Ladida D.,"New York, NY",13,116,1

5.0,10/9/2008,"My mom was staying at Essex House and so on her last night in NYC, we decided to try out the restaurant.  WOW!  Simply put -- one of the best meals I have ever had in NYC.  Gorgeous restaurant -- very minimalist (if you like that style, which I do).  Gorgeous hotel.  Impeccable service -- Our waitress was this extremely friendly Japanese woman -- by the end of our evening, we were talking about our families even.  It was just a great experience all around.  This is definitely one of the best kept secrets in the Theater District, Central Park South area (only 3 yelp review?!?).  I mean, I know it's an expensive place, but it was truly amazing.  When I dined it wasn't even that full on a Saturday night, which surprised me to be honest.First off, the restaurant has a fricking computerized wine list.  It's like this color touch screen e-book type thing that has like 800 wines.  The waitress said that in a few months, they hope to have over 1200 wines there.  It was just a fun device to play around with -- So it basically took me like 10 minutes to decide on a bottle of wine.  haha.  A wine lover and sommelier 's dream --  just update the wine list electronically!  The sommelier came up to us and we had a nice 5 minute convo on Napa Valley wines.  Really nice guy.  The cocktails are also great too.  I tried several of them a few days earlier.We opted not to have any appetizers -- I ordered a flank steak with a reduced vinegar sauce.  It came chopped up and covered a bed of greens.  On the side, were two amazing ravioli stuffed with meat.  WOW.  The plate looked absolutely amazing.  What a culinary experience.  My mother had the duck and she also loved it.  And the meal wasn't even that pricey -- like $35.  It was just the right size too -- It didn't stuff me and make me ill.  I finished and was just satisfied.I then ordered for dessert a passion fruit tart.  OMG.  The tart was amazing.  The plate was really cute too -- it was longish -- On the left was the tart.  In the middle was a scoop of coconut cream.  On the right was this mini glass of passion fruit juice and cream.  Overall, I loved everything about my dinner.  That's so rare to find.  While pricey, I felt I definitely got what I paid for.  I can see myself returning here for a special occasion dinner.",2,0,2,Victor S.,"Brooklyn, NY",319,314,11

4.0,6/20/2008,"This is a fantastic ""inspired American"" restaurant, in every respect. Fell short of the truly great greats for me, but in all likelihood it's just because I was really there for a quick bite with a friend as opposed to a focused dining experience.It's the restaurant at the Jumeirah Essex Hotel on Central Park South in New York, and the executive chef is Kerry Heffernan, of Eleven Madison Park fame. The room is sparkling and new, had an airy feel to it, and good late night energy even on a Wednesday. The bar is pretty well integrated with the rest of the room, even that would be a good option for a quick bite.The service (as elsewhere in the hotel) was first class in every respect, hostess on down.The food was pretty special as well. We started with the hamachi and foie gras appertizers, the former simply prepared with greens, an herby reduction and what semed to be bonito flakes. Salty and satisfying. The foie groas was indulgent and wonderful, mild, rich, and beautifully prepared. Next we shared a wild mushroom martini - a kind of room temperature consomme of wild mushrooms, fresh spinach and pancetta served in a martini glass. Original, fun and fresh, again with clean flavors and distinct ingredients. For our entree we split a roasted cod on linguica and manilla clams, which was outstanding. The fish was perfectly crusty on the outside but flaky and moist on the inside, in a shallow but flavorful cream-based broth. Again the clams and sausage added some fun, like a Portugese sailor had blown into a Cape Cod port restaurant.I'd go back in a heartbeat, and recommend this to anyone interested in something fresh and new on the park.",4,0,2,Michael T.,"Sudbury, MA",392,60,20
5.0,4/23/2008,"From my confirmation call straight through to their help hailing a cab the staff at South Gate was wonderful. They greeted my usual bubbliness with a warm smile and friendliness. My friend and I were seated towards the back of the airy and spacious dining room. Wonderful decor (I love the swively chairs!!) by famed designer, Tony Chi. Our waitress was fantastic. Nice, helpful and funny. We decided upon the 6 course Chef's Tasting ($95/pp not including wine.) Chef Heffernan and his staff did not disappoint. From the Yellow tail to the ravioli soup to the short ribs - wow! And...wait for it...TWO dessert courses! We decided to go all out and have wine paired with each course...a very wise choice indeed. Their sommelier, Troy, was wonderful. He choice interesting and unique wines for us to try. I liked them all! The only bad part of the evening was having to slightly rush the tasting and dash to the opera. (Not that we didn't enjoy the opera too...) Next time I'll plan the evening around it instead of having a performance too attend.",1,1,1,Kimberli M.,"New York, NY",124,423,156
