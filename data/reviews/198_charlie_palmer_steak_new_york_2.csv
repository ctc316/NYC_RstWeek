4.0,4/26/2019,We had a really fun lunch at this in hotel steakhouse.   The space was pretty.  Our boisterous party of 4 livened up the sedate scene. Our waiter was lovely.  The martini was solid and the least dry martini that I had in a long time. Wine by the glass was good.   The burgers were very good.  Pro tip- get the French fries well done. A chicken salad was really good.  The chicken was perfectly cooked.  We split a brownie sundae and were comped a creme brûlée by our nice waiter.  The only letdown was the meh decaf.   Fun lunch.  The burger was in the top quartile of city burgers. I'm sorry that the don't serve the half and half burger any more. I had wanted to try it. Other reviews have indicated that they do a good restaurant week deal.   I will need to keep that in mind.,0,0,0,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16
4.0,4/21/2019,"Good choice for a first-time steak restaurant! We are a three-people group and ordered a two people steak, a salmon and a brussels sprouts. We ordered medium rare for everything it tastes really good. Our steak is good but I like the middle much better than the side meat since the middle is much more tender. The salmon is decent but the pairing tomatoes and fennel is brilliant. The brussels sprouts is definitely the highlight for me as they are roasted very well but its more towards the softer kind than crunchy kinds. Like any good steak house, the price is a bit over the top but good quality and service. Its also funny that how we all got distracted by their candles which are super innovative and gorgeous! Would love to come back!",1,0,0,Majer M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,28,47
4.0,4/10/2019,"Stopped in to check out spyglass on what was a gloomy weekend day. Food options are limited and the drinks, for the price, was underwhelming. So my wife and I stopped off at the lobby bar for happy hour. Our bartender Sinead was super attentive, very helpful and we ended up staying for a couple rounds because of the banter. The tuna tacos and the hummus are amazing. For the price you cannot beat it. The cheese board, another treat although the meat seemed a little sparse. We will definitely be back again, this place was awesome to pregame before a show.",0,0,0,David H.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,17,4

4.0,2/22/2019,"Before visiting Manhattan I put Charlie Palmer Steak on my list of food because of their amazing happy hour prices. After a long day of being a tourist I finally made it to Charlie Palmer with my friends and we sat at the bar.Service: The employees were really nice and accommodating for our 3 person group at the small bar tables. They were nice and helped us with our food related questions when ordering.Food: We got the mini tuna tacos, fries, mac and cheese and potatoes. I tried everything but the tacos because I'm not a fan of fish but my favorite was the mac and cheese and potatoes. SO DELICIOUS. After a long day of walking through the cold the warm mac and cheese was the best thing to eat. No one got drinks because we didn't feel up to it but there were some really good options and we were tempted.. so if you can you should definitely try the cocktails.Would I come back?

3.0,2/2/2019,"Not impressed!  I have eaten at many of Charlie a Palmer's restaurants  both in New York and Las Vegas in fact just ate at Aureole Las Vegas this week and have eaten Aureole NY many time (used to be a regular at the Town House), The Knick, and Charlie Palmer Steak Las Vegas but this one didn't live up to his reputation with me. It was restaurant week and didn't find the food being offered on that menu worthy of the Palmer name. We had the tagliatelle appetizer which was the highlight and without it I would have probably given this rating a two stars. Yes the restaurant is very nice and the service good but the very thin strip steak was truly boring with a au pouvre sauce. Nothing to highlight the restaurant. All they did was provide you with a very boring menu to give you an inexpensive meal for $42. The French fries with rosemary also were fine but not impressive. I would think you want to give people an opportunity to get to know your establishment I must also comment on the $1.00 Extra I was charged for ""on the rocks""   I ordered a Tito's on the rocks and they charged me an extra dollar because it was on the rocks. The waiter when asked told me you'll get more alcohol when it's on the rocks.  Better charge me more for the drink.  It's not the dollar but the principal of this.

2.0,2/1/2019,"Once upon a time, in Midtown East, there was a very good restaurant called Charlie Palmer Steak. It did not live happily ever after in the Garment District. Service was ""distracted"" at best--though the restaurant was neither overcrowded nor over-large, the attention of the ample staff seemed elsewhere. And the food was middling...in fact it tasted pre-heated.  I suppose the marquis name of this celebrity chef was added to a rather undistinguished hotel to make it a destination. Pity that his name was bought with no evidence of his supervision.  This was a trial balloon during NYC ""Restaurant Week"".  Needless to say, the balloon never achieved liftoff.",0,0,0,Froster T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0
5.0,1/28/2019,"I had never been to Charlie Palmer steak before and thought for Restaurant Week we would give it a try! What a nice evening. The restaurant week menu was a pretty fair price compared to the regular menu. But now having tried the food, I have no problem going back and paying regular prices. You can see the full menu for Restaurant week which had a pretty decent selection. I had the Hanger steak which was delicious and cooked to perfection.  My friend , the birthday girl had the salmon which looked like a painting ! Check out my photo below. So pretty. Dessert we went off the RW menu and I got a special brownie Sundae for the bday girl. Mario was a great server and when we go back I'll make sure I ask for him. He was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. I loved that it wasn't too crowded. It's in the Archer Hotel right on 38th Street between 5th and 6th.

4.0,12/25/2018,"Great experience. Very clean and the decor matched the Christmas holidays which is always great - shows they care and have spirit. Quiet noise level at around 5 pm, which was great to do catch up with a family member. Service was great... chipped water glass was replaced right away. We loved the Caesar salad and the recommended porterhouse for two. Sides were brussel sprouts and hashbrown. Both great, very filling and flavors were in line with steak. But I wasn't too fond of the burnt look of the brussel sprouts. Definitely could have been cooked better. I peeled the outer layers out. It may be because it was caramelized but still didn't look appetizing. Dessert could have been better. brownie with ice cream wasn't executed well. Served in a glass, the brownie, the ice cream and the cream or marshmallow like toppings were not working well together.  Couldn't finish it. Kind of unfortunate because the appetizer and main dish were delicious. But I'd definitely go back to try other dishes, it was well worth the visit.",0,0,0,Yooie S.,"New York, NY",113,113,29

2.0,11/8/2018,Took clients here for dinner tonight and was the most disappointing experience. Have eaten at the restaurant in Las Vegas and I guess I held my expectations too high for this location.  We were seated basically in the lobby of the hotel that the restaurant is located at.  There were 8 of us. Tables were pushed together to accommodate our large party. One of the tables was wobbly beyond belief. Asked twice to fix it and we finally had to shove a napkin under the legs ourselves.  Service was slow. Had to ask for bread and then when it came we had to ask for plates.  Dinner eventually came with large gaps in between courses.  Even the quality of the food for steaks that start north of $50 was just OK.  I had really looked forward to going here for dinner and left disappointed. We complained to management and it basically went on deaf ears. First and last time I will eat here. Wasted over $1000,1,0,0,Rob R.,"Hicksville, NY",0,1,0

4.0,9/29/2018,"I found this place because I was looking for places that had really good happy hour deals. This place has half off all their small plates during happy hour and select cocktails were seven dollars. That's a pretty good deal if you ask me. I got a Mac and cheese plate for six dollars during happy hour. I added truffle oil to it for two dollars and it was magnificent. My boyfriend got the burgers, fries and beer deal for $20. The beer options are select during happy hour, only three. But they had a really good Pilsner on the menu. The restaurant is located in the lobby of a hotel so it's kind of small however, there is actually a lot of seating. There's about seven or eight chairs at the bar. It looks like a really fancy place but the ambience was casual and chill during happy hour. Of course, there were still some men in suits coming there to eat a full dinner/lunch. I think this is an excellent place to go to for happy hour or for a full meal; whether you want to watch the sports game or have a romantic dinner, this place will pretty much do it for you.",1,0,1,Angela L.,"New York, NY",323,298,303
4.0,9/29/2018,"Stopped by for the happy hour on a Friday with the girlfriend. They have half off pretty much everything but their entres when you sit at the bar. I tried out a new beer,  some Pilsner I can't remember, it was good (they only had three in stock). I ended up doing the beer burger and fries combo for $20, and my girlfriend got the Mac and cheese (I'm seeing a pattern here). The burger was your basic cheeseburger, but it was a good soze and coocked very well (the burger was medium rare, I'm not a monster who can eat hockey pucks). The fries were like better, crispier McDonalds fires, and the chipotle sauce they came with was good. My girlfriend added truffle oil to the Mac and cheese and that was very tasty as well. For a steak house the ambiance is a lot more casual than I thought. It was also slightly smaller, as its part of a hotel.

4.0,9/23/2018,"Came here for restaurant week with my significant other. I ordered the corn salad as an appetizer, the hanger steak as an entree. The corn salad was the best corn salad I've ever had. It was so simple yet so full of flavor. The hanger steak was delicious, the portion for me was just perfect. My significant other ordered the mushroom risotto which he didn't really like as an appetizer and the chicken as an entree. I liked his entree really much but he preferred my entree more. We ordered Mac and cheese as a side and it was also pretty good and the perfect portion. It was a bit early when we came here and we were really surprised at how slow the service was when there were not many people there at all. It took forever for us to get our bread, we had asked because we noticed the table next to us had it and we didn't get it until around when we were eating our entree. Also, it was pretty upsetting how it took our waiter about 30 minutes to get us the check after being asked, not that we were in a rush but it seemed like he was definitely hiding somewhere not doing his job.

4.0,8/20/2018,"So I came here with my gf for their Restaurant Week lunch and I have to admit, I thought the meal was great. The decor was modern and sleek and the service was very attentive. This was my first ever Charlie Palmer restaurant and I was impressed. It was also a bonus that Adam Graves was dining in the private area. LGR!The meal:Prime Steak Tartare- Vinegar potato chips, dijonnaise, egg yolk jam. I thought the steak tartare was a great starter, the steak was super clean and really enjoyed the texture, I also liked the homemade potato chips. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Creamy Mushroom Risotto- Goat cheese, crispy shallots, balsamic. I am normally a big fan of risotto for it's rich and creamy texture but the one here was missing that element. The flavor of the risotto was fine and I really enjoyed the balsamic but I thought the texture of the rice was off. I felt the rice should have been cooked a little more and the dish, as a whole, came off grainy. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Roasted Murray's Chicken- Creamy polenta, smoked bacon, braised rainbow chard. This was the holy shit dish for two reasons. First, I never order chicken at fine dining restaurants, second I don't like chicken breast. With that said this dish was fucking amazing! This was easily the best thing that day and probably one of my all time fav chicken dishes. The chicken was so incredibly moist and tender and the polenta was insanely delicious. The polenta was creamy and cheesy and perfect, then add some perfectly cooked chicken and then wham, heaven lol yelp.com/user_local_phot…Grilled Hangar Steak- Bacon-potato terrine, woodland mushrooms, chimichurri. I was expecting this dish to be the one that wowed me the most but I thought this dish could have been better since I am a big hangar steak fan. I enjoyed the flavor of the steak and I liked the mushrooms but I thought the steak came out rather tough and the bacon-potato terrine was undercooked, the potato layers were way too firm. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",15,7,12,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785

3.0,8/16/2018,"Went here for resturant week specials. We first sat over at the bar area they have hh 4-7 m-f and all day sat and sun. It's a good deal 1/2 off cocktails, beer,wine and small plates. They also have some snacky type bites for $5. I definitely would be back for happy hour, the only drawback is they had 1 server working the whole area (it's bar and outside area) so service was slow, the poor girl was literally running from table to table! We then sat for restaurant  week dinner which isn't necessarily a good reflection of normal service or food. The staters were excellent (mushroom risotto and corn salad *arugula is so slept on*). My husband enjoyed his steak but my salmon was meh and not as throughly cooked as I personally like it. Dessert was a travesty. We got the profiteroles oh lord it was bad. The pastry shell was stale and just not good I didn't bother eating it. The sorbet/ice-cream was fine.  The service for dinner was also pretty slow and we got more service from the other staff like the hostess( a total doll) the bartender (what a gem) and their manager I think.

The steak we ordered was very tender and was cooked medium rare perfectly. The wine option was amazing as well.

5.0,4/3/2018,"We came here for the Passover menu, and everything was spectacular. The chef created some delicious interpretations of Passover classics, like a refreshing charoset salad, along with an enormous lamb shank, the meat of which was so tender it practically fell off the bone. Extensive wine list; lots of high-end producers, but enough of a selection of moderately-priced bottles that won't bankrupt you. The service from each and every person we encountered at Charlie Palmer couldn't have been more attentive, and a couple of tiny oops (like bread initially being brought to our table instead of matzo) were immediately corrected with the sincerest of apologies. Additionally, it seems like providing excellent service to patrons is important to the CP Steak group--they took painstaking efforts to ensure a bottle of champagne for a couple next to us celebrating their anniversary was chilled to the couple's exact requested temperature.

3.0,2/4/2018,"Came here as a part of restaurant week. Reservations were easy to make on open table or over the phone. My friend arrived a little early and they accommodated him at the bar. The restaurant itself is part of the hotel, so once you walk in, there is a different hostess stand (for the restaurant and hotel). Every one we've encountered were extremely professional and friendly (from the hostess to waiter, to the manager I assume, who constantly checked up on us to see how we were doing). As for the food, I would say it was mediocre at best. For appetizers, we ordered the salad and short rib agnolotti. The salad was under dressed, not much texture to it. I really love salads but I couldn't finish mine, which was a first. The short rib agnolottis tasted like the meat from a progresso or Campbell's soup. We both had the steak medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked, besides a few charred edges. However it was lacking flavor. In my opinion, the sauce didn't taste like much; a dash of salt would've made everything much better. Dessert wise, the key lime pie tasted like something you could get in a store, but the crust was really good. Only thing I ate out of the entire desert. The brownie was delicious however; can't really go wrong with a warm brownie with ice cream on top.

3.0,1/19/2018,"Pretty disappointing experience overall. Chose to try CP with a group of five. The ambiance is far different from the typical steakhouse--much more modern decor, very few tables, not the classic rustic feel you come to expect. The restaurant is essentially located in the lobby of a hotel. But I'm not dinging them for that--I knew from pictures they're going for more of a modern look, which I liked. The service was good. Quick, but didn't rush us, although we had to go out of our way to flag them down a couple times.The food left a lot to be desired. From the chopped salad, to the sautéed mushrooms, the sauces, and of course, the steaks. The meal just lacked flavor and fell way short of expectations. I didn't mind the lackluster salad and sides too much, that's not really what I came for, but my steak was grossly overcooked. Ordered medium rare, and what I received fell between medium-well and well done, without question. I had to add table salt to everything. We all agreed the steaks lacked flavor and didn't quite live up to the expectations of a high-end NYC steakhouse. And this isn't some snobby group that frequents Lugar's/Wolfgang's/Morton's regularly. Our table ordered a rib-eye, a surf turf, two filet mignons and the ""American Kobe Style"" steak. Only the kobe was juicy and flavorful, but still didn't impress us considering an $89 price tag.Unfortunately, we were in a bit of a rush and didn't have time to send the steaks back and have them cooked properly.

3.0,12/19/2017,"I guess all of the reviews you could write (or read) are a matter of perspective.  With that, when you're dining among the greatest, if not the greatest, cities of the world, your expectations are a bit different from other places.My dining companion and I recently had dinner at Charlie Palmer Steak.  While trying to understand that this a ""newcomer"" type of establishment, we were trying quite hard to not frame our expectations within those of other Manhattan steak houses.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against anyone trying to 'break into the game' to get my steak dollars.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, I could sense that having diners who are not affiliated with the hotel throws the greeter and hostess for a loop.  The start of your dining experience is then clouded by the rather awkward start.As for the actual meal, I really can't complain.  The steaks were cooked as requested and the side dishes complimented the entree.  I can't say I was disappointed by my strip steak, but I certainly wasn't impressed either.  It was more of the ""ok"" variety.  I know that a New York Strip isn't a Filet Mignon and can adjust my tenderness expectations accordingly.  However this experience left nothing to remember it by other than a ""meh"".  The slightly robotic wait service and oddly timed check in by way of our sommelier towards the end of the meal made for a dining experience that leaves you thinking 'there should be more to this' considering the environment.",2,0,0,Phil W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,1

The food is consistently good and the wine selection is impressive. The ambiance is great and the professionalism of the staff is superb. So, why one star? It's simply because of the general manager, Stephen N.

He will ask how their service is going, offer them complimentary wine, tend to their every need BUT HE HAS NEVER IN OVER A YEAR came by to check in on my table.Why does this bother me?Because I spend ALOT of money here and I tip his staff VERY GENEROUSLY. I swear, this man would make eye contact with me and my various staff members and business partners and not even bother even greeting us.The moral of this review is --- come here for the food and ambiance however if you're a person of color do not expect the same service as anyone else spending as much or less than you.

Our server was not the friendliest and when we had some issues, she didn't seem very apologetic. We started with the Caesar salad and complimentary bread. There was a hair in the butter and the salad was very bland and dry. When asking for extra anchovies they gave us sardines instead which we didn't realize until we ate into it and had a nasty fishy taste in our mouth. They did look a little funny, but assumed they knew what they were giving us. We ended up sending the salad back and got the ribeye and veal chop with Brussel sprouts. Both meats were good, but the brussel sprouts fell short. Overall, just an okay experience. Not sure I'd return with so many other options in the city.",0,0,0,Farrah B.,"Orlando, FL",254,56,31

Surprised to find out it was $45 a plate but still, it was exceptional and the highlight of the meal.  2 of us ordered the signature Bone-On Tomahawk for 2 while the 2 other entrees were the NY Strip & Filet. All were ordered medium rare. The tomahawk was basically raw, the filet was perfectly cooked and the NY Strip was over cooked. Of the two sides, one showed up towards the end of the meal and I finally cancelled the 2nd since we were essentially done with our dinner. No apology offered.

We opted for the delicious MARYLAND CRAB CAKE- best crab cakes in Manhattan as far as flavors and portion.  LITTLE NECK CLAMS CASINO were also pretty tasty. For Entree we ordered the SURF + TURF which was delicious and we paired it with the cheesy and decadent aged cheddar mac & cheese and the mash potatoes. I finished everything off my plate as the steak and lobster were cooked to perfection and special rub on the steak was so tasty and gave the steak a perfect finish.

4.0,9/6/2017,"We always like to visit a high end steakhouse with our son to end the summer. This summer ended far too soon. But a good meal takes the sting out of the iminent return to school countdown. This year's choice was Charlie Palmer Steak about which we had read wonderful descriptions of dry aged beef. Bottom line? We're very glad we went.We had a noon reservation and our table was waiting. The restaurant is a cheery oasis from the noise and bustle of the world outside. Tables are spaced properly. No neighbors on top of you. A great view of the kitchen. Tasteful artwork. A friendly staff. So far, so good.We decided to skip appetizers and move directly to the steaks. A rare dry aged ribeye for me. A medium rare dry aged strip for my son. My wife opted for the gorgonzola steak salad. Hash browns, fries. A couple of glasses of rioja and pinot noir.The steaks, supplied by quality supplier Debragga were great. Cooking temps were spot on. I could not detect that the steaks were dry aged until I picked up the bone. I then smelled the earthiness I love from a thirty plus slab of dry aged beef. Although my ribeye had some gristle, it wasn't overwhelming. Both steaks were tender and delicious.My wife could not figure out what cut of steak was in her salad. The menu really gave no clue what ingredients apart from cheese and steak were in the salad But it was beautifully presented with a rare piece of beef as the centerpiece. My wife enjoyed it very much.Fries and hash browns were wonderful. I particularly liked the hash browns which reminded me of a Swiss Rosti potato cake. It was served in four wedges in its own skillet. Terrific. Have to figure out how to replicate that at home.Desserts were ok. My wife enjoyed her sticky bun. My son and I both had a brownie with candied walnuts and ice cream. Very nice but not exceptional.A nice, leisurely meal in a great space.

2.0,7/21/2017,"My friends and I like to try out different NY steakhouses and Charlie Palmer was up. The steak was good. I ordered the tomahawk for 2 to split with a friend. The portion was much smaller than comparable steakhouses, especially for the price. The steak was of excellent quality but, to be honest, I would sooner spend the money at Del Frisco's, Peter Luger or Wolfgang's. The sides were just Ok. We got the mac and cheese, potatoes and greens. Again, other steakhouses win here. The real issue though was service. After our appetizers we waited 30 minutes for our steak. The waiter came and told us the steaks will be out in 7 minutes (not sure where that precise time came from). 30 more minutes pass (I timed it) and we finally got our steak. They gave us a Caprese salad and something else super small to hold us over (6 guys). Again the steak came out and it was OK. I mentioned to one of the staff the really long wait time. He said he would tell the manager or waiter. Nobody came it to explain or apologize. We ordered desserts and they again were just OK. By no means bad but very par for the course. I was surprised nobody at the restaurant wanted to rehabilitate the situation. No surprise comp on the bill either. The service sucked frankly. I wouldn't come back for the food anyway given the competition but the service sealed the deal. Given the cash spent and expectations, two stars is appropriate here.

3.0,2/10/2017,"Winter Restaurant Week 2017 for the Lunch 3-course special($29)I came here for the Restaurant week lunch special. Unlike other Restaurant week Steakhouse lunch specials, this restaurant's lunch special price prolongs to 5PM instead of 3PM. I had reserved a table before hand on opentable for lunch. I'm not too sure if they take walk-in, but it doesn't seem to be busy around 3PM. I LOVED my appetizer! I ordered the French Onion Soup. This was my first time having french onion soup and I have officially fell head over heels over it from just the smell alone. My bowl had a huge chuck of cheese(gruyere cheese) and a slice or bread soaking right underneath. My suggestion is to try to finish the soup while it is still hot. Its only good when it is pipping hot. I also tired the Braised Short Rib Agnolotti appetizer. I couldn't taste the short rib in the agnolotti at all. I don't suggest this dish unless you're looking for something light. As for an entree, I had the Double R Ranch Sirloin, medium rare with a side of mash potatoes. The overall dish was a bit bland for my liking. There wasn't much flavor, but the grill taste of the steak was definitely there. But Kudos for the perfectly cooked medium rare. The sirloin had a nice pink color to it. Lastly for dessert, I tired the Cheesecake ""Pudding"" and the Chocolate + Espresso Budino. LOVED IT! I can't say which dessert is better, but each one had it's own special kick. The Cheesecake had a blend of sour and sweet. Unlike the traditional NY cheesecake, their cheesecake pudding has a slight savory taste. A scope of the cheesecake pudding, and the raspberry topping was a blast of flavor. Not to mention the Chocolate + Espresso Budino. The light whip cream, thick espresso pudding and a thin layer of caramel on the bottom of the cup was perfect bite of bitterness and sweetness. I really enjoyed my meal here, but I wish the sirloin was more flavorful like the other courses.  Overall, the menu items for Winter Restaurant Week 2017 had courses that outshined others.",1,2,1,Nicole C.,"New York, NY",137,25,169

Curious to me is if I came in as a walk in instead of with a reservation would have been seated since there was available tables?  Or if a party of two walk in after me they would have been seated ahead of me  ? Don't really understand that policy. During the wait no other parties or reservations came in. Eventually we were seated at 1:10pm. It took a few mins before our waiter came to greet us. We ordered drinks and he asked if we wanted water for the table. He came back in a few mins for our order but the drinks and water never came. Eventually I had to ask for the drinks. We also asked the runner for more bread when he came to clear the plates from our first course but he clears our bread plates, bread knife and butter comes back with the bread but does not bring back bread plates, knife or butter which we had to ask for. If it wasn't for this hiccup this would have been a 4 star review. Very surprising a Charlie Palmer restaurant would lack quality in service.",0,0,0,david l.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,441,1255

To our dismay the restaurant messed up our reservation and we had to wait. I understand when these things happen. It sucks but it's at that point you get to see what kind of place a restaurant is. We waited a but but once we sat down they did go out of their way to fix things. Some wine on the house. A drink or two knocked off. It was appreciated. The soup was the biggest disappointment in terms of the food. I didn't care for it at all. The table ordered up a grilled octopus appetizer which was fantastic. My steak was cooked to perfection. The dessert knocked me out. That or it was the few Manhattans I had. Back to my friends, towards the end they kept moaning and complaining to get as much stuff as possible. Cmon guys. After awhile they shown they're sorry and have gone out of their way to make up for it. It was appreciated.

4.0,2/6/2016,"** Winter Restaurant Week Review **We originally had reservations elsewhere for Restaurant Week but a last minute meeting left us scrambling to find last minute reservations in the Midtown area. A thorough search led us to Charlie Palmer Steakhouse, which had several openings. We arrived just on time for our reservation but were told that they were clearing up a few tables. After a few minutes, we were led to a table-for-four right by the window, which was nice.Our waiter came by to drop off the menu and asked if we'd like to see the wine list, which we did. Wine prices were decent and I had a very nice glass of Riesling to go with my meal. We all opted to do the Restaurant Week menu, which offers three choices for appetizer and entrée and two choices for dessert.For my appetizer, I opted for the Steak Tartare, which is served with a quail egg, gaufrette potatoes and whole grain mustard. I really enjoyed my steak tartare - it was lightly seasoned and the mustard provided a nice kick to the steak. My only complaint is that I wish there was more!My sister and mom both ordered the Butternut Squash Soup with winter spices, green apples, and chive. I took a few sips of the soup and I thought it was quite good. The green apples and squash cubes provided a crunchy mouth feel.For my entrée, I decided to do steak on steak and went for the Double Ranch Flank Steak with truffled potatoes and red wine jus. I ordered it medium rare and I think it came out a little closer to medium, but it wasn't a huge problem. There was still a nice pink center and I really enjoyed the truffled potatoes. It was a solid steak.My mom ordered the Pan Seared Salmon with braised leaks, fingerling potatoes, and meyer lemon emulsion. The salmon was tender and moist, and paired really well with the leak and lemon sauce. If I didn't have my heart set on the steak, I would've definitely ordered the salmon.For dessert, we all opted for the Cheesecake Pudding with graham cracker crumbs and raspberries on top. I actually really liked this dessert because you still get to have cheesecake without it being super filling and heavy. I paired my dessert with a cup of coffee (extra $4.00), which helped to tone down the sweetness of the pudding.Service was fairly attentive. Two mangers stopped by during our meal to check up on us and make sure we were enjoying our meals, which was nice. I don't think Charlie Palmer is the best steak I've ever had, but it is definitely a solid steakhouse. If you're ever in the area and strapped for a dinner spot, give Charlie Palmer a try!",1,0,1,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125

Could not have been a better choice! On the last day of Restaurant Week Winter 2016, we had a perfect lunch: The Restaurant Week menu + additional sides of grilled asparagus and the most delicious creamed spinach in NYC made for a feast. And our server treated us to both of the dessert selections each, not just 1 so we had the cheesecake AND the fruit!  The ambiance makes you feel like you are not in NY; maybe that is because Charlie Palmer has other locations of this concept, but it was certainly a nice escape for 2 hours from the hustle and bustle and a great way to end the week!",0,0,0,Emily C.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",70,23,70

I started off with that as my appetizer and then for my main course I had the steak cooked about medium. It was really great and perfectly cooked. For dessert I had the cheesecake which was also great. It reminded me slightly of yogurt and granola but tasted much better than that. The service was also excellent with the staff constantly refilling our waters. I would say the best part of the night was the fact no one rushed us out even though we there for quite a while chatting away (almost lost track of time).

5.0,2/4/2016,"This place is fabulous. The food, atmosphere, drinks, and the service (huge shout out to Kat and Victor!!) are all five stars, impeccable. I came here with my family during Restaurant Week for my sister's birthday, and we ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu. Everything was absolutely delicious. Favorites: butternut squash soup (appetizer), steak tartare (appetizer), and the double r ranch flank steak (dinner), cheesecake ""pudding"" (dessert). The flank steak dinner comes with truffle mashed potatoes and it was so delicious! I had the roasted Murray's chicken breast, which I thought was okay. The chicken breast itself was not very flavorful, but the mushroom risotto was fantastic. The cheesecake pudding is to die for. I've never had anything so delicious and creative! The cheesecake filling was dense, sweet, and creamy, the graham cracker topping was still crunchy, and the raspberries on top were so fresh and delicious. I would make this at home if I got my hands on the recipe.The best thing about my experience at this restaurant was being served by Victor, who was our waiter, and having the wine sommelier, Kat, around for all of our questions. They were both super attentive to our table, and made my sister's birthday a huge celebration. We ordered one bottle of wine in the beginning of the night, but Victor kept us partying all night by bringing us another half bottle of wine, two bottles of delicious champagne, and even brought over vanilla ice cream and another one of their desserts.

We both however thoroughly enjoyed the truffle mashed potatoes that came with the steak. Dessert was thoroughly disappointing.

1.0,1/29/2016,"Pretty much a complete and total letdown. Came here for restaurant week. This is normally not an area we frequent because it's quite touristy but it was near an event we had with friends later (which we didn't even make it to cause our dinner ran so late...).Service started out great and just nosedived. Water was filled instantly as we sat down, and as soon as we finished our appetizer another waiter was standing there with our entree. Ironically this superb service was at a time when the restaurant was packed. As the restaurant got emptier the service became horrendous. We sat with our plates for literally ten minutes after finishing our entrees - not acceptable for a nice steakhouse. We waited forever for dessert, forever for the check, etc. Ambiance wise I felt the restaurant was really noisy. I could hardly hear my fiancé speak. This may be attributable to the six shrieking girls at the table next to us though, so I won't hold this against the restaurant. It doesn't matter because they failed in most other aspects anyway. Food - this is where I have the biggest bone to pick. Complimentary bread was like something you'd find in communist Russia circa 1960 - literally hard as a rock and stale. Skip it and your jaw will thank you.  For appetizers we ordered the tartare and butternut squash soup. This was simply the worst butternut squash soup I have ever had - no butternut squash and an overwhelming taste and smell of heavy cream.I couldn't finish it. The tartare appetizer was so-so and quite soggy Entrees were okay. I ordered the chicken which was woefully dry. However the risotto it came with is one of the better risottos I've had. Fiancé had the steak and said it was pretty good, but he was peeved that he asked for it to be done medium and it came back more or less well done. Dessert - they ran out of the cheesecake pudding which is disappointing as it is highly reviewed on here. I instead got a chocolate brownie and my other half ended up with mixed berries and whipped cream. No complaints here but these are the types of desserts anyone past middle school could whip up and make edible. Lastly, the bathrooms were completely filthy.I'm talking massive amounts of paper towel on the floor, pee on the floor, no toilet paper, etc. This is a big restaurant and the restroom should be checked on at least every hour if not more frequently.

1.0,1/27/2016,"A few of my friends took me to Charlie Palmer Steak house for lunch for my birthday which happened to be during restaurant week this year. Unfortunately the service was really bad. The bread was cold, our server was not attentive and never asked us if we wanted drinks or even came to check on us once our entrees were brought over. We ordered desert and after approximately 17 minutes of waiting our waitress told us that they were out of the pudding cheese cakes we had ordered. I ordered a lemon aid and that also took 20 minutes to come out then when it did come out the simple syrup I requested it be made with wasn't in it. I'm not sure if the service was so poor because we were ordering from the restaurant week menu or if it was just an off day. We also noticed that we were never offered coffee or tea after our meals.  What I am sure of is that I will not ever return and I will not recommend it to any colleagues or clients. With the amount of competing steak houses in the area you would think they would have pristine service. But unfortunately that isn't the case.

But, the portions are quite small compared to others. I'm not a huge eater, but I like leftovers! There were none and not one of the four of us were stuffed. Not hungry, but you know what I mean. For example, the $10 side of asparagus contained five stalks and not those huge ones. That's $2 per? The Porterhouse for two ($109), which we always order, just wasn't a big as say at Keene's etc. We've never been able to finish it before, but this time we did. The sizzling plate was cool, but the steak continued to cook to medium towards the end. Came out perfect medium rare, though.

4.0,8/22/2015,"We came here on the pre-fix Guilt City special.  Was plenty of food.  It was a Saturday night and the place was not crowded but had enough people not to be weird.  Typical of midtown on a summer weekend.  The decor was classic yet trendy, and they have open outdoor dining connected to the restaurant which gives the place a nice open aired feel.  Don't worry, the a/c keeps you cool.I'll start by saying our server was amazing. He was very personable and friendly from the get go, and often that can make all the difference.  He even chilled a bottle of wine for us that we were taking to a friends house afterwards, in addition to suggesting tweaks to some of the dishes that might be to our liking.  A+The food was good, came out timed well and the wine included with the set menu was ok.The Food:Bread for the table - Focaccia and French Baguette with semi-soft butter. Focaccia was nice and soft, baguette standard fare.Foie Gras Tourchon - delicious, melts in your mouth like butta.  Great coupled with the smushed cherries.40oz Porterhouse for 2 - pretty good.  Cooked to perfection so major kudos for that.  Medium rare was a legit medium rare, and the outside was nice and crispy.  They served it sizzling hot on the skillet at the table, nice job.  A pre-cut steak is a pet peeve of mine but for a porterhouse for two I guess that's hard to avoid.  Also, they brought out hot plates right before the steak arrived... Icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned as I believe a steak should be served nice and hot at the table.  Came with a number of sauces included but I'm not a sauce guy when it comes to steak so no comment there.Grilled Asparagus - good, lemony flavor, small portion.Carrot Cake - fun presentation, not your typical ridiculously oversized piece of cake.  Could have used a little more frosting only because I can't get enough of that amazing cream cheese taste.Overall a very nice low key steak dining experience.  The steak itself could have tasted a little better but I won't complain given they got everything right and that the service was fantastic.  Would definitely come back.",1,1,1,Ernest A.,"New York, NY",178,55,77

5.0,8/14/2015,"Restaurant Week experience review: amazing, amazing steak, and food in general. The quality of the ingredients was so obviously fresh: steak, vegetables, fruit, dessert..everything!! I truly savored every bite, and raved about it with my fellow diners. The waiters and host/concierge were also so generous and kind..Food/Restaurant Week menu (steak tartar, flank steak, carrot cake / strawberry cheesecake):I must first note how good their bread and butter are here..I had to request seconds!And Aside from the quality, the portions were hefty. I expected a smaller steak since this is such a highly renowned steakhouse. Instead, they clearly presented their full capabilities and generosity in their restaurant week menu! The steak was cooked perfectly as expected, and you can tell how high grade the meat is. The steak tartar was also too quality, with a delicious little quail egg on top. The carrot cake was fairly mediocre, but the cheesecake was so delicious and fresh, to the point that typical cheesecakes are now meaningless and worth nothing to my taste buds (it wasn't too mealy or dry).Overall, you can tell they put great thought into the creativity and taste of each of their dishes.In addition to the menu, my table ordered some of their sides (sautéed mushrooms in balsamic vinegar, and truffle mac & cheese), which were behind addicting. They did both sides justice, I would've even just had the sides as a meal.Host/Waiter service:I had arrived after a long day with my diners, we were not dressed as up to par for the steakhouse, and the host/concierge were not judgmental at all (phew!).I had asked the waiter if he suggested the carrot cake or cheesecake off of the restaurant week menu, and he insisted I try the carrot cake, and if I didn't like it, he would bring the cheesecake! (So kind!). I actually liked the carrot cake, it was fresh. And I had centered my plate to let my fellow diners try it, and the waiter was like ""you don't like it? Don't worry!"". I told him I liked it, but then a few minutes later he still brought out a fresh cheesecake :)The host/concierge was so generous, and I assume to help bring service in, gifted me with a card allowing me to bring friends in for a free round of drinks at their bar! I will definitely be coming back (regardless of their service!)Slight negative from the evening was that the service started a little slow, and they were a bit slow to refill our waters, but we're still overall attentive!",1,1,0,Karen C.,"Santa Monica, CA",197,382,1132
5.0,8/13/2015,"Went on a dinner date with my other half at Charlie Palmer Steak last Friday evening for Restaurant Week.  We were both awed by the size and contemporary appeal of the restaurant's interior.  Not only was there outdoor seating, but the restaurant was sectioned off into three areas, with each segment being decently sized.  We were seated in the center where our server Alex (I promised you a shout out!) assisted us.  We started off with a steak tartar and tomato gazpacho.  The steak tartar was beautifully plated and topped with a raw quail egg (I love anything raw) and the gazpacho was generously portioned and very refreshing.  We both opted for the hanger steak with blue cheese mash and ate every last bit of it.  The steak was extremely tender and cooked as we've requested - medium rare.  Finally, we ended our meal with the carrot cake and cheesecake pudding.  The latter was our favorite - it was light and airy and tasted like cheesecake without all the calories and density.  On top of the delightful meal, our server Alex was genuinely friendly and very attentive.  Thanks, Charlie Palmer!!",0,0,0,Maggie L.,"New York, NY",175,286,480
3.0,8/11/2015,"Charlie Palmer Steak was a solid choice to try for NYC Restaurant Week. To get three courses including a hangar steak entree for $25 for lunch is a steal, especially considering that the steak alone is $25 or more. The steak tartare was good, no better or worse than many others I have had. It was on the smallish side and I could have used a more gaufrette chips to scoop up the tartare instead of the paltry two that they gave me. The steak was great. It was a hangar cut, so a cheaper cut with more chew, which would be an expected choice for Restaurant Week- steakhouses aren't going to be giving away rib eyes on their $25 lunch menus. I love hangar steak for its flavor and the little bit of chewiness is fine by me. I felt it was a decent portion and the blue cheese mashed as a side was good also. Dessert was a cheesecake pudding that was good, but nothing I would order again. The downside to the meal was that I ordered an extra course of foie gras to split between me and my wife. I haven't had it in a while and I thought it would be a nice touch. Well the saddest looking piece of foie gras was put in front of us, at a price of $24 mind you. It was a tiny disk that was actually too hard to spread on the toast. Foie in torchon form is supposed to be creamy and have the consistency of butter. The two glasses of Syrah we had were great. The service was competent. It would have been a four if I hadn't ordered that foie gras though.",1,0,0,Rich J.,"Yonkers, NY",85,537,159
4.0,8/7/2015,"**SUMMER 2015 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**My boyfriend and I had a reservation on a Wednesday at 7 pm. The place was only half packed. Looking around, it didn't seem like many people opted for restaurant week, but we did!To start, we both had the steak tartare. This came topped with a quail egg, and some honey mustard sauce to the side. It was my first time trying steak tartare and I loved every bite! I liked it better without the sauce though. The sauce just masked the flavor of the beef.For the entree, we both had the balsamic marinated hanger steak with blue cheese whipped potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare for me). I hate when you order steaks at restaurants and you get their interpretation of what medium rare it - it's usually either too well done, or too rare. But this one was just right (like the Goldilocks and the Three Bears of steakhouses, if you will. Yeah...I went there and yes, I know it was lame). The mashed potatoes tasted like potato buds - you know, those instant mashed potatoes we all used to make in college. There was very little blue cheese in there. The flavor wasn't very strong. It was more like a hint of blue cheese. But the steak was so good, that I didn't even care. My only gripe was that the portions were kind of small. It felt more like a lunch portion than it did a dinner one. After the meal, I wasn't still hungry but I wasn't that full either - definitely not the beached whale kind of full that I've experienced at other steakhouses during restaurant week.Finally, for dessert, I got the carrot cake and he got the cheesecake pudding. I forgot carrot cake has raisins in it, which I hate, so that ruined my dessert a little bit. The cake itself was good though. The pudding was a nice, creative change from the standard heavy slabs of cheesecake you would get.I might come back for another restaurant week - but probably during a lunch. It seems more worth it since the portions are so small here.",1,0,0,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3267

Our reservation was 6:30 so say by 7:30/8 all tables were packed. They need to work out reservations and staffing. A big part of the steakhouse experience is the service.

5.0,5/31/2015,"What an amazing find.  Here is a piece of advice.  On occasion, take the road less traveled, wander around NYC via car or on foot, and just try a new spot.  Sometimes, not always, you will be wowed beyond expectation.  Charlie Palmer Steak was one of those times.  We came for a late supper, and the restaurant was less than half full...virtually dead.  We attributed this however to the ""Summertime in NYC"" mentality, where many city dwellers find escape in a beach house or Hampton's estate.  On a gorgeous night, we decided to sit outside and dine al fresco, all the while taking in the architecture of Manhattan and people watching as they strolled by.  We began our meal, greeted by Rico, one of the finest waiters we have ever encountered as well as an overall generous and kind individual, with a great sense of humor.  He was a gentleman that could appreciate life, and he knows very well how good food and wine exemplifies that mantra.   The Manager and Sommelier, John, was equally inviting and knowledgeable.  Through our conversations we seemingly turned this impromptu dinner into a wine tasting as well, as John and Rico both gave us tastes of some of the better wines available and they were spot on, as we settled into a nice, French Bordeaux.The meal was equally skilled from the chef in preparation and taste.  Here is the rundown:To Start.....a Shellfish Platter from the Raw Bar with an additional dozen East Coast oysters ala carte.  FRESH and delicious.  Nothing else to say!Pre Main Course....Steak House Caesar Salad.  Was elegantly prepared with fresh ingredients, not overly dressed, a few anchovies were delicately laid on top of the salad with several buttery and perfectly seasoned homemade croutons.  Obviously, loved this.Main Course....Porterhouse for 2, with a piece of Sautéed Foie Gras as an add-on, side dishes to try of hash brown and green beans.  The steak was cooked exactly to our like, rare and red in the center with a well-seasoned and developed crust on top.  The foie gras added a nice punch of creamy earthiness to the steak, only enhancing the flavors consumed.  The hash brown was incredible, and although we couldn't quite put our finger on the ""secret"" to it, there was a butter and bacon fat quality to the taste which was a nice hint in what could very well have been a plate of sautéed shredded potatoes.Dessert...by this time although we were bursting at the seems, filled with amazing food and crisp French wines, we still decided to move forward and finish with a taste of something sweet.  Rico, our server recommended the Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble.  It was served piping hot with a mound of vanilla bean ice cream floating in the center.  It was creamy, fruit driven and mildy decadent.  The perfect end to a surprise of an evening.We shall return, and this time, with great friends to relish in everything Charlie Palmer has to offer!",1,0,0,Steven R.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",14,37,0

4.0,2/17/2015,"This used to be Rothman's, and we heard about this from a friend who works in finance and gave it a thumbs up. The old crowd still hangs out here, though it's better lit and more modern feeling, maybe a little generic decor. (My husband was genuinely freaked out by the air plants painted gold. He just thought it was weird. Really. Why?)I read a review that gave a good criteria for judging a steakhouse. 1. The raw bar 2. The sides 3. Martinis 4. The wine list 5. The steak. I have to agree with this.First, let's just get to the meat. Charlie Palmer sources from small family-run farms, and I like that. There are plenty of places in NY to get dry aged corn-fed beef. We went to Charlie Palmer right before Christmas after doing some last-minute shopping. This was Christmas dinner, because my inlaws went to Florida this year, and I worked a double on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. I think my husband was kind of missing the old man and his ""What are you doing with your life?"" speech.Anyway, I don't have to apologize for eating good steak. We got the seafood platter and the Snake River NY Strip from Boise, Idaho. A few reviews have complained the meat wasn't seasoned, but this is a domestic wagyu style cow, and I don't think it needed much. The meat was perfectly cooked medium rare, tender and evenly marbled. A little coarse salt and pepper was enough.I threw the bar for a loop and ordered a Rusty Nail. Back in the day, if you applied for a bartending job, you filled out a quiz and one of the questions was ""What's in a Rusty Nail?"" Kids these days don't know, but it's just blended scotch and Drambuie.The server was totally polite and brought me a textbook Rusty Nail. (I loved their stemware.) The wine list was excellent, as you would imagine. The sides were meh. The seafood was great, and I recommend the platter.",1,1,0,Ginger P.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,300,255
4.0,2/14/2015,"Overall experience: the food was on point. The Steak was great (it's a steak house). The menu is a bit pricey but on special occasions it's okay to want and expect bit more. Our entrees were served very late (read more). The atmosphere was nice. The staff was very professional and we did not expect a complete free meal, we thought we misheard the floor manager. But we were blown away by this gesture. We did not pay for the meal however we tipped $80. We are definitely coming back! Read for the complete story.The story:My boyfriend and I went to Charlie Palmer Steak house for Valentine's Day. He decided to take me due to a review on the newspaper. He made reservations for 7:45pm, we got there on time and we were seated right away. We were seated towards the booth seating area, which was crowded too many two seaters next to each other. I seated on the booth (which had a little comfortable pillow for back support) my boyfriend on the chair across from me, this table was so tight and close to the next that it felt like every waiter who waited our tables around us had their rear end towards my boyfriend who was seating on the chair. We were greeted by our waiter who was very professional and nice, he gave us plenty of time to order. Since it is Valentine's Day they had a prix fixe menu that was set and did not give us a choice for each course, but since I'm allergic to shellfish we opted out and decided to order a la carte. I ordered some wine by the glass, I was definitely turned off by the fact that they gave me a binder and did not make any recommendations. Pinot noir was my choice which I enjoyed very much. Wine experience: beginner.Appetizer:Our one appetizer came out with good time. The Tuna Tartare was really good! The tuna was fresh and it was served on top of avocado surrounded by soy sauce. (It was a bit salty to me they had added salt on top of the dish and it had a bit too much soy sauce.) I read previous reviews about a stale cracker, but the cracker was fresh and it balanced the saltiness of the soy sauce and salt of the dish.Entrées: Because of the holiday, I guess the service was really slow because we waited about 35-40 mins for our entrées. We were not informed by our waiter that our meal would take a bit longer. I asked once (the server) and then my boyfriend asked a second time (a different waiter). The second time we asked (we believe it was the floor manager) came to us an sincerely apologized to us and said that the meal would be on him. We weren't sure of what we heard and we were not expecting a free meal. Overall my boyfriend loves his filet mignon they cooks it perfectly. I loved my ribeye on bone with a nice char and perfectly cooked to order (medium well). Our side dishes were okay(separate charge). Our portions were normal sized not over the top.Dessert:Our first choice of dessert was the poached pear with gingerbread cake and vanilla pecan ice cream, however we went with my second choice of the Pierre's chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream.

5.0,1/1/2015,"I had the most fabulous experience. My party was greeted right away by the server, which is simple yet hard to come by some times. Our first course of suggested appetizers was promptly brought out.  The beet salad was so fresh and The prosciutto and melon was to die for! The saltiness of the prosciutto and the sweetness of the honey dew complimented each other perfectly, and a few almonds wrapped it all up into a perfectly compiled dish that I would highly recommend. The dry aged ribeye was flavorful and juicy and cooked to my liking and I also tried the filet mignon which was possibly the best filet I've ever eaten. Compliments to the chef! I was too full for dessert but that's never a bad thing! Also impressed that everybody drinking at my table never had to ask for a refill but was always thoughtfully taken care of.

2.0,12/31/2014,"My wife and I stopped in here for dinner two days before the New Year when most of the restaurants in midtown were packed with tourists in for the ball drop.  This place, despite the pedigree, was less packed than Ted's Montana Grill, indeed, it was nearly empty.  Not a good sign.  The hostesses were very nice and we were given a lovely circular booth that could have fit 4.  The decor seemed straight out of the mid-90s, with lots of beiges, grays and metallic touches.  Our waiter was nothing special-- not very expressive or personable and, despite the fact that they were not busy, he was not particularly attentive.  The food was a mixed bag.  The bread was quite good, as was the soft, salty butter.  We decided to get the porterhouse for two and so skipped appetizers.  The bread was more than enough.  The porterhouse was fine, but like our server, nothing special.  It lacked flavor--really, it seemed to need some salt--and was unevenly cooked, with the filet side medium to well done and the strip side being closer to medium rare.  For sides we ordered the double-truffle baked potato, which was heavenly (what isn't when it has shaved truffles on top?), and the creamed spinach, which was as tasteless and unmemorable as the steak.  We considered dessert, but nothing caught our eye.  I know no one wants to copy Lugers or Wolfgangs, but schlag Is fantastic, even more so when served on top of chocolate mousse or a sundae.  This place might consider adding something like that to what is a boring dessert list.Overall, this place will need to step up its game to compete with Wolfgangs, Keens, et al., but I wouldn't be surprised if it shutters in a year or two.",2,1,0,Tom R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

We insisted on a new table and we're crammed into another corner in a small back room. Our waiter offered us water then attempted to take our food order.  We asked for drinks. While he was getting those another man in a suit came to take our order.

1.0,12/18/2014,"Some out-of-town friends were staying at a hotel near the restaurant whose concierge recommended it.  I can only assume the hotel gets a kick-back for referrals and aren't concerned with guest satisfaction.  Regardless, the hotel concierge got an earful.We arrived around 7:30 to an unexpectedly empty restaurant.  Tons of empty tables, yet we were seated near a service station in the back of the room where the staff liked to congregate and gossip about customers and co-workers.  Colorful stories about a hostess and a manager's text messages were the scuttlebutt du jour.We waited a long time for our server to initially come over, he had to go check on a couple of questions we asked about the menu, another wait.  Then it took a long time after we ordered for the food to start coming, with a pause between our 1st course and entree.  Food wasn't horrible, but definitely not worth the prices they charge.At no time did a hostess or a manager stop by to see if we were enjoying our meal, I don't actually recall seeing a manager present in the restaurant, busy texting hostesses I guess.  It had all taken so long we had no time for dessert or coffee, but couldn't find our waiter -- until he showed up with free desserts, as if he knew we were overall unimpressed with the place.I've been to the Charlie Palmer Steakhouse in Washington DC, which was outstanding -- the New York one doesn't have the same atmosphere or level of service that we were expecting, doesn't even seem affiliated.  There are seemingly limitless choices in NYC if you're craving a steak -- I'll be choosing among those next time I'm feeling carnivorous...",5,2,1,Sam N.,"New York, NY",0,10,0

We sit there, and sit there, and no one bothers to come by and welcome us or show the menu. I finally had to flag the hostess down and ask if I had a waiter or not! The waitress finally shows up and doesn't say anything except ""sorry..do you have questions about the menu?"" And at that point I had been sitting there for so long, I answered my own questions and was completely famished I needed to order. So I order my steak and my friend gets the surf n turf. We wait FORTY FIVE minutes, and we had to flag the hostess down YET AGAIN because our waitress was no where in sight AGAIN. She apologizes for the wait and says it'll be out in a moment. It comes out 5 minutes later--COLD. a COLD steak. I was so fed up at that point I didn't even bother to complain, wasn't worth it. I quickly finished and got the heck out.

5.0,11/10/2014,"My parents and I made a reservation at CP Steakhouse a few weeks ago for dinner at 7:30pm on a Friday night. The hostess was polite and friendly and had a table ready for us right away. The restaurant has a modern feel and is very simple in terms of design but definitely welcoming and cozy at the same time.Service was excellent. Wait staff was on point. I was impressed by their attention to detail (glasses were always full, dishes were cleared promptly and efficiently, and they even made sure to always place the label of the Pellegrino bottle facing us!). Our waiter seemed very knowledgable when it came to answering our questions pertaining to menu items, ingredients and recommendations. My parents and I had already decided on our entrees off the regular menu but changed our minds once we heard that night's specials. I opted with the skate fish and my parents decided to order the tomahawk for two. We also ordered a bunch of things to share.APPETIZERS:Shellfish platter - Everything on the platter was extremely fresh. The shrimp, crab legs and lobster were all cooked to absolute perfection. Clams and oysters were delicious.Tuna Tartare - This was my favorite. Small cubes of tuna, with ginger, avocado and soy paired with a cracker. The mix of ingredients perfectly complimented one another in both taste and texture.Steakhouse Caesar - Can't go wrong with this, lots of flavor, perfectly dressed.Buffalo mozzarella  -  Beautifully ripe tomatoes, with soft and creamy cheese. ENTREES (both specials):Tomahawk Steak - Bone in, perfectly cookedSkate fish - Sautéed skate wing with velvety and flavorful cauliflower puree. YUM!!SIDES:4 Cheese Mac and Cheese - Jumbo pasta shells in creamy, cheesy goodness. Ratatouille - Excellent compliment to our meal. Not something you would normally see on a steakhouse menu. Creamed Spinach - A classic side to pair with steak. Two thumbs up.2X truffle baked potato - DeliciousDESSERT:Cheesecake Pudding - I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but this INCREDIBLE. I tasted all the flavors of a cheesecake but in a totally different texture. Even after eating all those appetizers, sides and my entire entree, I couldn't say no to this.Shaved Melon -  Light and refreshing. Biscuit with Fresh Strawberries - good. Overall, the ambiance combined with delicious and flavorful food made for a wonderful night out. The attentive wait staff anticipated our every need and we left feeling happy and more than satisfied.

4.0,10/12/2014,"Charlie Palmer Steak overall score: 89My wife read an article about Charlie Palmer's new steakhouse opening up at the old Rothman's location. They were offering a 15% off promotion since it was their soft opening, so we jumped on it. My wife also made mention that we were celebrating a birthday on her OpenTable reservation (this will be important later).Flavor: 9We had two cuts of steak: the bone-on rib eye, and the terres major. I had never heard of that cut before. Apparently it is off the shoulder area, and is tender like a filet. To me, it was somewhere in between a hanger and a filet in flavor. It had a great char on the outside and was cooked perfectly medium rare on the inside.The rib eye was really nice. Also perfectly cooked, and very juicy with only a little bit of bleed out going on. My only gripe is that I think the rib eye needed some more seasoning. I found myself dipping into the sauces too often for a boost of flavor, but the sauces were very good (see below).",0,2,0,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300
3.0,10/1/2014,"#1- Only go here if you're planning to pull out the old green Amex and expense this.#2- I've experienced much better steakhouses in the city. The prices are high, the flavors are pretty low. Nothing special and I tried everything. Well, okay, not everything on the menu- but enough. Appetizers:Tuna tartare- Fresh fish cubed over some avocado. Lacked salt + acid and presentation was lame *over ice* and came with two wimpy semi-stale crackers.Tomato-mozzarella salad- Not sure how you can mess this up but please for the love of God sprinkle some sea salt on mozzarella. Tomatoes were fine but not the freshest. Again, whatever.Fig + Prosciutto- comes with toast. Literally a few slices of prosciutto on a plate topped with a few figs and a sprinkle of almonds. Nothing more.... Market Salad- Terrible. $16 for really oily greens with corn and radish. I mean if you're charging me $16 for mixed greens the dressing better at least be kickass.Shrimp cocktail- tasty.. can't complain. Large portion too. Entree: Filet mignon was well.. filet mignon. Not enough sear on the outside but properly medium-rare. The sauce that came with the steaks was delicious and it was their homemade peppercorn. The fact that they offer all of the steaks ""blue"" (i.e cold in the center, as described on the menu) totally freaked me out. Who wants cold steak? Slightly frustrating that the $50 filet comes with a whopping total of 0 sides because of course, sides are ala carte. I had the nicoise salad which was not good.Same oily market salad with oily stringbeans, potatoes, and a 6-minute egg (although it was listed as 4-minute on the menu). I'm an egg snob and damn I just wanted a runny egg on my salad. A few slices of tuna over the top but again, way too oily and please squeeze a lemon over this.Crispy chicken was fine but there was nothing particularly spectacular about it. Repetitive here but again, 0 sides. Like literally a slab of meat on a plate. Didn't try the salmon but it looked pretty. Truffle fries were yummy. Sauteed spinach was way too buttery (big shocker) and the side of mushrooms couldn't have been blander. It was button mushrooms, sauteed in butter (WOAH) with not enough salt.

3.0,10/1/2014,"We had a very disappointing experience at Charlie Palmer Steak. They probably would have gotten another star if the expectations (and prices) hadn't been so high. They probably would have gotten one fewer star had they not given us free desserts. Let's start with the service; just the facts:Arrival - 7:32 pmFirst Course - 8:49 pmMain Course - 9:45 pmAnd the server re-checked my order twice.I don't know if they were understaffed or what, but the place was not super busy.Oh, and they put us at a table that was too small for our party size.Oh, and it was crazy loud when we got there. Died down when everybody else left.The food...Look, the food wasn't terrible. Nobody got food poisoning. Nothing was inedible, but for an $110 per person meal, I expected better. I tasted the following:Tuna Tartare - The worst of the bunch. The sauce was oily and flavorless. It tasted like it was drenched in olive oil. I can't swear that it was olive oil because the flavor was somewhat masked by soy and other sauces, but it was actually a bit difficult to eat.Brussels Sprouts and Bacon - All the bacon was at the bottom of the dish and the whole plate seemed a bit under done. Given the current popularity of these little sprouts, I'd think a place like this would have higher standards.Mac & Cheese - This was actually quite good... quite, quite good. Had I ordered a large plate of Mac & Cheese, this would be a five-star review.30-day Dry Aged NY Strip - It wasn't a terrible piece of meat, but it wasn't transcendent, it wasn't the best I've ever had... It was a little tough, it was cooked a little more than requested - more medium than rare - and the juiciness just wasn't what I was expecting.To their credit, they realized that the service was crap and gave us 3 desserts on the house. The deconstructed, whipped cheesecake was good. The fruity sorbet-y thing was excellent. The cobbler was not great.",3,0,0,Stephen S.,"Coral Gables, FL",15,68,0
5.0,9/12/2014,"We went to Charlie Palmer's new steak joint last night. The vibe in the dining room was jazzy-casual and fun.Our server recommended the clams casino which were quite fresh and juicy, rather than dreaded in bread crumbs -  they were super-tasty. We also ordered the king crab legs which were amazing. The texture was on-point, not fibrous from being previously frozen multiple times. For entrees, one of my colleagues asked for the tuna without salt or sauce. They obliged and cooked it rare. She said it was beautiful. My other colleague order the pork chop which they cooked perfectly, not overcooked - I tried it, it was delicious. My dish of Colorado lamb chops  was simply out of this world, I felt like I was back in rural Spain. The texture of the lamb was amazingly tender throughout the chop with an incredible natural earthy flavor: effin' good and well worth every penny.For sides, we had green beans which were good without too much butter or salt . The Jersey corn side was really tasty and the mashed potatoes were decadent. For dessert, the cheesecake pudding was lighter than I expected and flavorful. We had a few bottles of red wine which were served at a proper temperature - not too warm - they were awesome! I'm not a wine connoisseur, but my colleague was impressed that the wine list had so many interesting options.We will definitely be back. It's refreshing to know that a well-known chef is living up to his reputation. The intriguing menu is supported by obviously high-quality ingredients. kudos!!!",1,0,1,Eric S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,40,0
