5.0,4/11/2019,"My fav Indian food in the city. Period. I love their dinner menu, their buffet, their desserts, and honestly just thinking about it all is making me hungry I've ordered their lunch specials as well and although I prefer the buffet, the food delivered has been consistently fresh and soooooo good.Chicken Tikka Masala: delicious! Creamy and just perfect. I prefer mine extra spicy.Tandoori Chicken: classic, done so well I daydream about itNaan: fluffy and buttery and incredibly goodI hope the mgmt keeps up the quality/service and doesn't take shortcuts like so many other desi spots.

5.0,3/29/2019,My first time at the Darbar Grill. The food was delicious and the service was first rate. I had been craving Indian food and this place fulfilled my craving in a big way. Our server Simran was fantastic. I would not hesitate to return.,0,0,0,D A.,"Portland, OR",0,3,0
5.0,3/12/2019,"Had the buffet and it was seriously one of the BEST meals I've had in a long time. All the food was flavorful and perfectly spiced.  Excellent selection, 10 or 12 hot dishes. Salad bar, and delicious desserts.  Excellent service. Restaurant was very clean and attractive. Unbelievable deal for $14.95.  Went at 2:00pm on a weekday and there were plenty of seats... surprised it was not more crowded considering the quality of the buffet? Can't wait to go back again!",0,0,0,Tom L.,"Hudson, NY",1,176,0
3.0,3/10/2019,"Darbar was a solid Indian dining experience. Came here on a Sunday lunch but we decided to order a la carte rather than the lunch buffet. It wasn't very busy, only three other parties, with background music playing on the overhead. It's a casual/business friendly setting you could go for an office lunch or take a friend out for Indian food. We were waiting less than five minutes for our food when a waiter came up and tried to rush us for the bill, probably thinking we were eating the lunch buffet, and it was an awkward two minutes when we had to explain what already happened. I ordered the house specialty eggplant bhartha curry while my friend ordered paneer makhani along with garlic naan. The basmati rice is cooked very well especially compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to, and the naan was warm and dotted with garlic bits. My eggplant bhartha came with a slight spicy kick that grew as I ate, which I enjoyed very much but it could've been spicier. I tried the paneer makhani and it was very creamy and a bit more than slightly sweet. In the future, maybe I'd like to try the lunch buffet special for a greater range of offerings. It's a narrow restaurant front, so be careful when entering the lunch buffet area.",0,0,0,Diane J.,"New Haven, CT",354,68,292

4.0,2/21/2019,"Went for the AUCE buffet and wasn't disappointed.  The chicken tikka was a little dry, but we went after 3 and it was probably sitting there for awhile (the place was practically empty).  Nonetheless, it was wonderfully flavorful, kind of spicy which is a plus in my book!  Pieces seemed to come from tiny chickens but it was delicious!  The chicken makhani was excellent!  The sauce was tomatoey and buttery tasting, with a slight kick.  The curry goat was tender, and nice sized pieces.  Tilapia in curry sauce was quickly replenished as we couldn't find any fish, and was tasty.  Fresh hot buttered naan was brought to the table.  Saag paneer was good, and was probably even better had we arrived sooner, but no complaints.  There was a peas and potatoes dish which was ok, and vegetable korma which was not bad.  Overall I enjoyed this meal a lot and look forward to eating there again soon.",1,0,0,Robert Z.,"New York, NY",15,24,30
5.0,2/13/2019,"These are the reviews I most enjoy writing, where I can wholeheartedly say that I had a wonderful experience at Darbar Grill. The food was quite simply excellent, I would argue it was the best garlic naan I have ever tasted. What struck me most, however, was the kindness and genuine service I experienced, thanks to the manager Vishnu. He was kind and enthusiastic to recommend dishes. If you want high quality Indian food coupled with outstanding service, Darbar Grill is the destination of choice.",0,0,0,Amanda G.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,0
4.0,1/20/2019,The buffet is great! I don't think you can find a better price for such verity in this area! The quality is also great. I loved the fish curry and also the first time I ever had fish at an Indian buffet and it was awesome. However I would've liked some more appetizers. A lot of vegetarian options and the choices of desserts were good too.,1,0,0,Jannatul S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,22,51
3.0,1/18/2019,"Darbar offers a pretty solid lunch deal but if you're looking for the best Indian food in town this isn't it.Lunch is a buffet option with a bunch of dishes to choose from. Settle in at your table, grab a plate, and go to town. Everything they serve is pretty standard as far as Indian food goes. Tandoori chicken appeared to be a big hit and I loved that they had curry goat. We loaded up our plates and returned to the quiet second floor (we were a large group). The curry goat was the best part of my dish. I just wish it had some spice (it had none whatsoever). The tandoori chicken was okay but I've had far better elsewhere. The rice did it's job of being a side. The naan that was served to the table was warm and fluffy.Service here is hit or miss. Granted all the waiters do is give you your final bill and your drinks but they barely said a word to us. The buffet works out to $15 for all you can eat which is why this remains a solid lunch deal (especially for Midtown East). I just wish they had more dishes offered in the buffet itself and I know a lot of people can't handle spice  but those of us who can would appreciate more flavor in the dishes.",0,0,1,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",421,1576,174

3.0,12/29/2018,This place is a hit or miss. Was here a few weeks ago and the food was great. Went back again and the food was so so. Also the back of the restaurant where we were seated needs some extra lighting. Hard to see what you are eating. Finally be careful- they add on 20% tip for parties of six or more without asking you. I find that offensive. As a matter of fact they are getting more business when more people show up. So what's up with this automatic 20% tip business ? Surely this must be illegal. Tip is something i should give if i want to. Anyway I had to bring it down to 18%. So watch out.,0,1,0,SydVicious V.,"Red Bank, NJ",0,41,0

3.0,12/18/2018,"I decided to walk around and try and new spot as I always do when in NYC. I decided to try Darbar and it seemed promising. But walking in was a different experience. It felt like I wasn't too welcomed. Other than that I had the chicken tima misala, the chicken was over cooked, and the sauce was below average. Maybe the food is fresher during lunch..",0,0,0,Mai Q.,"Oak Lawn, IL",5,28,17
4.0,12/18/2018,"This is a hidden gem in Midtown East. Good Indian restaurants may seem like a commodity in NYC, but this one differentiates itself by offering a vast menu of Indian food options. My go to choice is chicken tikka masala and the chef did not disappoint. The entree has rich flavor and spices as one would expect. The rice was included and I opted to get the butter naan along with it. Servers are great and it is certainly a wonderful date night spot. During lunch they offer an extensive lunch buffet and a to go box if you are looking to grab and go. The funny thing is that the server puts things in your to go box instead of you doing it. I personally find that strange, but maybe some dude overpacked his to go box with CTM? In any case great place. If you do decide to eat here the servers expect a tip for the buffet, but throw them a buck or two and just fill up.",0,0,0,Dipesh R.,"Evanston, IL",199,123,48

4.0,12/14/2018,"Came here for their lunchtime buffet. We were all STARVING when we came in for lunch around 2:30pm on a Friday, and the place was pretty empty. The chicken tikka masala was beyond satisfying, and the paneer had a decent amount of cottage cheese blocks. Probably my 2 favorite things there. Overall pretty satisfied, but do think the price of the all you can eat buffet during lunch time is higher than some of the other Indian buffets we went to.Lots of variety to choose from - lots of chicken and if I remember correctly, there was also goat meat. The flavors were on point. Would definitely come back again. Great buffet to go to if you're ever starving around lunch time and want to just stuff your face.",1,0,0,Rebecca S.,"Potomac, MD",1,25,38

1.0,12/5/2018,"This review is not even about the food, because what occurred before even ordering made us not dine here. I was there Sunday, Dec 2nd. I did research on the place, liked what I saw here and on their site, but to be extra cautious, I called the establishment to ask if it's cash only (like other restaurants we came across). A gentleman let me know that they aren't cash only. I let him know, ""Great, I'll see you soon then!"" It's about 9:00-9:15pm. The restaurant closes at 10:30pm. My bf and I arrive and the host comes and tells us we can't eat there since there's only 2 of us. We have to do takeout or delivery. Great, there goes our dinner plans... if this is how the business is run, why is there no warning of this on their site? Why didn't the person who answered the phone let me know this when I said, ""I'll see you soon, then!""?Definitely not cool. Especially since there was over an hour left until closing!

I personally tried the paneer makhani and chicken korma, both of which were of gourmet quality. The only complaint I have is that for the price, you're really not going to get much meat so I wouldn't recommend eating here if you're starving or looking for a big meal.

Served a cocktail and given recommendations from both the wait staff and manager. The two of us shared a chicken curry, and the chef's special chicken malai!

4.0,4/24/2018,"We were staying at the hotel nearby and chose this restaurant based on the pictures and reviews on Yelp. And we were not disappointed! The staff was really nice and welcoming, the restaurant was beautiful and clean. The waiter was very friendly, explaining the dishes and ready to make any changes requested. One of our requests was to make dairy free Saag (Paneer is ok, just no cream) and the waiter said it's possible. Unlike other restaurants where they say everything is pre-made, no changes possible. Definitely a good sign!The food was delicious! As an appetizer we had delicious vegetable (potatoes and green pea) samosas with tasty roasted bell pepper sauce. We had garlic naan (hot, crunchy, soft and delicious), regular naan (thanks to Yelp check-in), Chana Masala (so good but I wish it had more sauce in it not just chickpeas) and Saag Paneer (without cream). The waiter was so nice, he advised us that it will be more spicy as there won't be cream added, which was totally okay with us. I would prefer if Saag dish was little bit less oily and thinner, however it was delicious. My only complaint would be that my usual ""side of cucumbers"" (that was initially forgotten about) that usually ranges from $0-$3.00, turned into a $6.00 plate. Even the whole English cucumber is $2.50 or less. So I feel like they overcharged me here. On the bright side, my husband also loved the food here and we will be returning.

4.0,4/8/2018,"Darbar Grill is serving up Indian cuisine in the heart of Midtown East. the space is not fine dining, but not casual. it's casual classy: perfect for hosting office lunches or dinners, scheduling date night, or introducing newcomers to South Asian foods. the main dining room is on the first floor. the bathrooms are on the second floor where there's and additional dining area. the bar is on the first floor and is fully stocked, not a lot of top shelf...but to be honest when i'm out for indian food...i'm focused on food not cocktails.the menu does a good job of hitting the authentic notes while still leaving room for friendly exploration by newcomers to Indian food. i had dinner, here, recently and enjoyed several dishes thoroughly. the food is not prepared too spicy, so those who fear their mouth being on fire...fret not. the dishes have some kick and if you want more heat/spiciness just talk to your waiter. entrees were/are fairly shareable between two people unless you're super hungry. food-wise i'd recommend:lamb seekh kabah (entree)--spicy minced lamb served skewer style, accompanied with a flavorful sauce. three kebabs. easy to share. tasty and meaty. perfect for carnivores! the tandoori grill menu is done really well here and should be ordered from...eggplant bartha--eggplant cooked in tomatoes and spices. savory. not too spicy. perfect with the basmati rice that comes with each entree.dal makhani--black lentils cooked in tomato sauce, cream, and spices was another winner. and if things get too spicy mid-meal, just order some raita aka cucumber, mint, yogurt sauce...that'll cool your mouth off quick. bypass water that only makes things worse.there's a nice selection of beers here to pair your food of with...and of course they have wine, booze, and mixed drinks too.didn't save room for dessert...next time.service? attentive. friendly. accommodating. tip well. in terms of price for dinner? it's not cheap, but you get great food and service in an modern chill ambience. i will say the bathrooms need to be renovated and updated. they feel old. and sorta smelled bad bc they are old-ish. only reason why i am not 5-starring Darbar.drops mic cuz i'm going BACK TO THE GRILL AGAIN for lamb kebabsi outzzz",17,8,14,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",458,772,32909

Fair Warning:  my palate is just that...my palate.I burned through the 'meat dishes' and then moved on to the vegetarian dishes.  One dish struck me.  Phool Maknah. As I ate it, the dish itself was slightly sweet, which I love.  But it was the ingredients that challenged me.  As I ate it, I felt there were small grapes or pearl onions in the dish.  I asked to find out more about the dish, and I learned that it was puffed roasted lotus seeds.  Having never had this, and this was my Aha! moment.   Soft, chewy and full of flavor from the sauce, these lotus seeds are a perfect vehicle for adding texture to a dish.  I love new experiences!They had a mango pudding for dessert which helped me finish the meal nicely.... and then I was full.I may not be back to this restaurant, but I was definitely happy for the experience and the chance to try the new dish!",14,7,11,Steven U.,"Honolulu, HI",1200,277,2395

Like I said, they made it extra mild for me which I appreciated. Even without the spice, it had a ton of flavor. There was also a lot of chicken! So much so that even when I divided it into 2 meals, there was some chicken left over. The only thing I noticed was that the description online said ""butter chicken - dark meat"" and it was white meat.

For all that, it's around $10 which I think is really worth it especially in Midtown East. The Lunch Box is fast because they take it directly from the buffet table that they have.

Other places ive tried seemed to use different parts of chicken but this place seemed to use chicken breast thats dry and without the sauce, not much flavor in the actual meat. The naan was on the thin side, i wish it was thicker or came with more servings for the 5 bucks i paid. Im still giving 3 stars but this was a minor disappointment. Id give it 3.5 stars if i could.

That is pretty sweet, considering many places only do M-F. $15 gets you appetizers, entrees, sides and dessert. The two kinds of dal were good, as was the veggie Khorma. The chicken tikka mansala was made with a weird iridescent chicken, that I stopped eating once I discovered its sheen... Pete's favorite was the chic peas and Ground chicken. They offered three desserts, pretty generous I thought: carrots pudding, mango soufflé and the obligatory rice pudding. We didn't have the mango soufflé but the other two weren't bad.

The chicken tikka was the best dish we ordered, and everything else was meh. Also didn't love the setup of the restaurant - ugly fluorescent lighting at the front tables and way too dim at the back. On the bright side, the waiters were accommodating when we asked to move tables because a drunk man was speaking very loudly at the bar and we couldn't hear ourselves think.

The flavor was also not quite as rich as I'm used to elsewhere. I might try something different next time, although there was absolutely nothing wrong with that dish.  The naan was soft and delicious.  I would definitely come back next time I'm in town.",12,9,12,Robert M.,"San Jose, CA",22,12,10

Not only did it taste completely different than it used to, but less than half way through my meal, I suddenly felt sick to my stomach though I had felt fine before and hardly ever have stomach issues.

5.0,7/24/2016,"Darbar recently catered my wedding and they were amazing throughout the entire process. Besides the food being terrific, Mike helped us with wedding planning far beyond what was included in the(incredibly affordable) price and helped us make sure our 100+ guests had a great time. Mike treated us with the same attention that I would expect from a much more expensive affair. The entire wedding was fairly DIY with a very raw space; it would have been hard to pull it off without Mike's attentive help and willingness to answer questions. We emailed him constantly with questions that went way beyond his service, and he always knew what we should do. On the day of, he noticed any problems before they happened and took care of it so we could enjoy ourselves. Service was perfect, the food was enjoyed even by the Indian food naysayers (this was a non-Indian wedding), and everything went off without a hitch. We got so many compliments on the food! Before the wedding, we both visited this location two times and had a great meal both times. Mike and his team also came to the space, way out in Brooklyn, to see how they would set everything up. I still periodically have dreams in which I am eating the beatroot malai kofta--I awake with drool on my pillow.To anyone wanting catering or just a meal, this is your place!",4,3,4,Jesse G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,3

They also usually have goat curry, fish curry, lentils, and a super yummy chickpea-ground meat thingy. My only gripe is I wish the saag/spinach thingy was the kind with the paneer/cheese cubes (it has corn in it instead), but I just get some cheese from the other dishes so it's ok. They serve fresh naan and also have a little dessert bar with flan, mango mousse and watermelon.

Usually I am suspicious of delivery after getting burned by cold food, inaccurate deliver times, and crap portions (I'm looking at you Chinese place that shall not be named). Darbar exceeded expectations-- the food was hot, the portions were huge, and delivery was timely. This could turn out to be a regular deliver place.

A naan bread was wrapped up with the order as well. I was full before I knew it with so much food to spare. The samosas were seasoned well and the sauces were delicious.

And now for food there was huge queue already waiting in for the their turn that too at the very narrow entrance. Dosa was good though. Too much of red color added in tandoori chicken and chicken Tikka masala. Samosa were like frozen ones. Main course has also degraded over the years.

The lunch buffet goes until 4pm! So that's perfect for those night owls who can't get up before noon on the weekends...In any case, the decor itself is nice. I guess the one annoying thing that happened was that when we arrived at 2:50pm during the blizzard, there was one other party there. We were told to sit anywhere we want. We chose a 4-person table at one corner with good lighting. Someone ran over and told us that we couldn't sit there. We asked why, and they said they had a reservation. We asked when. They said 2:50pm. I was going to get angry right there. It was obviously a lie. Who makes a reservation during a blizzard for an Indian buffet at 2:50pm??? In any case, we didn't escalate it and sat at a dark 4-person table. We later brought it up to the manager, and he apologized and said it should never have happened. The buffet itself was delicious. They had your standard chicken tikka masala as well as lamb and fish options. In addition, they had a vegetarian section with saag paneer (tasted different than others I've had...) and some kind of breaded veggie. In any case, all good.

4.0,1/5/2016,"I don't know much about Indian food nor am I the master of all spices, but out of the many times I've visited Darbar, I've never been disappointed.Darbar has a very affordable and accessible lunch buffet for the midtown lunch crowd. It also has very speedy deliveries via seamless. By dinner, Darbar transforms itself to a mcfancypants restaurant. The inside resembles a fine steakhouse: elegant and classy. I'm talking about white table clothes and folded napkins, white gloves on waiters and exposed bricks on walls (haha, if you care). For the price you will pay for the atmosphere and food, it probably has the best value for its location. Indian food isn't that cool with the younger non-indian crowd so you can avoid the annoying hip crowd of izakaya and speak-easy kids. That's a plus in my book.The food is fantastic. I'm a Southern Chinese kid who likes things mild, and there are more than enough options here thats easy on the stomach and tongue, like the salmon curry and the usual chicken tikka masala. The butter chicken serves as a nice American spin if you need to maintain your overweight BMI like me. The choices for naan is plenty. I've only tried the cheese and garlic naan and the regular garlic naan and they're both good. What really hits it home for me is the delicious biryani rice that comes with the curry. I was happy to eat the rice with just the curry sauce with no proteins at all.The service is nice, even though its funny how they switch from formal mcfancypants to super casual gestures sometimes. Sure its not the service you would receive from michelin restaurants but the heart is definitely there.

I'll get back to you. The bad:- Forgot to put the mango in our mango lassi...acted as though we were a burden when we mentioned this to the waiter- Put about 9,000mg of salt in our biryani. When we pointed this out, our waiter said to ""put some raaita on it"" (which of course was another $4)- We really, really gave it a good faith effort, but upon concluding that the dishes were inedible due to salt overload, we notified the manager and he brought out ""new"" dishes after about 30 min and 47 dramatic eye rolls - Meanwhile, overheard at the table next to us: ""are you guys killing the cow back there? It's been an hour""- At the end of all of this, of course we were still charged for the botched mango lassis and biryani--and you know what, that's fine, we ate some (like, 1/15th) of them, whatever. BUT THEN THESE GUYS TOOK THE LIBERTY OF TIPPING THEMSELVES!!!! Are you forreal? Is this real life??!  Is there a way to do a negative tip??? I just had an aneurysm.

I'm a working professional adult, not a retired lady looking to get the clap from a retired man in between ports.But today I was all, ""Know what? Maybe cruises aren't all that bad."" So I went back. I was alone, so they sat me right next to the buffet itself, like I was an item you could put on your plate. That part kind of sucked, but at least I didn't have to walk too far to load up. And guess what? This food kicks ass and if you don't like it then you're a douche. You are whining about the service? It's a buffet. There's not supposed to be any service. There's just food. Just you and your gluttonous ass getting fatter on some excellent Indian grub. I'm not indian, but I recently watched like 3 indian movies right in a row (Apu trilogy, dude), so I feel supremely qualified to tell you about Indian authenticity. Anyway.

4.0,7/10/2015,"Very solid place for a nice Indian meal. Ambiance is wonderful and perfect for date night. We popped in on our way home from work at about 8pm on a Tuesday. There were only a handful of seats filled, but we didn't mind. They seated us in the back room of the first floor in a nice corner table which we loved. This is more formal than a lot of Indian places- white table linens, stemmed water glasses, formal place settings. It was much more elegant than we anticipated and a welcome surprise.We started with the samosas which were pretty typical- hard to mess up a samosa. We also had the Paneer Tikka app which was hands down, my favorite item. It's not doused in sauce, and it is large chunks, or slices, of cheese cooked in a clay oven so some of the sides and corners are charred. First time I've had Paneer prepared that way, and I loved it.We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Saag Paneer with naan. When is naan not awesomely delicious? I preferred the Chicken Tikka Masala which would have benefitted from just a touch more of cream in the sauce. But it was still enjoyable and the chicken was cooked nicely- not dry like I've come across in a lot of these dishes. The Paneer Tikka app was better than the Saag Paneer entree, though nothing bad can be said about the entree. The app was just stellar.

Heat and saltiness were the overwhelming qualities covering other flavors I'm sure must have been there, which made the meal boring and hard to tolerate.

4.0,6/4/2015,"This is what I'm talking about! I was introduced to this place by my bosses. They know my co worker and I are fans of Indian food. And we have also been known to partake in Indian food buffets. We went to this place at like 1:00pm. The place was huge and looked a lot nicer than I would expect from a buffet. When you walk in you are greeted with the man making fresh dosas filled with potatoes and peas. As you go through the buffet line you pick up a dosa. Then work your way around the spread. I spotted the chutney and I knew it needed more than a dollop. I love the refreshing flavor that chutney against the flavors of Indian food. Then there was all kinds of meats that I skipped. I was however, able to scoop a little bit of the fish curry. And then I was pointed into the vegetarian section. I couldn't believe how many options I had for vegetarian food. I packed my plate with paneer, lentils, eggplant, cauliflower and these little garbanzo looking things. As we sat at the table we got a warm plate of naan. We had water glasses filled at the table. The service was great. They kept the water full and would take empty plates as soon as they spotted them. I asked the waiter about the garbanzo looking things. They were reminiscent of little dumplings. My table couldn't figure it out either. My boss said it was ""Flower"" something. And I understood ""Flour"" and it was just a mystery. I asked the waiter, ""do you know what this is?"" and he was like ""I DO know what that is"". The dish is made of lotus flower seeds.  How interesting to go somewhere and eat something completely new. This dish is called ""Phool Makhana""!I fully enjoyed my experience here. And was in a complete food coma. But my boss insisted that we must have the ""Carrots"". I was very hesitant to eat some shaved carrots as dessert. They were delicious and a great way to end the meal. They had a nice variety of desserts.

The place is huge - the main (ground floor) always has a good number of patrons, but for both times I've been to Darbar at this location (I also went for a Sunday brunch) the second floor was completely empty. That being said if you have an absurdly large party this place is more than capable of seating everyone.The décor is nice and would constitute a solid date spot. Despite the main floor being a ground floor I never got the sense we were technically in a mostly windowless (aside from the entrance) basement.The service here is excellent. I felt like there was a mini-entourage of servers tending to us the entire time with water, food, etc. Major props to Darbar for this.I enjoyed my chicken korma. The sauce was as delicious as I'd come to expect from Indian restaurants, and the chicken was tender. And as a bonus when you check in on Yelp here for the first time you get a free order of naan (limit one per table), so be sure to take advantage of that. The pricing ($17) is similar to other Manhattan Indian restaurants I've been to - it would be nice if it were cheaper, but given the location is unsurprising.I have vague memories of Sunday brunch here from a year and a half ago where nothing stood out, but my second trip here was much better.

5.0,2/22/2015,"Last night in the pretty but messy snowfall I decided to treat myself to dinner at my favorite Indian restaurant, luckily for me only a few blocks away from where I live. Greeted by the manager, kind yet ever discreet I again sat at the bar, comfortable nearly to sumptuous in the dark, intimate space, quiet without being imposing, cozy, for adults, and priced accordingly. Feeling fat, I ordered only the Boti Kabab appetizer, and my normal Grey Goose martini. The drinks here are poured well and large; did I have two, or maybe four? They were surprised I didn't have the expected Lamb Vindaloo, and even the charming chef Jon came out to shake my hand. After the fantastic mutton came out, juicy, succulent and spiced to DIE for I was blown away when when I was presented with a lamb vindaloo, compliments of the chef! As always, it was a paradigm of balance, perfect between lamb and potatoes, a hearty sauce not a soup, not thin nor caustically vinegary, nor outrageously spiced but ideal.   Darbar Grill is an oasis of civil and delicious dining Mid-Town East. It is a rare place that caters and takes care of its local upscale clientele, without neglecting New York's more adventurous tourists.    I cannot recommend Darbar more highly.",0,0,0,Eduard L.,"Manhattan, NY",327,14,0
4.0,2/16/2015,"8/10GREAT INDIAN FOOD!!!! Also, nice that we got some free naan from checking in. 1. Garlic naan - on point (2 pieces per order @ $5)2. Chicken tikka masala - got two orders. one spicy, one normal. Both very great. nice amount of chicken.3. Lamb vindaloo - super tender, not as spicy as I would have liked, but it was still fantastic4. sag paneer - wish there was more spinach as we had cheese left over. I guess I like more spinach per bite.We did this family style and they brought out one bowl of rice. We were concerned at first, but they asked once we were halfway done if we wanted another bowl. I am assuming they do this not to waste so much rice. They are very accommodating and quickly come to your service. Nice local indian joint if you are craving some good, authentic indian food. The inside and atmosphere of the restaurant is nice as well.",7,3,7,Tony A.,"Chicago, IL",540,33,22

3.0,2/10/2015,"As Indians living in the US for the past 8 months, we do not go out a lot for Indian food since we think we are pretty decent chefs as far as Indian food is concerned. We decided to make an exception this time and selected Darbar Grill. It was a 1000 point table for the day, so an added benefit.We went on a Saturday night, had reserved a spot for 2 at 8 PM but missed the PATH train and were stuck in the station for 20 minutes. Ended up being late by 15 minutes but called them before we reached and they had no problems moving our reservation. The place was about 50% full when we got there and most of that was also because of this huge loud group on one of the nearby tables.We started with the Reshmi Kabab which was supposedly a restaurant specialty. Usually, these kababs are known for being soft and almost melt in your mouth. This was a new take on them wherein they were a little chewy. Although it was not what we expected, we did not feel disappointed and rather liked this 'twist'. They gave us papaddam alongside which was really good. We also ordered the Mulligatawny soup which was outstanding! Where they really messed up was the mains. We ordered the Lamb Melagu which had a coconut base. When they brought the dish and we dug in, we realized that it had no coconut at all. We had heard stories about not finding the key ingredient in some dishes at some place before this, but thought that we were experiencing it first hand. Except that it did not taste at all like it was meant to. Asked them if they did get us what we asked for and surprise, the server had misheard our order and got us the Lamb Bhuna instead which came in your regular onion/tomato curry. This was surely disappointing. We had plans to order dessert but gave up after our mains order was messed up. They 'compensated' for it by giving us 'extra' rice with our leftover mains. Not a great touch and when there are so many restaurants in Manhattan and it is really tough to make people your regular customers, these things leave a very bad taste. I believe it is a new'ish' place (maybe not reading some of the other reviews but I always find them on OT 1000 point tables) trying to develop a clientele, Our advise to them would be to avoid blunders like this.Overall, I would still recommend the food, but please make sure you repeat your order a couple of times and make them recite it back if you are ordering something fancy of the menu.",0,0,0,Prateek S.,"Toronto, Canada",19,12,7
4.0,2/8/2015,"Speedy delivery AND great food.  Win-Win!!!I ordered a chicken korma and a garlic naan bread and both were awesome.  Korma is very rarely spicy, but Darbar kicked it up a notch.  The portion was pretty big too and came with enough rice to last me a week.  Flavorful, filling, and delicious.The garlic naan was great too and not soggy by the time it arrived at my apartment, a huge plus in my book.  I've read about Darbar many times and always knew it would be good so I'm more than happy it lived up to my expectations.",9,9,9,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",1004,802,3287

There's a nice selection of cold salads (beets, cucumbers) to help cool the palate and they always bring fresh naan to the table to share which is also great!

I don't often eat around my workplace but I'm so glad I didn't have any leftovers to bring to work today because if I did I would have never discovered Darbar. My pal lent me his Delivery.com account and I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (mild spice is perf) with a side of Garlic Naan, and wowsa, what a meal.  The garlic naan was so fluffy and garlicky and left my fingers smelling so fragrant after my meal. The star of the meal however was actually the white chicken breast in my main dish.... How they make chicken breast so juicy, flavorful and no signs of dryness beats me. My meal was almost $20 but could've easily fed two people. I saved half of it for my family, who happily ate the rest. Mom, who works for an Indian-owned 5 star hotel, said the food from Darbar is way better than what the chefs serve at work and supposedly they serve Indian food often.  I will order from here again in the future",6,6,5,Susan N.,"New York, NY",13,90,104

The place was very dark and almost completely empty on a Saturday night, which made us a bit apprehensive, but the food and service turned out to be great, so maybe they just haven't been doing a good job marketing themselves or getting word of mouth!I ordered the salmon tikka masala, since I almost always order chicken tikka masala at Indian restaurants and wanted to branch out a little but not too much haha, and we shared an order of the cheesy garlic naan. The cheesy garlic naan was amazing! If you're a fan of cheese and garlic (as I am) then you will love it and you must order it. It tasted great dipped into my masala sauce. The servers will serve you your dish for you when it arrives, spooning it onto your plate, which made me feel very classy.

Desserts were mediocre - I'd pass on them next time.As far as atmosphere goes, it was perfectly appropriate for a work lunch but nothing special. The waiter was also very attentive. My one disappointment is that I had a soda and a refill and was charged $3 a piece.

We enjoyed the laccha parantha, but the poori was greasy and bland.

5.0,4/5/2014,"The table service was unexpectedly posh, and this easily ranks in the top Indian restaurants I've been to (outranked only by Etoile de Kashmir in Paris, tying with several others). I'd call this 4.5 stars; the pakoras were a little heavy/greasy compared to what I'm used to, and if they were prepared with chickpea flour, it was not identifiable as such, missing that subtle proteiny umami-ness of besan. But once out of the fried foods arena... The chicken korma was very good, the sort of food one hopes for if not always able to expect; the dum aloo was very tender and well-prepared, though its sauce was not my favorite--sort of astringent, perhaps to balance the sweetness of the potato stuffing? But I appreciated the theory of it. But the winner is the beetroot malai kofta. Completely unexpected, like nothing made of beets you have ever had, almost meaty in density, well-spiced and perfectly balanced. To round out the review, the rice and naan were exactly right, though neither were epic. I will be dreaming about the beetroot malai kofta.",15,14,14,Merrie H.,"Saline, MI",28,14,20

To me, it was like a dal masoor with big chunks of boneless white chicken meat.

And once again you steered me right with Darbar Grill.Went with a friend on the early side - 5pm -on a Saturday, and we weren't alone for long. My friend ordered the mulligatawny soup which she felt was too spicy; I tasted it and didn't get any kick from it but it was excellent. Very flavorful!We then shared chicken korma, the eggplant house special and garlic naan. Each dish was delicious; the chicken was tender and the sauce slightly more curried than when I've had this at other places and I really liked it. The eggplant was outstanding; it's a tough vegetable to cook because of how it absorbs oil and dishes with eggplant are often greasy as a result. This wasn't at all and the spices were at a perfect level, not too little or too much. The naan was also perfect.The amount of food we ordered was justs right for two people to share (papadum at the beginning too).

I'm also a fan of their mango lassi ($6). Another plus is that they have dessert included in their lunch buffet. Desserts normally include mango pudding, rice pudding, and watermelons. One negative is the Saturday lunch buffet. They definitely scaled back on the selection of food during the weekend. There are items they have on the weekdays that were missing on the weekend. I would not return for Saturday. Tips: Bathrooms are on the second floor. Total for two lunch buffet came to $50 (including tax, tips, and two mango lassis).",5,4,3,Zhi Man H.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,51,45
4.0,11/9/2013,"I love watching my dad eat. Being exposed to nothing but Asian cuisines and bad cruise ship buffets, he really had no idea what any other cuisine is. Instead of trekking down to Chinatown for mediocre dim sum , my fiancé and I decided to take my dad out to try some Indian food. Since my dad is a big eater and I wasn't quite sure what he would enjoy the most, we decided the best way to go was a buffet. I did a fast yelp search and found darbar grill 4 stars + in 5 mins walking distance. We arrived around 12:30 and there were only 3 occupied tables. We worried initially as we were being seated that the food wouldn't be fresh/had been sitting. But after a taste of my first plate, I was ready for second, third and fourth plate! Every dish they served at the buffet station was delicious. I'm not much of a meat eater but I couldn't help but kept returning for more fall off the bone tandoori chicken and the super tender chicken tikka masala! The cauliflower stir fry, fries potato?, and yellow daal complement the meat. And I couldn't help but try all the sauces at the pari pari station. My dad loved their goat curry so much that he had 3 full plates along with extra sauce to go with the toasty buttery naan they brought to our table. After 3 plates of amazing savory goodness, I went on to try the 3 desserts - caramelized pudding, mango pudding, and the dough in syrup? I found the caramelized pudding and dough to be a tad too sweet. instead I went back for second serving of mango pudding and then ....some more tandoori chicken hehe 13.95 pp before tax and tip lunch buffet - definitely a great deal especially with the quality and its location - my hood! Who needs to trek down to Murray hill? Or Gramercy? Service was so on point too - constant water refill and every time I returned to my table, the plates were already cleared.

Chicken samosas ($6). Basically just a samosa shell filled with ground chicken.  I was expecting the chicken to be mixed with something but it wasn't.  The chicken was dry but I liked the shell.  Putting the chicken on top of our paneer app was great and enhanced both apps.Butter chicken ($13, includes rice).  The chicken was tough and dry (albeit white meat) and the sauce was far too tomato-y for me.  I thought this was the biggest missNaan ($5). Really good. Poori ($6). Basically tasted like fried dough you get at a carnival.  I've had it other places where the ""fried"" taste is less overwhelming and I prefer that.If you check in on yelp you get free rice pudding for dessert (1 per person even if only 1 person has the Yelp app).  They also have loads of 1000 point tables on OpenTable.",3,0,1,A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",856,1301,8

5.0,7/4/2013,"Darbar Grill is probably my 1 of 2 favorite Indian buffet places in Manhattan. As my brown friends have told me, if you want to go Indian, GO LUNCH BUFFET. You get a variety of flavour profiles, textures, meat vs veggies, etc. Here are the reasons Darbar remains one of my top 2 GO TO Indian places in Manhattan (I've been here 12+ times):(A) The flavors/spices aren't dulled. As one of my culinary friends recently said: you can TASTE the freshness of the spices. Doesn't mean the food is necessarily HOT spicy, just not dulled down by salt, sugar, fat, etc. (B) I guess the word that comes to mind is ""excellent"". A good number of the dishes are staple dishes, but they just manage to do it better than everyone else. (C) Nice variety of meat, veggie, etc. dishes(D) They bring out fresh naan (a sign of a good buffet)(E) Convenient location, friendly staff.(F) Exceptional food for reasonable price (Indian lunch buffet prices are all within that 10-15 dollar range, pre tax, pre tip)(G) More dessert choices than any buffet I've been.If you're in the east/mid 60s during mid day, go to Darbar Grill.",10,9,10,Dan Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0
5.0,6/30/2013,"This place is worth writing home about. The food here was spectacular. Some of the best Indian food we've tried in the city, and we've had some in Curry Hill, Prospect Heights, and elsewhere. The service here was outstanding. And it's always a good sign to walk into an ethnic restaurant and see multiple families of that ethnicity dining and enjoying their time there.

3.0,6/13/2013,"We had the Okra Crunch as an appetizer, I have had it before at other Indian Restaurants and have come to enjoy it.  Darbar's take on it we did not like.  They slice the okra up into strings.  It was flavorful but difficult to eat.  Too small to use your hands and too cumbersome to eat with a fork.The food was good but nothing that will pull you away from your usual place.  I did like that they offered to ""tune"" the heat for you.  I like mine a little spicy and they accommodated nicely.  I have received strange looks when I requested changes at other places.  Our server asked me if I would like it spicier when I ordered.  It was a welcomed surprise.The service was not that good.  I was at a business dinner so maybe they were trying to give us our space.  Seemed like I needed to cal them over for every need.  They did fill up the complimentary beverages without us asking but our main server was invisible most of the time.Darbar won't impress anyone but if you want a good meal at a good price it will fill the bill.  Not anyplace I would go out of my way to get to.",0,0,0,Rick S.,"Tioga, TX",1,9,0

For our entrees we had chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, and some sort of lamb chops. The chicken vindaloo and chicken tikka masala were both very good, and spicy (like we ordered). Not the best chicken tikka masala in NYC but still very good.Only negatives were that the server didn't know anything about the happy hour; even though there was a sign outside.

Everything was great and most dishes were very flavourful without being too hot.

The waiters were attentive with copious refills of our water glasses and for those of us who still had room there were 4 or 5 dessert options - more than I am used to in other buffets.

When arriving at my hotel with the food I felt that the Saagwala was really pretty uninspiring.  the amount that they served what enough for two.  The Naan really suffered from the block and a half walk as it was a bit soggy when I took it out of its tin foil, understandable.

Always get those little burning hunks of love oh andd an order of GARLIC NANN, which came in a basket with a tissue paper type liner--more on that later.The food was good. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty damn good and came out steaming hot and we were starving and wet so it worked out.  Def get the Chicken Tikka and Vindaloo, and Samosas :)This places tries to be really fancy I think. I mean it is, right?  Well they have white table cloths, goblet glasses, silverware preset on the tables and wine lists.  I guess I'm just not into the whole fancy scene, after a slight quarter life crisis, I'd rather be eating take out indian in central park but that's neither here nor there.

Well... a small fire started on our table.  I looked over at Matt and all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye, I notice a bright orange flame dancing on the basket of delicious garlic nann. Apparently the flame on the super-romantic- ambience-creating-candle somehow caught the basket of nann on fire. It was f------ hilarious. That was the highlight of my dinner, sad I know.Or maybe the highlight should be when they half-way brought us a birthday dessert thinking it was one of our birthdays, only to turn around after seeing our confuzzled stares and placing it on the table next to us?

With all the above caveats, the food we did try was fine, nothing special.  It did nothing to redeem an otherwise horrendous dining experience.  Never coming back here - blech!",1,0,0,Marina D.,"Manhattan, NY",5,52,0

In fact, I asked to take the leftover sauce home even though we finished the dumplings, and I thoroughly enjoyed it on top of rice for lunch the next day!The eggplant dish is a puree that packs a punch. It is the right kind of acidic, and it goes great with some naan.They have a solid chole (reminds me of chana masala) and vegetable korma as well, but those don't require the same description because hopefully everyone knows what those taste like. The ambiance was much nicer than many Indian places-- a lot of them cater more to take-out customers and don't have much dine-in appeal but Darbar is very classy.The service was excellent and they even brought out a rice pudding on the house for us to share.

1.0,7/5/2012,"I was shocked that I was able to find a not so amazing restaurant in NYC. During my trip in June 2012, I was convinced, I couldn't throw a stone without (1.) Pissing off a New Yorker, and (2.) Hitting an outstanding restaurant. Guess what... found one that was below awesome. Now before I proceed, I just want to emphasize that this was ONE visit, ONE dish, ONE time deal. I am sure that any restaurant can't be this ""bad"" all the time, so it goes without saying that although this place may be YOUR favorite place to eat, in my most humble opinion, this was my worst experience in New York. Perhaps just bad timing. The GOOD: a decent, and affordable house wine. Yeah, that was pretty much the best of the whole deal. A Chardonnay that didn't leave an acidic rash in the back of my throat.The BAD: the service was NOT bad... simply, awkward. I didn't understand why there was so much commotion with the servers walking back and fourth, looking at us, helping us, over helping, then walking away... I was lost. The restaurant is pretty much dimly lit with candles. I mean, where am I, Outback Steakhouse? It was really dark inside, especially when you enter the dining room on the lower level in the back. Sure it was a great feel.... if you're on a date... but I was just trying to get some good Indian eats with a friends - not trying to get romantic. When the food came out, it looked really amazing (from what I could see in the dark), but then when I ate it, seemed surprisingly dull and flavorless. Indian food, without flavor? I don't know what went wrong. The server also weirded me out with an awkward gesture... he brought out a spare plate, then rice, then my dish, and started to put rice on the empty plate... confused, I said... thanks... then he said he would come back and put more... ummm... okay? He walked away, and never returned. I didn't understand why I needed three dishes to eat my one meal...Like I said, it was awkward and I was lost, maybe that's the norm in New York Indian dining... I dunno...OVERALL: definitely has turned me away from trying them again. Plus, I live a quarter of the world away, so chances of me stopping in to give them another change is ... pretty much a no and never. I state again, that this was just my ONE experience, and judging by other people's reviews, and their happy hour, Darbar should be an awesome little dining experience.

5.0,7/3/2012,"Darbur Grill is just delicious!  I went with my cousins on a Friday night.  We arrived around 5:30 PM, which was early for the restaurant.  The restaurant was quiet and had a cozy feeling with dark wood and it had a nice sky light in the back room where we were seated.   The service was very attentive.  Our waiter kept bringing menus with no papers inside which was funny.  He had a good sense of humor and laughed it off.We ordered drinks right away!  Each one came in a tall glass with lots of alcohol.  A definite plus after a long, hard day at work.  For our appetizers we ordered the vegetable samosas.  Yum!  Crispy and hot with two different dipping sauces.  The tamarind sauce was sweet with a little bite to it.  For my entree I had the Mint Ginger lamb chops. I was so pleased.  They were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  So good!  The 3 chops were served with a side of jasmine rice.  Very good!  The waiter made our first plates which was different for me.  It was a nice touch.Since I checked in (yelper all day), we received a free dessert.  My cousins picked a carrot cake souffle.  Very good!All in all it was a great experience. I will definitely be back sometime soon!",6,3,4,Cortney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",652,433,1393
5.0,7/2/2012,"So delicious!  And the service was superb!  We had garlic naan, tandoori chicken, chicken curry, palak paneer, and cassata for dessert.  All was absolutely delicious.  The ambiance is quiet and dark with white table cloths - great place for a romantic dinner or even a business meal.  (On a side note... Even though the ambiance and decor was upscale, we did not feel uncomfortable in our casual clothes.)  They have a nice bar and the upstairs would be great for a private event.  We'll definitely be back!",1,0,0,Michelle N.,"Cheyenne, WY",1,28,20
3.0,6/29/2012,"We came here at the end of their lunch buffet.  For a buffet the quality is pretty good and, after some reminders, they brought us plenty of fresh (although overly greasy) naan.  As others have mentioned, the chicken tikka masala was by far the best part of the meal.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was well spiced (but I'm white, so you have to take that with some salt).  The rest of the food ranged from pretty good to just ok.  Nothing horrible but not a lot of standouts either.  The service was also pretty lackluster, but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that's because we came so close to the end of lunch.",0,0,0,Denis S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",753,2076,21

The ambiance is romantic, upscale but very unpretentious. Our hostess sat us immediately and a server immediately came by with water, chutney and naan. The portions are huge and it is reasonably priced. I had the chicken vindaloo which was perfectly spicy and so delicious that even though my mouth had started to burn, I kept eating more. The Rasmalai dessert was very refreshing as well.Our server was friendly and checked on us frequently and there was always someone to clear our empty plates right away.

2.0,6/24/2012,"I went here once a few years ago and I remember liking it, but I went today for the buffet and it was not good. The food itself was.....I did not finish my first plate and for the first time in the history of the world I DID NOT GO BACK FOR SECONDS. This is unheard of for me at an Indian buffet. Usually I have to leave the restaurant slightly hunched over because my belly is so full it's painful. Sooooo yeah. This was an exceptionally bad buffet. And I asked for water as soon as we sat down and I waited a few minutes, looked over and saw the waiter having a leisurely drink by himself behind the bar. I was so sad. And then he waited a few more minutes before bringing me water and I was so thirsty. When we were leaving, an old lady was yelling about how they said they would put out more salad and chicken twenty five minutes ago, and they still hadn't done so.Also, when I set the serving spoon back down in the kheer, it slid into the container. I apologized to the waiter and explained that I dropped the spoon in, and then he stuck another spoon in there.....and just left the first one sitting in the kheer?? Just.....it was a very odd experience with pretty poor service and bad food. I've never before seen Indian food that I did not want to eat. It was crazy.",0,0,0,Kelly R.,"Minneapolis, MN",10,289,44
2.0,6/17/2012,"The food was pretty good but the service almost gave me an anxiety attack. The servers were SO aggressive and eager to take our plates away and box up our food even before we had finished eating.

5.0,5/30/2012,"About one of the best Indian restaurants you will find in NYC.As fate would have it, I usually wind up in this part of midtown east every few months or so on personal business around late lunch time. The buffet lunch is one of the best (and freshest as well as most hygiene-conscious) that you will find in any Indian buffet. The dishes offered for buffet are nothing short of exemplary and paradigmatic, despite the fact that this is buffet lunch. Chicken tikka masala on a buffet is no short order, and the vegetarian dishes (spinach and cottage cheese, daals, potato stews, et al) are no slouches either. The goat curry, though on the bone as with most places, is sublime.Even at two in the afternoon everything was in the right freshness zone; nothing tasted as if it had been out for hours as an afterthought. And after numerous late lunchtime buffet visits, this is always the case.And onto dessert. A damn good fresh brewed coffee (again, hadn't been in a brewpot since 10am, thankfully) to accompany the dessert buffet. Solid flan and a near-perfect Gulab Jaman (not too crunchy and not over saturated in rose-honey water) rounded things out nicely. On a very pleasant ending note, entire bill with a 25% tip for impeccable service was twenty bucks. And worth every sou, quite frankly.For me it's comfort Indian food 'til I'm old and grey.....",1,1,1,Mi H.,"Highlands, NJ",0,2,0

5.0,4/18/2012,"Walked about 10 minutes to Darbar Grill for a weekday lunch buffet and was not disappointed.  Buffet consists of 5 protein dishes, 5 vegetarian, 5-6 salad items, and 5 dessert/fruit.  When I got there at 11:40 am, I was the first customer.  More people came in through out my stay there, but it was never really crowded.  Usually I go to Indian buffets to load up on proteins.  But Darbar's vegetarian dishes were so good, I ended up eating them more.  After two plates of overflowing deliciousness, I had to go back for another half-plate of veggies...yeah, it was that good.  I told myself I shouldn't have gotten the 3rd plate, but I finished it anyway.  My favorite, the goat dish, but watch out for bones and bone fragments.  A helpful hint for yellow daal, use the dessert plate/bowl to hold it since it was soupy.  Then, it was to dessert.  After I scooped rice pudding, mango pudding, and flan, I suddenly realized there was gulab jamun right behind other desserts, hidden in a metallic buffet dish.  I panicked a little as my tiny plate/bowl was already full.  A solution came in mind, I took what I had back to the table, finished them, came back and got an awesome gulab jamun on a new plate....crisis averted.  The only problem after this epic culinary adventure was that I was too full to walk back at my usual NYC speed.  I suffered the humiliation of several tourists actually slowly passed me by as I limped along.  But, you know what?  For this great satisfying lunch, it was totally worth it.",1,3,1,Ken T.,"San Diego, CA",7,28,0

The complimentary pappadom was also good. The entrees were the highlight of the meal, we sampled chicken korma and vindaloo (this was very spicy but good). The entrees had huge chunks of chicken that were moist and tender. The meal was a little pricey (av. $16/entree), but very enjoyable.

During our last visit, the owner was kind enough to offer us complimentary dessert (which I must say was the most creative Indian dessert I have ever eaten in my life - layers of gulab jamun, flan and a cookie! - their chef has to be a genius to invent that).

We really liked that Darbar offers whole wheat naan and ordered a trio of them (one with cauliflower, one with mint and one very simple).  They were all fluffy, light and delicious.  It was hard to keep from finishing them all off.As for the entrees, let me start with a warning; the portions are very ample and two people might be able to share one dish.  We enjoyed Chicken Tikka and a lamb stew.  The Chicken was flawless and you could cut it with your fork.   The lamb was equally irresistible.  We also opted for a vegetable side of Eggplant Bartha which wowed us.  Service was affable and efficient and the meal was more than worth the price.  I'll be glad to return to Darbar soon.",3,1,1,Chris C.,"New York, NY",218,367,17

The food is really great, he had minced lamb, and the quality of the meat and the preparation were simply impeccable.  Again, the wines we tried have been fantastic yet somehow they are $9-10 a glass.  This just made me think in horror of my drinks at Circo the other night, the sister of Le Cirque, an Italian place that NEVER serves wines at proper temp; I paid $25 for a glass of red there, after trying at least five different wines, and it was awful.  So I would rather have the $10 Italian (!) wine from Darbar than any wines from Circo.The service was exceptional.  All in all a great place, it seems a bit empty at times which saddens me a little, I really hope they are here for the long haul.  I can't find any fault with this place, except they have a terrible entrance, it looks like a hole in the wall, if I did not have a certificate incentive, I would never in my life have entered the establishment. It looks drab and cheap and awful right up front, they really need to update.

The staff was OK the first time, didn't explain the dishes so well and weren't able to confirm allergy concerns either. The second time I was here service was much better and more attentive, maybe because we were a bigger party - bigger tip. The enterior and decor feels very dark and I feel there needs to be more light in the restaurant. The portions are good and the presentation on the plate is well made. I've only had the chicken with mango here, so can't comment on any other dishes, however this dish was very tasty and my main impression was that everything tasted very fresh with the right amout of spices and only fresh mangos.

4.0,1/29/2012,This would be a five star review if it wasn't for the price.  I know this is Manhattan but I can't afford a place like this often.First of all the place looks pretty new and has classy environment.  Now what makes this place truly stand out is their service.  This place might have one of the best service that I have ever experience.  My water was never empty and I was treated well even if I didn't order much.  I usually tip based on how often my glass is empty because it shows how much waiters care after you get your food.I started with the chicken samosa which was great.  Their chicken samosa had a lot of chicken in it which is not usually the case at other places.  The best samosa I never had with my limited experience.  It was good enough that my girlfriend ended changing a order of garlic naan to vegetable samosa.  The waiter was very nice about changing the order which is a huge plus.  The vegetable samosa was also excellent.My girlfriend and I shared only one entree of Chicken Tikka Masala because we were on a budget and I had eaten at another place already.  This was a bit of a surprise to the waiter when we ordered only one entree but they didn't push us to order something else.   The Chicken Tikka Masala was also good but doesn't stand out when compared to other places.  We also had an order of garlic naan to go with it.  The naan was really good and came close to perfect.I ended up taking the chicken tikka masala to go because we were too fully.  They were very nice about that too considering the fact that one of the waiter had to run upstairs to get the containers.I would recommend this place to anyone who has the money to spend on this place.,2,2,2,Charlee L.,"New York, NY",0,50,7

Hot glistening naan bread to top it all off.  There was a whole separate table of desserts but I was too full to try any of them, or even to check them out.   Next time I will try the goat curry and a few other things that looked good.  In any event,  I know I won't be eating dinner tonight.  I can't wait to go back to Darbar.",5,4,4,Bronwyn B.,"Long Island City, NY",176,166,10

I saw lobster tikka masala on the menu and I could not resist. I have never seen it before so why not? It was plated beautiful, the lobster shell sort of acting as a bowl for the yummy masala lobster goodness. The sauce was divine. The best flavor..the lobster was a little chewy but...the sauce made up for it. My boyfriend got a lamb chop dish that was really tasty too.

1.0,10/17/2011,"Awful experience at this place. (Thanks Yelpers, you guys let me down this time). Being that I have not had Indian food since I was a child, I thought I'd try out a new place. I'm not an expert on Indian food at all so I did a small amount of research on some food terms, ingredients, and things like that. I looked at the menu the night before and I planned on doing the tasting menu so I could have a bit of everything. Now, I do have a nut allergy but none of the dishes on the tasting menu mentioned any nut ingredients so I was happy about that although I planned on asking when I got there. So the next day I went there and we were greeted by a caucasian (perhaps Russian) blonde haired, blue eyed hostess. Weird. I should've known something was wrong then. Anyway, when we were ready to order I told the waiter I wanted to do they tasting menu, but even though it is not noted here, are there any nuts in any of those dishes. Well he said, ""Oh, this is going to be a problem because there are nuts in everything on the tasting menu. But do you want me to ask the chef?"" So I said, ""Yes"". He also said how the whole process was an hour, to which I replied, ""Well it is seven courses isn't it?"" So he came back and says the chef said everything on the tasting menu had nuts. At this point I was irritated because it was hard for me to believe that all 20 or so dishes had nuts in them. So I chose the basic lamb tikka masala- guess what? The waiter said that had nuts in it too! At that point I asked him to show me anything on the menu that did not include nuts. He actually said everything did. At that moment I thought that they did not want to serve me for some reason because they were not being accommodating at all. I think the waiter sensed my frustration and offered to ask the chef if he could make me a special sauce. How nice. I ended up having lamb tikka masala (or lamb whatever), naan, and raita. The lamb dish was hot and I basically had to drench it in the raita. We then had to wait forever for them to bring the check, and no one said thank you for coming, etc. Actually I think the hostess may have said bye but it was in Russian. I'd say skip this place. They are rude and VERY unaccommodating. I also don't believe all 100 dishes on their menu contained nuts. Total waste of money.",0,0,0,Fashionist A.,"New York, NY",2,60,3

5.0,8/15/2011,"I came here last Saturday, definitely in the mood for some good Indian food. It was fairly easy to find The restaurant is dimly lit but does not feel overwhelming. For appetizers we had the bhel poori, the crunchy okra and the samosa chaat.The okra was great. I've had this at other places before, but I thought this was absolutely exquisite. It's fun to have that as an appetizer especially if your a fan of okra.They were all delicious and we pretty much finished all of the appetizers. The bhel and samosa chaat were both perfectly seasoned and the portions were decent sized and not too heavy. A lot of Indian restaurants OD in some area of the dishes, whether it's the sauce, the portion size, or the spice, and this was all actually perfect.For our entrees we had the beetroot malai kofta and the lychee kundan pasanda. I absolutely loved both. I love malai kofta and it was cooked really well; wasn't tough, broke very easily with a fork, but stayed in tact in the sauce. I've never had beetroot malai kofta before. It was uniquely tasty and next time I don't plan on sharing this with anyone! The lychee pasanda was actually not too sweet and perfectly spicy to my liking. I need to learn how to make this dish at home ASAP.We also had the onion naan, and that was made perfectly. I don't even like to eat a lot of naan with my Indian food, but I could not keep my hands away from the naan OR anything else for that matter!We brought back leftovers and when my friends had them the next day they also said they were great. They could not stop raving about it, and I know they are very picky about their Indian food as well.There is an upstairs which they can use as a banquet hall, or for parties. Maybe that is where they serve their lunch buffet, I'm not sure. The place is really nice, intimate enough for couple and fun enough for big groups. I can not wait to bring my family from out of town here when they come, I know they will be impressed.If your a fan of grade A fine Indian cuisine, I would definitely suggest you try this place immediately!",9,7,7,Bunsy S.,"New York, NY",182,144,1

I really want it to be better but for its just ok. Indian should not be bland and many of Darbars items are. Like the chicken tikka masala which creamy but lacking in flavor and spice. Darbar does seem to do naan right. It's always been made to order, chewy inside and crispy with ghee melted on the outside.

We found Darbar after an afternoon of walking the hot streets and stopped in for the lunch buffet based on the continuous positive reviews I had read on Yelp. Winner! Wonderful variety of hot and cold dishes, very fresh and plentiful. The chicken tikka masala was out of this world and the naan was chewy and delicious. For $12 it was easily one of the best deals I've found for an all-you-can-eat place.

As the age old phrase goes ""you get what you pay for"". this food was weak and uninspiring. the tiki masala was beyond bland and made with ALL dark meat!

4.0,5/30/2011,"I went to Darbar Grill with my family after graduating from medical school.  We had a bit of trouble finding the place because the listed address was not the same as the actual address for some reason.  The food at this place was very delicious and quite pleasing to the Indian-American palate.  The Okra Crunch was a great appetizer if you even remotely like okra - flavorful with just the right amount of crispiness.  For the entrees, we ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer Makhani (not on menu), and Chole.  The entrees in general were pretty standard dishes, but hit the right spot when you need them to.  The plain naan was a bit overcooked, but the onion naan's really hold their own.  For dessert we ordered a couple dishes of Kulfi as everyone reminisced about how great Kulfi is at Chowpatty Beach in Mumbai, India.  I really enjoyed this Kulfi but the elders were steadfast in their loyalty to Kulfi in Mumbai.   The service was polite, attentive, and prompt.  Overall, I had a very good experience at this restaurant!",5,3,5,Vick P.,"New Milford, NJ",80,58,16

4.0,5/4/2011,"This is a review only for the lunch buffet. As far as Indian buffets go, this is the best place I've ever been.I love the various cold salads that are part of the spread. I don't know how authentic beet salads are when it comes to Indian fare, but it was delicious. Other salad options include corn and cabbage. Since I'm a vegetarian, I can't speak for the meat dishes, but I didn't feel deprived with the salads and the five or so hot vegetarian dishes. My favorite of the hot buffet dishes was the paneer makhani, although it and the vegetable korma and dal seemed a little watery. They were all flavorful, but their consistencies could have been creamier. I also like that the servers bring hot, fresh naan to the table instead of just leaving it on the buffet table where it could get cold and tough.The dessert selections are good, too. Sadly they didn't have gulab jamun the day I came (my dining partner, a repeat customer, says that's his favorite dessert in the buffet) but I am always a sucker for flan/custards. There was also a mango mousse, cubed watermelon, and rice pudding.Come around 11:30 and the food is at its freshest, and you won't have to wait in line to load up your plate.",3,2,2,Jessica W.,"Buffalo, NY",34,374,188

4.0,1/1/2011,"I haven't explored many Indian restaurants in NYC to compare, however, this place is consistently great for delivery. (I haven't eaten at the location yet, so this is a delivery based review).Where I give/remove my stars: +1 Star for the always friendly young man answering the phone. Most NY restaurants are in such a hurry that they rush you off the phone asap just to answer the next call, yet he is always patient when answering questions and takes the order with grace.+1 Star for the consistently fast and reliable delivery. Rain or shine, I always receive my order in less than 45 minutes and it's stored so well that it still tastes great. The delivery man is always very friendly and polite as well. (Also, sometimes fried foods or breads don't taste as well if not eaten directly at the restaurant, but so far at Darbar Grill, the Samosas arrive crispy and the Naan arrives fresh and warm). +2 Stars for the consistently good food. I've tried a few different things on their menu, but still always order a few staples just to have them, and they are all always yummy. Even people who don't prefer Indian food have fallen in love with their food, including the daal after just one taste. (If you like daal, the big hit is their regular daal, but they also have the yellow daal if you ask for it, and it's good).-1 Star, for continuing to give me unwanted plastic utensils. I know it's not a big deal for everyone, but recycling/living green is important for me, so I have to knock down a star. Every order arrives with plastic utensils, napkins, and even plastic plates, all of which are the non-recyclable kind. It might come in handy if you do happen to need them, but since I don't, it's unnecessarily wasteful. I do tell them I don't need them when I place my order, but there's some sort of communication problem with the kitchen, so hopefully soon they'll realize they could save some money (and prevent waste) by not providing them. Anyhow, until then, it loses a star.",4,3,1,Charlize T.,"Austin, TX",54,79,4

3.0,5/20/2010,"Ok, so I need to admit first off that I am an Indian food virgin. Besides the Indian wedding I attended a few years ago, I have not had any Indian food since- weird, because I reallllyy like food and eat out a lot! So anyway, my friend Marina G. suggested this as a start start-out place, and it was. I was also able to get a 25 dollar coupon for 2 bucks from restaurant.com. It was 2 couples, $66 per couple, after the coupon, so not a cheap place, just a bit pricey but we ordered a lot! I am definitely a fan of the Cheese and Garlic naan (the butter one not so much), I thought the Chicken Tandoori was ehh, as were the Chicken Samosas, but I am honestly not a chicken fan. I really liked the Lamb dish (wish I couldnt tell you what the name was -  it was super tender) and the vegetarian dish with the lentils and beans was pretty good as was the Meatball beet thing (Mala Keftka...haha ...so now you see I am really an Indian food newbie). Anyway, I tried to remember the dishes but it has failed but that just means I have to give it another try- I could definitely see being into Indian food. So Marina asks the waiter to make our dishes ""not white people spicy, but Indian spicy""...well for me it was wayy too spicey (newbie reference again) , I guzzled down 5 glasses of water in 30 minutes and the Martini that at first tasted super strong, tasted like pure sugar at the end of the meal compared to all the spices in the food. So long story short,  1) I am glad I started my Indian food journey here, 2) I will definitely order ""white people"" spicy next time I go and 3) I'd recommend giving this place a try - I myself am thinking about coming back for the lunch buffet one day . P.S. Those sugared herb thingies you take on your way out - wowzers my mouth tasted like perfume til the next morning, like someone like poured half of a bottle of cheap perfume in my mouth..weird but I heard they help with the digestion and let's say I definitely needed help with that..",0,0,0,Lana K.,"Rego Park, NY",117,237,0

The Potato Croquettes with Goat Cheese were unexciting. I expected the Garlic Naan to be tinged with the flavor, not overpowered by it. The bread arrived coated with the crushed vegetable, giving it a bitter, even unpleasant, taste. My entrée, the Goat Bhuna, was nowhere near as flavorful or delectable as the Lamb Melagu I finished off with ease last time. I got through two pieces and pushed the dish aside. It fared better with the drinks. The Mumm Taj, which comes in a tall glass, resembled a spiked smoothie. The Pomegranate Martini, which I asked them to tone down a bit during my order, turned out nice.  The servers were so attentive, they were verging on obsequious. They were trying so hard to keep us happy, resorting to pleasant chit-chat to keep us engaged.

4.0,1/10/2010,LUNCH BUFFET  --- This is the reason why you go to Darbar Grill.  This place takes the traditional stock and trade of most Indian restaurants and elevates it to a slightly higher level and thus the reason it has a large loyal following and is typically packed.The items on Indian lunch buffets tend to all taste the same after awhile and Darbar Grill is quite successful in avoiding this trap.  Overall larger variety than I am used to seeing on an Indian lunch buffet with many types of cold salads and all the condiment sauces one could desire.  I supposed the made to order Dosa station is an added plus though I can't comment as I was stuffed from the buffet itself.  The large variety of desserts is another place where Darbar Grill shines and hopefully they are aware of this fact and will maintain the large desert offering (I overheard one woman saying to her dining companions that she was glad they got there early that particular day because all of the desserts would still be there for them to try so clearly it is an aspect of the buffet that others enjoy).Darbar Grill could probably do pretty well being all buffet all the time as they seem to have mastered the concept and execute it fantastically.  If you have a group of more than 3 go earlier rather than later as this place fills up almost instantaneously.,0,0,0,T.

My only gripes with the service here was that none of us were in a mood to drink alcohol, but our waiter kept trying to push a bottle of wine on us on at least three different occasions, SO PUSHY. Step off dammit! For starters, we ordered something called Bhel and Meat Samosas. The description for Bhel said that it would be some kind of rice puff, but when it came out, honestly it looked like a really bad ball of crispy Asian noodles with some rice crispies stuck inside. We hoped it was more appetizing than it looked, but it was not. The meat samosas were average, but a bit dry inside. Next time, I think we'll go with veggie samosas instead. For entrees, we ordered Chicken tikka, Tandoori mixed grill and Chili chicken. The chicken tikka was absolutely delicious, I wish I had gone with my gut and ordered that also, because I ended up taking all of my friend's dish! The tandoori mixed grill comes with chicken, salmon and something else (I forget). This place really knows how to cook their chicken, perfectly spiced and not dry at all.

Despite this, we had a wonderful meal trying the appetizer sampler (which was kind of on the small side for the price) and the Chicken Saagwala and Chicken La Jawab - both amazing and large portions with jasmine rice.  Have also tried this place for take-out/delivery and it was quick, with a sizable portion.  Took my parents to the daily lunch buffet for $10.50 which was phenomenal - great variety!  The waitstaff is super attentive and friendly.  On our first visit, the owner spoke with us about the liquor license issue and told us the story of how they are waiting - they now serve beer/wine but are still waiting for the other.  The atmosphere is classy with dark wood floors/furniture, but its a little drafty/chilly...Love this place - definitely worth a visit if you love Indian food.",3,0,1,Karen M.,"Long Island, NY",25,43,0
5.0,1/10/2009,"This place has some of the best Indian food I've ever had, period.  For starters, my wife and I shared veggie samosas, which come with a delicious sauce of the chef's own creation (highly recommended).  For entrees, I had the chicken tikka marsala and my wife had the fish moilee.  The chicken in my Tikka Marsala was very tender and the sauce was as good as I've had in any other Indian place.  My wife thought the fish was very tender, the sauce was delicious, light, not oily, and very well done.  To finish, we shared a bowl of Kheer, which was sweet, delicious, cool, and smooth going down.The waiter service was exemplary.  The waiters were extremely attentative (in fact, the waiter responsible for refilling our water may have been TOO attentative, but better that than the opposite), friendly, and helpful.  Once we were done with our meal, they switched to European style service- they leave you alone to sit, talk, and digest until you signal someone for the check.The restaurant is also not without ambiance.  They have two floors, each of which are fairly spacious.  The decor was simple, but tasteful, and the lighting was low, creating an intimate atmosphere at our table.  Of course it also helped that the restaurant was (surprisingly) empty at ~8pm on a Friday night.Lastly, the price was right!  Without alcohol, our total for an appetizer, two entrees, and a shared desert came out to about $60.I highly recommend this restaurant, which stands out even in the face of other good restaurants (Shun Lee [Chinese] and Ginger [Japanese]) located steps away on the same block.  Also, be on the watch for their Sunday buffet- we haven't tried it yet, but we eagerly anticipate enjoying an all-you-can-eat buffet for $10.95 with food of this quality!",0,0,0,George S.,"Boston, MA",0,3,0
