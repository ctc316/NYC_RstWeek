3.0,12/31/2018,"Came here for the second time for dinner a couple weeks ago. The service is definitely lacking for a Michelin restaurant. We were seated in their back dining room. We had the burrata to start which is a difficult dish to do poorly. We asked the waiter for entree suggestions but he then ran through basically the entire menu which was wholly unhelpful. He continued to say our choice in entree just depended on our mood (""duh"" I would not ask for suggestions if I knew my choice based on my mood). Additionally, the service was just choppy and disjointed. The entrees took quite a while to come out and we had to ask for the check multiple times. The food tasted exactly as expected but nothing special. Not worth the Michelin pricing and far better one Michelin experiences in NYC.",2,0,2,Pheabe C.,"San Francisco, CA",33,90,228
5.0,12/23/2018,Great restaurant! Food was delicious. Staff was polite and knowledgeable about menu items when we weren't sure what to order. Also a beautiful restaurant. The octopus was very delicious!!! Would definitely go again!,0,0,0,Diana M.,"Manhattan, NY",137,1,0
5.0,12/21/2018,"The entire experience here was just lovely. We got to the restaurant and had a drink at the indoor bar while we waited. The bartender was a delight. He chatted with us and when I inquired about two different beers he let me try them both. Once we sat down, the waiter was very patient and happily sat through all the menu questions we had. He explained everything thoroughly. The food was delicious. They served us bread (important!) and a super yummy butter. We had such a fun time trying the different foods. Everything was great, they were all meals we've had before (buratta, bolognese) however they made it different and delicious. The dessert was SO good. We got the tiramisu which was great, but we got another dessert (can't remember name, it had Fernet in it), and it blew us away. We were so impressed by this dessert. The one thing I would say is that it took them a little longer than expect to seat us, even though we had a reservation. However, we sat at the bar with the kind bartender and made friends with the people next to us, so it wasn't bad.",0,0,1,Aldy F.,"New York, NY",272,22,32

5.0,11/25/2018,"Went earlier this year with family who selected the restaurant. Nobody can argue it is a beautifully designed space, and the variety of food and service was wonderful. We ordered a LOT of food to share between six people and honestly every single item was amazing. While it was definitely not cheap I would say it was well worth the price tag, and a lovely experience.",0,0,0,Sara V.,"Manhattan, NY",7,94,7
4.0,11/14/2018,"Came here by recommendation from a friend as a good place to go for a special occasion. First impressions, like many other reviews mentioned, it took a while to get our menus after sitting down, which left moments to be awkward as we tried to look for a server who could finally help us. $55 for a three course menu which is fairly priced in my opinion because the food definitely did not disappoint! Quality, taste, atmosphere were all A+.Called ahead and requested birthday service for our special guest, the person on the phone asked for the name and promised to make a note of it for our reservation but unfortunately when we got there it was like that phone call never happened. We read later on that the restaurant is closing soon, I do recommend coming by before they close, but make sure you have the rest of your night free because we definitely spent 2.5 hours here!",0,0,0,Liam C.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",204,157,261
5.0,11/8/2018,"I first came for Summer RW 2018 and thought the experience was decent. After hearing they'll be closing at the end of the year, we came back for the Fall 2018 menu. And because we find any excuse to be in the Meatpacking District! La Sirena is a beautiful space, right underneath the Maritime Hotel, decked out in swanky modern decor, mosaic tile flooring, Edison bulb chandeliers and towering florals in vases.Over 2 visits, some of the dishes excelled, while others were just fine, so they don't deliver on all fronts. Burrata Caprese was excellent, mildly salty, flavorful and creamy. The Fall version with butternut squash caponata was good, but I found the caponata to be too cold. Calamari with chanterelles were nicely done and flavorful. Octopus with potatoes and pistachios were a mix of perfectly done and overdone. Not consistent, but the potatoes and pistachios had a great kick and provided a lot of crunchy textures.Lamb Chops Puttanesca was 3 baby lamb chops, more well-done than the medium I'd requested. The flavors were good, but for so few bites, they should've been perfectly done. Double-Cut Pork Chops both times were much better dishes. The pork was cooked perfectly, and toppings were bright and vibrant. The Fall version with chestnut and cabbage kraut was delicious, with bold Austrian-German flavors. A friend's dry-aged Tomahawk Steak was a hefty price tag, but surprisingly bland. Plenty of Maldon sea salt had to be sprinkled on top, and they also brought over a bottle of aged balsamic vinegar to boost flavors.Duck Breast was very rich, with Chianti poached pears over celery root purée. The skin could've been crispier, but the duck was nicely done. Their Pasta Bis is served tableside by 2 waiters, simultaneously doling out the pastas to every diner. Spicy Black Spaghetti with lobster had a nice kick and also rich from the lobster butter. My preference was the waiter-recommended Orecchiette with lamb sausage and broccoli rabe, creamy and delicious. But both pastas could've benefited from longer cooking times.Service both times was what topped the evening off, exceptional by every standard, from a well-trained waitstaff. Kurt and Evelyn were superb! Kurt provided excellent menu suggestions and checked in on our table constantly. Evelyn was sweet and cheerful. Overall this restaurant has a lot to offer with its dishes and service, so catch them while you can!",11,4,13,Katie L.,"New York, NY",266,260,706
2.0,11/4/2018,I don't actually know who gave this place a four star ratting. Who ever it was obviously eats at crappy restaurants. Upon entering the most unfriendly host I've come across in years ! The place is nicely done but the service is on the lines of maybe a fast food chain although the waiter was pleasant just not very attentive. Dirty appetizer plates were left on the table until I had to ask they be removed . As far as the food goes it was nothing out of the ordinary! I would say mediocre at best . Upon leaving we came across Mr. personality once again who didn't acknowledge us at all and didn't bother to look up from his reservation planner . Do your self a favor and don't bother !!!!,0,0,0,Allen D.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,1,0
4.0,10/31/2018,"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and the food was delicious! We both did the three course and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable as well.I ordered the prosciutto appetizer and he ordered the fluke crudo -both were mouth watering! For the second course we also had great experiences with the pork pappardelle and the lamb chops. Super filling and well made. Lastly, we went for the mango ciao and gelati (coffee, hazelnut, and chocolate). I would definitely recommend this place for a tasty and filling meal The only thing that was confusing about this restaurant was the ambiance. First, we went for a Saturday dinner and the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, so I was really confused about that. The space is also so much bigger than it needs to be with double the seating outside as well. It was really modern but dimly lit and I want to say it was intimate, except the space was just so oddly big that it was kind of uncomfortable and I was questioning whether it was a good restaurant for the first half of the dinner due to its emptiness. Basically the food was good but the ambiance could have used some work.",1,0,0,Amanda G.,"Boston, MA",246,80,117

5.0,10/19/2018,"Absolutely loved it. Of the 4 restaurants I went to this outing that were Michelin starred, this was the one I had the least expectations. It had the fewest number of stars, but it completely blew me away. I had the benefit of being in a group of 4, and we got the 3-course PF. This was great since we got to all try different things. The stand out dishes were the fluke crudo to start, spicy black spaghetti for the main, and the banana cup for the dessert. The octopus appetizer was also good. Steak was also good, but not Peter Luger good. The restaurant was perfectly patronage when we were there - operating at full capacity without a giant throng of folks waiting at the entry. This is the perfect place to bring the parent-in-laws, they punch above their weight when considering the cost - came out to just under $100 pp all in.",3,0,1,Morgan C.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",5,125,60

5.0,9/18/2018,"Rating: Food:  Although we had the lunch menu, it was terrific. The mushroom and cheeseburger was the best burger we ever had. Calamari was also delicious and gave you different kind of sauce instead of marinara. Desert was delicious as well, but the best dessert was the mango gelato desert, it's to die for! Cocktails: Specialty cocktails were terrific, but the cocktail topped with the gold was especially good. We also liked the frozen cocktail. Atmosphere: Walking to this atmosphere, you can either come solo or a date you want to impress. They have a nice long bar as well.

4.0,9/3/2018,"Went to here with my girlfriend on a whim, we went to Buddakan across the street and it was so loud that we had to leave. We sat out on the balcony with a few other couples and have dinner on a beautiful night. The waiter was very attentive, the food taste very good, but there could've been more. The place was clean, I thought the management staff was also very attentive. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the place, not sure if I'll go again, just because there's so many other places in New York to visit.

3.0,8/23/2018,"I came here with a couple of friends for Summer Restaurant Week dinner. I was interested in checking out the restaurant because they have a Michelin star, notable chef and the Restaurant Week menu included the entire menu (with surcharges on the more expensive items). My friends and I dined in the Bar Room which was absolutely lovely with romantic dim lighting and had a modern, sleek elegance. The place had an intimate ambiance and the booth seating was incredibly plush and comfortable. The majority of the space with black and white with red accents.We were served baguettes with salted butter, which was quite tasty and satisfyingly fluffy.For my appetizer, I would have gone for the calamari but it was grilled, not fried. So, I selected the Casella's Prosciutto which came with snow kiss melon (similar to winter melon) and arugula. The prosciutto was wayyyyy tooooo saltyyyy. Even when I tried to eat it with the bread, it wasn't enjoyable. I was allowed to choose a different appetizer, so went for the Eggplant. The description the waitress gave sounded so nice. The dish was comprised of crispy fairy tale egg plant (the only part that I liked), carponata, mint and farro puffs. There were only 3 of the crispy egg plant and the rest of the eggplant was submerged in a sweet and sour olive sauce that really turned my tastebuds off. Should have just chosen Verdure (salad) - That would be hard to mess up, right? I got to try my friend's Burratta Caprese and Octopus with potatoes and pistachios. Both were far better than mine. The Burratta was served with tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon. That mozzerella cheese drizzled with olive oil was yummy, creamy cloud-like perfection. It was a beautiful, light summery dish. The octupus was quite flavorful, soaked in the juices but was a little tough. The potatoes were nice and perfectly sauteed. For the entree I was trying to decide between the Lamb Chops Puttanesca and the Double Cut Pork Chop. The sauce that accompanied the lamb chops didn't sound that appealing to me so I ordered the pork chop. Luckily one of my friends let me try one of her lamb chops. It was slightly charred on the outside which I liked and the meat was tender and full of flavor. However, it was only 3 lamb chops so the portion size was small. My dish had 4 large, thick pieces of pork chop, with a mix of  pancetta, onions, red and yellow peppers, as well as a sprinkling of scallions on top, along with this amazing basalmic vinegar sauce. The pork chops were perfectly cooked with crispy edges and tons of wonderful seasoning. My other friend ordered the massive 48 oz porcini rubbed bone-in ribeye, dry aged for 40 days, which was an additional $100. The server brought it out on a chopping board with bushels of rosemary so we could see what it looked like uncut. Then they sliced it into bite sized pieces and brought it back out with some onion and peppers side. It definitely should have come with french fries though. My friend's assessment was that it wasn't flavorful enough and she had to add quite a bit of salt, pepper and sauce to it. I don't think it was worth the extra money.I was interested in trying the Budino di Cioccolato, which is chocolate pudding with caramel, sweet cream cloud and ameretti, but I was too intrigued by the Mango Ciao, which is olive oil cake with hazelnut crema and lime. The cake was disappointingly small, but at least it was super adorable, with a perfect scoop of mango sorbet (that looked like egg yolk) in the middle. The olive oil cake was so lovely and moist and the sorbet was very refreshing with strong taste of the fruit. Inside the cake was the hazelnut cream, which was made out of real hazelnut - Very delicate, rich and not overly sweet. I would have liked to have much more of the hazelnut cream though. Our waitress was Evelyn and she was awesome. She knew the menu well and could speak to how each item is prepared and what they taste like. She made sure we were taken care of throughout the night and was very friendly, gracious and understanding. The service provided by some of the other individuals at the restaurant was not as high quality. My friend had to ask 3 different times to speak with the manager until the manager finally came over. Then, when it was time to pay the bill, it took forever even after my friend had informed them that she was in a hurry and had to leave. I might come back someday to try some of the pasta, but it won't be for awhile.",12,6,8,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876
5.0,8/20/2018,"We managed to get a 5:45 reservation on the last day of Restaurant week on a Friday night. We were very excited to eat at La Sirena because it is a Michelin star restaurant and definitely a steal for $42/person for Restaurant week. It was very hot and humid outside so we started with a frozen aperol spritz which was absolutely amazing. I am a huge fan of the Aperol Spritz after my recent trip to Italy and this is my favorite take on the aperitif. For our appetizers we started with the Octopus and the Burrata. The octopus wasn't cooked as well as we would have liked but the flavors were very good and paired well with the pistachio's and potatoes. The Burrata was so fresh and delicious. The cheese had a nice crunch from the almonds on top and was served with delicious tomatoes.For our entrees we went with the Ravioli in the brown butter sauce and the Crispy branzino in a cherry pepper butter. The ravioli's were delicious and we got a very generous portion (Couldn't finish). The star of the meal was the crispy branzino. The fish skin was very crispy and was amazing paired with the cherry pepper butter. We had to lick the plate clean!For dessert we went with the Bay Leaf panna cotta and the Mango Ciao. The Panna Cotta was very good and was served with a berry reduction that was delicious. The Panna cotta wasn't as sweet as we were expecting because of the bay leaf sauce they put in the middle. The olive oil cake with the mango sobert was really, really good. The cake was a tad dry but when you got a spoonful with the mango sorbet, pure GOLD.I have already raved about this place to my family and friends. What a meal.",6,0,1,Eli B.,"Queens, NY",10,103,143
5.0,8/18/2018,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here.  Food and service were incredible and everything we would expect from a Michelin star restaurant.  We made reservations here on a Friday night to celebrate our anniversary and to take advantage of their NY restaurant week menu.  I definitely want to come back and maybe sit on the nice patio area when the weather is nice.Appetizers:   We chose the calamari and the octopus.  I loved the octopus dish.  Was crispy and tender without being over cooked.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was a grilled calamari.  It is so engraved in my mind that calamari is fried that I forget about this much healthier version.  Entree: My husband ordered the N.Y. strip and I ordered the Spicy Black Spaghetti.  You can never go wrong with NY strip.  It was cooked a perfect medium temperature and was very tasty.  The black spaghetti though, blew me away.   I had read reviews that it was a popular dish, so I decided to give it a try.  It has a nice spicy kick to every bite and having pieces of lobster thrown in doesn't hurt.  It's black color is due to the squid ink.  I loved it and ate every single bite of this large portion.Dessert:  Tiramisu and Bay Leaf Panna Cotta- Both were excellent.  Tiramisu is a classic and the Panna Cotta had a smooth, mousse texture.  Service:   Our server was so attentive throughout the night and always ready to help with suggestions.  Also, wanted to thank the gentleman at the check in desk for acknowledging we were celebrating a special occasion and going out of his way to give us a nice table.",7,0,0,Jessica M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",87,24,74
4.0,8/16/2018,"Went here for Summer Restaurant Week 2018.Best: OCTOPUS (pickled marble potatoes, pistachio, basil, rosemary) - not a fan of octopus in general, but this was rather delicious.Good: CRISPY BRANZINO PICCATA (cavolo nero, spicy cherry pepper butter) - the butter sauce with this is really tasty. I never had cavolo nero before, it tasted like spinach to me.GELATI (selection of three - I chose coffee, chocolate, vanilla) - this was just okay, I've had better gelato. The coffee flavor was the best, followed by the vanilla, then the chocolate, which was dark.Good service, except that they forgot my companion's coke. Good thing they didn't include it in the check.",6,0,0,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",46,210,189
2.0,8/15/2018,"My friend and I went on a Sunday and I think this is where things might have gone wrong? It was like the miserable C team that was working. The space itself is beautiful though so I would definitely come back for a drink. It took awhile for the bartender to acknowledge me while I waited for my friend and just dropped a menu in front of me. A smile would have been nice. The male hostess did smile which was refreshing. I know it was restaurant week but we're in the industry and we did all the upgrades and got a bottle wine and champagne before so we spent a couple hundred dollar between two girls. Our server was friendly but I don't think she understood what was going on. We asked her what her favorite pasta was and she recommended some and so we took her suggestions and we ordered a midcourse pasta tasting. We had apps which were not good like the C team in the kitchen didn't take much care and just plopped some food on a plate. Fine. Moving on. Then our entrees come out. I kindly reminded the server of our pasta course and she had forgotten which is fine. But then we were asked if she could just serve it as were eating our entrees which is not what I wanted. So then they sent back the food. The pasta was delicious (yes, saving grace!) I would have forgiven all of this except when our entrees came out I literally think they just put the food back and reheated it because the strip was inedible dried out and almost medium well when we ordered it medium rare (we left half on the plate). Also no manager came by, which would have been a nice touch. I think the entree part really set us off and was a bad representation of their kitchen especially when I love this restaurant group and was excited to dine here. You win some you lose some. Only as good as your last dish.",0,0,0,Jennifer S.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
4.0,8/9/2018,"To be honest, all these 3 star reviews have me confused. Granted, I came for restaurant week, so it was a great bang for our buck -- which maybe wasn't everyone's experience. But what I will say, is that based on the quality of food, the ambiance, and the attentive staff, it should come as no surprise that this place has been honored with a Michelin star two years in a row. Every dish I tried was nothing short of fantastic. Even the complementary bread and butter was spot on. The real highlights for me were the appetizers. We had the fluke crudo and the octopus. The crudo was an absolute *FLAVOR EXPLOSION*. Not gonna lie, I thought my eyes were going to bulge out of my eye sockets b/c I was so shocked by the depth of flavor. And the octopus was perfectly cooked. It had a beautiful charred exterior and it was nicely tender on the inside. It was served alongside a few small potatoes, which contrasted well with the slight crunch of the octopus. For entrees, we had the black spaghetti and the pork chop. The pork chop was a bit too lean for my liking, so I had to rely heavily on the sauce it was served with to add moisture. The black spaghetti on the other hand, shot me up to heaven. I will be thinking about that pasta for months to come. Let's take a closer look: - Al dente pasta? Check. - (A generous amount of) Lobster? Check.- Sauce that's got the perfect balance of butter and salt? Check and Check! It was amazing. I read another review that said Lilia's pasta is better than La Sirena's pasta, and I respectfully disagree. I'm legit considering making another rezzie just so I can eat the crudo and that pasta again. Lastly, desserts. We tried everything on the RW dessert menu and everything was divine. My faves were the panna cotta and the olive oil cake. The only dessert I could have done without was the tiramisu. It was good, but it wasn't particularly memorable like some of the other dishes. Would I come again? Absolutely! But I think I might stick to apps and pastas only. And maybe a small scoop of gelato sorbet for dessert... And maybe some olive oil cake too...",7,0,2,Alexis Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,33,21

5.0,8/3/2018,"We came here for Summer RW '18 and I was blown away by every dish I got. Exterior: Large establishment with plenty of outdoor seating right by Chelsea MarketInterior: Beautiful modern decor throughout with plenty of dining room and bar seating. Food: CALAMARI: more than just squid! Though not actually fried, the squid came with beautiful morel mushrooms in a very fine potato puree contrasted with the acidity/sweetness of the balsamic vinegar. Many thanks to our server who suggested this dish (especially since morels are apparently only in season for a short while more). DUCK BREAST: definitely worth the extra $10 for RW! Fatty, but crispy skin, atop tender, moist meat. Looks undercooked, but definitely did not taste that way. The livery foie gras added great depth to the flavor of the duck. The charred carrots provided a wonderful smokiness and the cherries balanced that out with a much appreciated sweet twist. Despite the generous portion, I could not get enough of it!BAY LEAF PANNA COTTA: a savory dessert that still ended the meal on a sweet note. Interesting flavors and doesn't take a foodie to appreciate it. I was a bit put off by the pistachio biscotto though, as it was placed on top of the panna cotta. To break it off, I had to either remove it entirely or smush the panna cotta. Flavors were interesting together but did not entirely complement each other. It was delicious nonetheless. I also had a taste of the eggplant, spicy squid ink spaghetti, and the tiramisu, all of which were delicious as well. Service: staff was knowledgeable, attentive, but not overbearing. It was thanks to our server that I got calamari, one of my favorites of the night. Overall, given the price, which came to 52, not including tip/tax, I highly recommend this place!",10,0,2,Jenny C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",175,79,200
4.0,8/2/2018,"God do I love restaurant week...perfect excuse to splurge at a michelin star restaurant. The dining room is quite spacious, with a stylish and modern decor, great service, and (for the most part) tasty food!There is a $42 and $72 menu, the difference being that in the latter choice, you get to choose both 1 pasta dish and 1 non-pasta entree. Of course, I elected to go with the $72 menuFor starters, we went with the calamari dish and the eggplant dish. The calamari had perfect texture - firm, but not too chewy. They give you a few different chunks featuring different parts of the squid, and it went well with the balsamic sauce. The eggplant dish uses fairy tale eggplants (love them because they are just so much tastier and not as bitter as other eggplants) - some of it is fried and crunchy, the rest of the eggplant comes as a caponata, which was also tasty.For pasta, we went with the spicy black spaghetti, and pappardelle.The spaghetti itself was cooked to a perfect al dente, but aside from some heat and a heavy basil flavor, lacked depth of flavor and was kind of bland. The pappardelle on the other hand was great - almost a silky texture with a sweet and rich bolognese!Next came the diver scallops and lamb chops. The scallops are decently sized, fresh and tender, and are paired with peach slices and plum jam (interesting taste!). However, you only get 3 scallops per dish. The lamb chops were my favorite dish of the night, and probably the best lamb I ever had...it was ridiculously tender and had the right amount of fat...it was almost like eating a perfectly marbled ribeye.For dessert, we had the budino, tiramisu, and the mango ciao (which was complimentary). Honestly, all 3 of these tasted pretty average, and I probably wouldn't order them if they didn't come packaged into the restaurant week menu.",9,0,1,Matt H.,"New York, NY",273,264,748
3.0,7/31/2018,"How does this place have a Michelin star? Despite having a great reputation in the NYC dining space, this place was nothing beyond average.

4.0,7/31/2018,"Me and my bf went here during the RW, personally we try to avoid this time to try new restaurants even though we really want to. Because it seems like the restaurants often sacrifice the food quality or the service to make up for the loss of profits. But we chose to this one as they are generous enough to let you choose from the regular menu! So why not? It turned out to be a good experience. I got the octopus for appetizer and as everybody here said, it's very tender, personally i feel like it's a bit of too much herbs, but that's just personal preference, it's still delicious. My bf got the prosciutto, I mean it's prosciutto, it can't be bad as long as it's quality meat, but it doesn't beat slicing off a whole leg and just devouring in Europe (yes we do that at xmas). For mains, I had the black spaghetti other people are raving about and my bf got the lamb chop. The spaghetti is good, but not impressive and I think there is kimchi in there? I feel like i could replicate it at home... My bf liked his lamb quite much. The desserts were pretty good! I had the mango ciao, which made from a simple recipe, olive oil cake, some hazelnut cream inside and mango sorbet on top! It was an interesting combo and the presentation was beautiful. My bf had the chocolate one that was very nice and had some creativity too. I think we loved the desserts the best from the courses but we are big sweet tooth people! Also, the interior was nice, we opted to sit on the huge patio which has a beachy resort feel ( many customers were dressed as so too), so it's very casual if you choose to sit outside although I'd appreciate it more if people make some efforts when they go to a nice place. Again, that's just personal preference.",9,0,0,Chloe L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,69,0

Easy OpenTable reservation. The restaurant week menu is available Sunday - Friday from July 23rd - August 17th. The best part is you can choose from their ENTIRE menu (some items do have a supplemental fee) and not the usual very limited restaurant week menus at other places! You get a choice of Antipasto/Appetizer + Primo/Pasta *OR* Secondo/Entree + Dolce/Dessert for $42 per person (not including tax/tip/drinks). You need to choose all THREE COURSES when ordering from the restaurant week menu FYI! Ok enough talking. Onto the food:-OCTOPUS 19(pickled marble potatoes, pistachio, basil, rosemary): This was one of the best octopus dishes I've ever had! It was crispy, flavorful, and so tender! Generous portion got restaurant week. You get 2 large octopus tentacles. Not for the squeamish. Haha A++-SQUASH BLOSSOM 17 (ricotta cheese, white anchovies, parsley, honey): I didn't try this myself since it had fish. However, my friend tried it and said it was really good! N/A-LAMB CHOPS 36(puttanesca, smoked tomato, olives, anchovy, capers): Wow! I wasn't sure what to expect with the anchovy in this, but I decided to take a gamble since I love lamb. You can't taste the anchovy! It adds an umami flavor to the sauce. You get 3 large plump lamb rib chop pieces. No side dish but I didn't mind since I was getting full as it is. Lamb was perfectly medium rare as requested with a lovely sear. The lamb was a little fatty but it adds to the flavor and juiciness. A+-DUCK BREAST 38 *$10 supplemental fee for restaurant week* (foie gras, negroni reduction, carrots, cherries) : Another impressive entree! The duck was a beautiful juicy medium rare. The skin was crispy. The seared foie gras was a nice touch. A smidge salty but not uncomfortably so. I didn't try the carrot and cherries. A+-TIRAMISU 13 (coffee mascarpone whip, chocolate olive oil sauce, pick up sticks): This didn't quite stand up to the stellar quality of everything else. But still a good rendition. You don't taste the olive oil. The pick up sticks are basically just sugar. B+-MANGO CIAO 13 (olive oil cake, hazelnut crema, lime): Moist donut shaped cake, donut hole filled with tasty crema, and topped with delicious mango sorbet and lime zest. Excellent! A+-MULITA PICANTE 16(Avion Reposado tequila, mezcal, Ancho Reyes, lime, ginger beer, Mole bitters): Tastes like a lighter Moscow mule, served with unique hay straws and over crushed ice. Very refreshing! A+-OSCAR-LA-VISTA 16(Smith & Cross Jamaica rum, Fino sherry, ginger, Allspice Dram, lime, jerk bitters): Served with a singed cinnamon stick and lime zest strip on top and over crushed ice. It's very flavorful and strong. Too strong for me. Also it didn't pair well with my meal. B2 complimentary petit fours: -Mini homemade raspberry jelly candy: Reminds me of those soft Sunkist jelly candied coated in sugar from my childhood. A bit too sweet for me. B-Mini pistachio cookie with brown butter and raspberry jam: So good! I wasn't expecting much but there was so much flavor in this tiny cookie! I wished for more! A+ You can also do an a la carte option if you don't want a full 3 course meal. The prices listed above are for a la carte! So restaurant week is a GREAT deal! They also have a 4 course meal for $72 (but requires the participation of the entire table). I was disappointed their summer dessert menu wasn't as interesting. Their recent spring desserts were much more innovative and unique to me.Only thing I didn't like was their white cloth napkins were very linty. My black shirt was covered with white lint at the end of the meal. Not cute! Maybe have a lint roller handy for customers just in case? Everything else was PHENOMENAL! They earned that Michelin star! We will be back for sure (possibly with my lint roller).",8,0,1,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,143,27

Our server was wonderful with what he had to work with. Long story but the food was enormously disappointing. My Orrechiete was ok but not nearly as good as La Bottega's Orrechiete. My dude's Aperol Yellowtail dish was awful, like room temperature tuna sashimi with bad orange soda poured over it. His side of broccoli rabe was inedible, and we had to get snacks from Alaska Deli so he could go to bed not starving.

4.0,7/7/2018,"Went here for dinner with 3 friends, and really enjoyed the experience. Half of our group ordered drinks which received good reviews, despite being a bit expensive. We opted for the tasting menu, which was certainly a good move, given all of us were really hungry.I had the burrata, which was some is the best I've ever had... The shishto seasoning was unexpected and delicious. That was probably my favorite dish all evening. For primi, we had the black spaghetti and garganelli, both of which I'd recommend. The black spaghetti was excellent. For secondi, I had the duck breast. The plate was beautiful and the flavors creative; both sweet and savory, with the foie gras being a nice touch. The duck however, was ordered medium-rare, per suggestion of the restaurant, was a bit too tender for my taste.Overall, service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected of a trattoria. We went on a saturday night, in which the weather was beautiful, so we were able to sit outside. The entire facility was massive, so it never appeared to be busy, but it was hard to tell with so many tables both in and outside.Bottom line, great vibe for young folks, and the food is good, though not great. Tasting menu comes in at under $100, so that's a value buy.

2.0,6/3/2018,"Came here for a business dinner with my colleagues (6 of us in total), via a reservation with OpenTable, on a Tuesday night. They had a lot of open space and the decor of the restaurant was nice, albeit empty.I thought the food was okay - they had a lot of the standard tapas dishes (patatas bravas, octopus, etc.) and paella which was average / below average based on NYC standards. The drinks are definitely better than the food - they have a nice wine list and good cocktails. The most definitely characteristic of this location is the service - or lack thereof. Frequently, throughout the meal, the waitstaff were nowhere to be found and the food took quite a while to come out. The restaurant was half empty when we came in but it still took them ~15 minutes to seat us and when we left it took ~15 minutes to get our material out of coat check (and they had even lost a few pieces).",1,2,0,Radhika G.,"Manhattan, NY",322,64,97

On my most recent visit I had the red snapper entree. The dish had 3 little slices of snapper and some mixed seafood. Portion seemed like it would be ideal for a kids meal. Service is still solid.

3.0,5/21/2018,"A good restaurant with quality food but with some service issues.  We arrived early for dinner with friends and decided to have a drink.  When our friends arrived, our bartender told us the drinks would be transferred to our table (standard practice), and again confirmed by another bartender when we closed the tab.  After being seated, we asked the waiter about our drinks.  He disappeared for several minutes (and even saw him taking orders from another table), arrived back and said they could not find our drinks.  Mind you, we drank less than half our drink, but there was no offer to comp us a round which would have been the right thing to do, and not something we would have asked about -- not classy.Then the waiter took drink orders for the whole table which took a while to fulfill.  As we were waiting for drinks, another waiter came by to tell us about the specials and ask if we had questions.  Then, about 5 minutes later, the original waiter came back and told us about the specials.  It was all very confusing.The food was good -- had the octopus and burrata as appetizers.  Tasted the branzino and lamb for mains.  All solidly put together, but the lamb could have had something else on the plate, some veggies or maybe a mash.Generally, the food was fine but service, so so.",0,0,0,K.

4.0,5/17/2018,"This is a great restaurant with marginal service. Went for dinner and got off to a bad start. One of our party of 4 was stuck in the subway because of the rain, and so they kept the rest of us waiting for 25 minutes and then when she arrived they told us to wait while they prepared our table. The place was only half full so I am not sure why we couldn't be seated or why we had to wait. The wine list is great with some old standards and some terrific new ideas, and there is a range of pricing. However, once seated they forgot to take our wine order so the bottle only arrived after the first course. The waitress also forgot to bring out a couple of drinks during the meal. The food is outstanding and the prix fixe is a great deal. However it comes out of the kitchen sporadically. The meal was unhurried but on one course they brought out our plates before they cleared the old ones, and realizing their booboo, they took the food away. Then we waited for several minutes until they cleared up and eventually got the next course on to the table, luke warm. I am not normally this picky but for a Michelin starred restaurant they don't make the grade. On the entrees, the duck was our table's winner and the snapper was clearly bland. All four of the deserts were amazing, creative, tasty and perfectly presented. Bottom line on this place is if all you care about is what goes in your mouth, its outstanding, but if you are looking for an experience commensurate with the price, be forewarned.",4,0,0,Errol G.,"New York, NY",2,75,0

4.0,3/26/2018,"Somehow secured last minute Saturday night reservations for 3. To be fair, it was an early dinner at 6:15. I'm always hesitant when it comes to Meatpacking dining as it generally tends to be more trendy than tasty, but luckily La Sirena delivered on both counts. We all ordered the prix fixe menu, which included an appetizer, pasta, main course, and dessert. Note that for three people, we could only choose 2 full-sized pastas to be shared. We shared almost everything, so I got to try a lot of the menu. Standouts from what we ordered included the burrata , funghi misti, bigoli pasta with duck ragu, and the duck breast. A few misses for me were the calamari (too heavy and oily) and the red snapper (flavorless).  When the dessert menu came out, we were also pleasantly surprised to find that the choices included a selection of house made sorbets and gelatos, which included flavors such as pineapple mezcal and horchata. Not sure if this is a destination restaurant for me, but I'm glad I got to try it once.",7,1,1,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

4.0,3/24/2018,"My boyfriend and I were literally staying in New York for an entire week for fun, after having explored Maryland (his hometown) and Philly, therefore we needed places to eat.  Aside from a few items New York is known for, such as bagels and pizza, we wanted some more fine dining.  We had been watching a lot of Masterchef at the Airbnb, and funnily enough, my boyfriend stumbled upon a restaurant owned by both Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich.The first impression that I got from La Sirena was it catered to both date night crowds and families.  Although the atmosphere was a bit dark and definitely on the fancier side, it was inviting.  Overall, the service was extremely friendly, and I was very satisfied with how well our server took care of us. We decided to do the set dinner, which included two appetizers, pastas to share, entreés, and desserts.  My boyfriend and I have similar tastes, so it's always fairly easy for us to order.  After basically studying the menu, which is heavily in Italian, we decided on razor clams and a fish crudo (I forget what kind of fish it was) for appetizers, pork bolognese parpadelle and mushroom garganelli for pastas, branzino and lamb shank for entreés, and panna cotta and órale bambino for desserts.I think the appetizers were my personal favorite part of the entire meal.  It was my first time eating razor clams, and they were amazing.  The fish crude was also pretty tasty and light.  I think I preferred the pork bolognese parpadelle in terms of pasta because it was really well-made and savory.  Parpadelle is also one of my favorite pastas.  The garganelli was too heavy in mushroom flavor for my taste and not salty enough.  My lamb was a little overcooked, but the parts that weren't were fall-apart tender.  The sauce itself was pretty salty, but when paired with the sides, it was perfect.  I liked the rugabata pureé a lot as well as the fennel on the side.  My boyfriend's branzino was flakey and I enjoyed the spicy sauce it came with.  Finally, the desserts were so, so pretty.  Even the apple cookies they gave us at the end (by surprise) were delightful.  I recommend La Sirena to those who are looking for a night out.  The food as a whole is impressive, and I think everyone works there as a team, which makes each execution successful.",5,0,1,Amanda K.,"Seattle, WA",707,348,2

My friend and I came here for a bday dinner last night and it was the best venue. From the moment you walk in you know the restaurant is going to be a special experience. Perched atop a staircase the entrance brings you right into the bar which was filled with a large variety of attractive and trendy people, some couples, business people but all had one thing in common- enjoying their time.For appetizers we split the octopus and burrata. The octopus was interesting as it was more fried than I'm used to having but the texture was surprisingly even more delicious. The burrata was delicious especially with the fig and eggplant on the side.I had the black spaghetti with lobster as I was recommended by the waiter and it was such a delicious flavor. Spicy with the richness of the lobster was the perfect balance. For main course I had the Branzino and almost licked the sauce off my plate. It was so yummy and the sauce on the bottom of the plate complemented the fish so well. My friend ordered the NY strip steak which was also delicious.For dessert we had the bombolini- which is fancy for yummy Italian donouhhts and the Orale bambina! The orale bambina was a yummy mocha marscapone with a chocolate mole sauce, so for you coffee lovers this is the dessert for you. As a treat we also got the negroni sundae which was my absolute favorite dessert dish. It reminded me of an orange push pop from my childhood except for the more refined version bursting with more flavor!

Hot crusty bread to start, yum. Mimosa and Bloody Mary cocktails were good but skimpy, BMary had too much ice. Shared the burrata starter, the star of this ho-hum meal that combined nicely crisped green tomatoes with sweet raisins and a large slab of fresh creamy cheese. The entree selection was very limited so we both settled on the ""High Tide"" consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon and potatoes. Everything was oversalted and swimming in butter and oil, sausages were mushy and gross, bacon was mainly inedible white fat, potatoes underdone. Two smooth tasty cappucinos to end, at least partly erased the bad taste. Check ran about $120 for two, way too much for what it was.

It's currently Thursday and I haven't heard back. I wanted to post my exact email here.Overall impressions:Food was excellent. We had two delicious pastas (cacio e pepe, spicy black spaghetti), prosciutto was very good, and the lamb was tasty. The bread was always hot. The service? Well here's my email.I just wanted to email you and let you know of my experience last night. First and foremost, the food was very very good. We had the prosciutto, had a bis pasta with the spicy black spaghetti and cacio e pepe, and split the lamb. It was all really enjoyable and the servers did a wonderful job serving the pasta, while the bussers were extremely attentive throughout the meal. I wish I could say the same about our server, Hugh.While I did not want to say anything last night as it was my birthday, I was extremely disappointed by Hugh's service. There were only five tables filled last night, so it was to much surprise that he seemed to forget we were even in the restaurant for much of the evening. At no point, during any course, did he come in and ask how we were doing, how the food was or if he could get us anything. I was going to order a glass of wine with our entree, but I never had the opportunity to do so, as once the server brought the dish, he did not come by until offering us dessert. The dessert (three scoops of gelato) took 20 minutes to come. My girlfriend asked for a candle in the gelato, as it was my birthday. He laughed and while there was a candle with the dessert, he never came by to even say Happy Birthday. Even after he gave us the check and we paid, he never took the one moment to say ""I hope you enjoyed everything and happy birthday"". My girlfriend thanked him for the night and he said ""yep"" and walked away.As I said, the food was wonderful and the restaurant was beautiful. I just was truly disappointed that our waiter couldn't make the evening as special as it should have been. I would even understand it if the restaurant was packed and he had a ton of tables to deal with. But that was not the case. It was a quiet, Sunday night and it just felt like Hugh could not be bothered with giving us the high quality service we expected. It almost felt like we were a nuisance for him.Thank you very muchSo there you have it.EDIT:After seeing my email, I was able to speak to the general manager of the La Sirena.

5.0,2/6/2018,"So I have to start off by saying this restaurant should not be judged by any negative reviews that may come from the hotel that is above the restaurant. If you are looking for amazing New York City food and a chef with a great imagination of flavors then look no further. This place my friends has everything you are looking for. A foodies dream establishment. I took a trip into the City with friends and experienced La Sirena for the first time since Chef Anthony Sasso has taken over the scene. Everything I am going to list was amazing so I am not gonna say the dish was amazing after every dish I list. Just get here and experience it for yourself. Your pallet will thank you and you will be back. The meal started with the mushroom lovers dream, Funghi Misti, scallop crudo, a meat and cheese dish, and a one bite molecular take on pasta carbonara. Ugh, I have to say it again, amazing. Next two courses were a double of the ""Bis"" which is a sharing of two different kinds of pasta. Well a double order got us a tasting of four different pasta dishes. Everything was so flavorful and cooked to perfection, al dente, the way pasta should be. For desert we got a few gelati's and a few other deserts. Everyone was something that one has never had before. The refreshing desert flavors made you wonder how did they do that.

Meanwhile, it's a $140 bottle and not the least expensive. The tone was condescending. We then ordered appetizers, which came in extremely small portions. Our entrees came, one of which was so hot that it burned the top of our guest's mouths and they could not continue eating. The pasta entrees were mediocre for $20+ price range.

Unfortunately the food was. It terribly good. Maybe because it was a limited menu or a large group. The chicken was tough and chewy.. all of us who received this entree gave up rather quickly. Those with the New York strip seemed happier and tended to actually eat their meal. While I love vegetables the broccoli rave and collard greens both had heavy spice - one surprisingly spicy and the other sharp and tangy.

4.0,1/11/2018,"i came here with a group for dinner. i was really dazzled with the space. so beautiful and intimate. it does a great job of removing you from the loud meatpacking area outside. the bar area is large and spacious. it also has a separate tapas style menu, you can only order at the bar.in the main dining room the menu is italian with some steaks etc. we tried quite a few things, all of the food was outstanding. highlights for me were- the tuna crudo (marinated in a delicious and zesty olive oil), the spicy black spaghetti, the agnolotti, and the roasted beets with goat cheese. really everything was very tasty. definitely order pasta, yum! service here was on point. there's basically a team of waitstaff taking care of you. they were all very friendly and attentive. unfortunately our main server was not on the same level of attentiveness. she never came back to check on us after the food was served, and also could've done a much better job on getting us drink refills (aka booze). typically had to flag someone down to get a bottle of wine or another cocktail.",9,0,0,Christina G.,"New York, NY",323,458,565

After posting the first review, somehow the manager got my contact information and personally made me feel uncomfortable about posting the review, which I later deleted. However from what I remember about my first review, here is what you can take away from this place:-The service was horrible. I'm pretty sure we saw our waiter about 2 times the whole night, when we arrived and when we paid. Other times it was us asking other waiters questions, or asking if they could find our waiter.-We had to ask for bread multiple times, again not our waiter, someone else in the area.-Our meatball appetizer came out cold in the middle. Wasn't even worth it to send back.-Entree was sub par, for a restaurant with a Michelin star I expected much more. I have been to multiple rated restaurants and they far outweigh this place.-Go somewhere else if you're looking for great service and great food.",0,5,0,Tessa B.,"Cranston, RI",0,9,5

4.0,12/26/2017,"My family and I came here on Christmas Eve and had a really nice meal. The service is really lacking here, which is super strange because there were probably about 20 servers there that night. We made a reservation and were seated right away. The space near the bar is really lovely: light and airy. The dinning room is pretty different in style. So much so that when we entered I almost felt like we were in a different restaurant. It was a little odd.Here was a pre-fixe for Christmas but also you could order from the a la carte menu which is what my family and I decided on. We started with wine and cocktails. The cocktail my husband got (the Pioneer) was excellent and well mixed but filled with TONS of ice so it was a total rip off. The wine by the glass list was pretty lacking and I wasn't super impressed with the choices. We settled on drinks and ordered from the regular menu.My parents each got appetizers: the buratta and the artichoke. They loved their appetizers and were very pleased. For an entree, I got the pesto lasagna, my husband got the cacio e Pepe agnolotti, my mother got a fish dish, and my father got pasta with duck ragu.My lasagne was absolutely incredible. So much flavor in the pesto and the lasagne was cooked beautifully. The béchamel sauce complimented the pesto perfectly and it was truly delicious. My husband's agnolotti was incredible as well. Amazing flavor in the sauce. The portion for my husbands was quite small, but was perfect for the lasagne because there were about 40 layers of pasta. My parents each loved their dishes as well. The service is severely lacking here and the portion sizes are really really small. The prices are outrageous for the amount of food and crappy service you're getting. My husband had to ask for bread twice before it came and requested olive oil and salt and pepper for the bread and it just never came out. There were TONS of servers there so I'm not sure what was going on. The food is good but I don't know if it's good enough to recommend coming here to spend a fortune.",7,0,0,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,1361,1267

My only qualm is that the restaurant is pretty out of the way, but if it's a special night or you want to go an extra mile for good food, just go. It'll be worth your time and money ($68pp).Bay scallops were good. The black spaghetti was good too. The real winner for me was the Branzino, which came over a sea of butter sauce. I don't really like butter, and the sauce by itself triggered my gag reflex, but it complemented the fish well, which was cooked to perfection. Portions were also massive.Not a lot to say that others haven't, but more than anything, if you're having doubts, just pull the trigger and go ASAP.

2.0,12/2/2017,This establishment seems to have forgot that without customers they would be out of business. We were a large party and the policy is not to seat you until everyone is there even though the table was set and empty. Several of the appetizers and first courses were brought out at the same time. Compounding the poor service was the fact that the pasta dishes were either cold or barely warm. It was also hard to get the waiters attention. This place certainly does not compare to the other Michelin restaurants I have dined in.,0,0,0,Martin S.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,2,0
4.0,11/29/2017,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. At $68 for 4 courses it's a steal and the ambiance is great for a date night or dinner with a small group of friends. I see a lot of people mentioning poor service but we received great service. Water was never empty, our wine glasses were always full, and the pacing of the courses was spot on. The wine list is huge, I highly recommend checking it out before you come. I ended up settling on a $60 Super Tuscan which was delicious. It looked like wines started at round $40. We started with the sunchoke sformato and the carne crudo. The sformato was alright, not really my type of dish. Flavor was great but I'm not a huge fan of savory dishes like this. The carne crudo was delicious, the beef was good and the truffle covered crostini was delicious. For our primi we had the black spaghetti and the ravioli al'amatriciana. Both were delicious with the black spaghetti having decent sized chunks of lobster. The ravioli was amazing, perhaps the best I've ever had. The butter sauce was light but the filling spicy and salty with a meaty tomato flavor. Just really an amazing dish. Pasta was served table side so we both got a little of each. For our mains we got the short rib and the short rib and branzino. I wasn't a huge fan of the short rib, while tender it lacked flavor was was a bit too sweet. The branzino was phenomenal and one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. It was a huge piece on a bed of kale with a butte sauce. It had a bit of heat but not too much and the flavors blended perfectly. I honestly dream about this fish now. For dessert we had the semifreddo and the dolce di pane. The semifreddo was delicious. It was a big mix of texture and temperature and flavor. It wasn't too heavy and a great refreshing finish to a nice meal.  My girlfriend chose the dolce di pane which I only had a bite of. The bread pudding is very very rich and chocolatey so be warned. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this meal. I will definitely return and I highly recommend it.

5.0,9/19/2017,"La Sirena has been on my list for a while, but I happened to stop in on a whim for brunch one Saturday. Luckily, they had seating available on their beautiful outdoor patio. One thing I love about the outdoor seating in particular is the fact that the eating area is one floor above street level, so it is less noisy and separated from people walking on the sidewalk. I did see the inside of the restaurant as well, along with the lobby of its adjoined hotel, and the atmosphere was beautiful. I loved the modern minimalism of the dining room and bar, juxtaposed with the dark and cozy look of the hotel lobby. The ambience is quite fantastic. The brunch menu is a little small, but they have a nice range of dishes to choose from for those who like it sweet, as well as for those who like it savory. If you have a sweet tooth, like me, go for their noteworthy ""muffin"", which is hardly a muffin but rather an enormous coffee cake-sort of confection that's the size of my head. It is obviously meant to be shared amongst many people, and features a dulce de leche sauce that is poured by yourself into the warm core of the ""muffin"", which the waiter excavates with his serving spoons. I always love dishes that involve an element of participation on behalf of the diner, and it was certainly cool to pour the warm rich sauce into that crater of sweet cake goodness. It was probably one of the most decadent things I have ever eaten, definitely sweet but the muffin itself was so moist and delicious. I think I put too much of the sauce inside, but with the right amount it is delicious! I would recommend using it as a dipping sauce perhaps, because the muffin is honestly perfect on its own. I've never had anything like it, and it was definitely one of the more memorable brunch meals I've had. For mains, I went for the pancakes with marscapone and amaretti. They were some of the best pancakes I've ever had, so moist yet not overly dense, and the creaminess of the marscapone went well with the crumbles of amaretti on top. I probably should have gone for a savory dish, because I did get a stomach ache later on from all the sweetness, but it was totally worth it. I also got to taste their horchata french toast and breakfast paella, both of which were also excellent. The paella in particular is something I would definitely order next time. As for the service, unlike others who have dined here, it was top notch. Our server was very friendly and warm, as well as very knowledgable on the menu. We didn't wait very long for anything, and I felt the service was professional and up to par with the atmosphere and the food. Overall, this is easily one of my new favorite restaurants in the city. I did get a peek at the dinner menu on the way out, which looks very good and certainly worth trying. It wasn't until after dining at La Sirena that I realized it holds a Michelin star, which doesn't surprise me much given the quality of the food, service, and beautiful atmosphere.

Upon arrival around 6pm the restaurant was empty and never filled up -- I guess there is a lot of competition for Italian fine dining in Manhattan. Everyone was nice, but there wasn't anything about the restaurant that wowed me. The linguine with red clam sauce tasted like literal tomato sauce on pasta.

The service was incredible. The food and wine was delicious to boot. We ordered and ranked the below tapas:Paella croquetas (B) not my favorite but okay. Slightly odd aftertaste but did have some elements of a paella. Could have been prepared more flavorful.Patatas bravas (A-) classic Spanish tapa and was definitely not a disappointment. A great compliment to our tapas and was very filling with a large portion. A- simply because it didn't taste exactly the way I remember in Spain but come on, it's NYC! Lol. Still a great complement. Blackened pulpo (B+) very flavorful and had great texture. The fillers in the dish (olives and strawberries) were different and didn't mesh well with me tbh. Purely subjective. The octopus was great and filling though!Iberian cured meats charcutterie(A+) a definite classic and the star of the show. The chorizo and jamon iberico were delicious and took me back to touring Madrid. Very authentic taste and did not skimp out on portion size.

They brought them wrong Bottle to the table twice, they up sold us on a more expensive wine and then brought two different bottles that they opened to the table.The actual food was good, nothing amazing but solid, the pasta was particularly good. Then it was time for the dessert to come. It most have been at least 30 minutes between when they places the dessert menus on the table and when they came to to check on us. At least the last 20 minutes of that the menus were closed and we were doing everything we could to get he attention of the staff.Then we get the bill and it's wrong, they over charged us by $35 because they billed everything ala carte instead of the prefix we orders, we even had a few minutes conversation with the waiter about how it worked. When we pointed this out to him, he looked confused and then told us we had not participated, we assured him we did and he said the entire table had to participate and we had not.We then asked to speak to a manager and he finally came to the table 10-15 minutes later and we explained the situation to him. He said he would look into it and get back to us. He came back to the table a little while later and explained to us that we had in fact not ordered the pre fix because we ordered 3 pastas instead of 2, not sure how it looked at the bill for 10 minutes and came to this concussion. He was totally wrong about this and when we went over the receipt item by item with him it was pretty clear we had in fact ordered 2. He then took off the $35 that was over charged and nothing beyond that.I have never seen management in what wants to consider themselves a top restaurant handle a situation so poorly.Very disappointed, the manager did give us his card and told us to let him know when we came back.

I came in with a standard expectation for most Michelin starred restaurants but this one definitely was on the lower end of the ones I have been to. For an appetizer, I got the melanzana, which was mushy and pretty bland for something that had a chili broth. I would probably not order it again if I came back. For my main course, I got the tagliatelle and then split the garganelli with a friend. Both were decent dishes, but definitely not anything that kept me raving about once my meal was finished. To drink, I got a beer from what I would consider their biggest strength, which was an extensive beer list with beers from all over NY state and elsewhere. I was happy to find an upscale place actually have a beer list since I am not much of a wine guy. I also got a cocktail which was great, don't remember the name off the top of my head. The service was pretty good, but we were looked over a lot, probably because we were a group of young kids at a nicer restaurant, but things like water and simple requests for an additional plate took longer than necessary.

So didn't receive our drinks for 40 minutes.  We were then given other tables appetisers TWICE. and no one seemed to think it was a problem. We were then given the wrong dinner. Something was going wrong. We did complain to the manager, and they still continued to make mistakes - we then started receiving double orders of our dinner. I Had the orata picatta and my husband had the four course tasting which we both thought were amazing. But after all the constant issues throughout the night, the manager did not take one item off the bill, but we received every kind of desert (so they couldn't mess that up because it's everything they had to offer).

I am not normally a fan of octopus - having had too many rubbery ones.  This was amazing.  Tender texture that you could cut with a fork and flavor that reminded me of lobster.  If it wasn't for the suction cups on the tentacle, I would have sworn it was not octopus. The Crostini Alla Toscana (chicken liver) was the low point of the meal. The Black Spaghetti (squid ink) sounded like it would have a lot of flavors, but was fairly bland.  Cavatelli was just okay.  For dessert, we had the Bomboloni, which was a pleasant end to the meal.  Overall a good experience, but I will probably not go back.",0,0,0,Perry W.,"Dallas, TX",68,5,0
5.0,7/5/2017,"Came here for brunch with my sister and I would highly recommend. Great outdoor seating area with natural lighting. Lots of shaded seating options for those who want to stay out of the sun. Only negative here is you're in the middle of 9th avenue on a perfect day which means: lots of traffic. But for most of us, it quickly becomes white noise. Crispy pork belly ($21) with poached egg, avocado, yellow tomato, saffron, and chimichurri exceeded expectations. Perfect pieces of pork belly perfectly prepared. Many times you will find the outer skin overdone but La Sirena kept the texture even. I wish there were more than 3 pieces of pork belly! The Amaretti Mascarpone Pancakes with maple syrup and butter were very soft and fluffy, definitely better than all the options at Clinton Street. Goat neck chilaquiles ($19) with nixtamal's tortillas, fried egg, and ricotta salata was really excellent. Unlike at Cookshop and other brunch spots, the tortillas was not swimming around in a bowl of sauce. At La Sirena it was prepared almost like a mille-crepe with dozens of layers of tortilla, laced with ricotta. Egg on top was perfect #yolkporn.

That's because the chef is from Casa Mono - so if you miss those dishes, you can now get it here with a different (very) vibe.  The tapas were great, and the paella was good although a bit too rich and greasy with all the sauces topped over and I appreciate a bit more rice in my paella - it lacks balance without, and becomes more of an dish of seafood display than the warm, welcoming Spanish dish that I know and love.The service is fantastic, and given the chef seem to have just recently situated himself here, I'll be back in hopes that it gets better!",4,1,2,Annie H.,"New York, NY",216,606,1799

I'd never miss a cocktail that has a hint of habanero...!) The space as a whole came out beautifully and the dining room we were in was low lit giving it a mellow, sexy vibe. It was SO low lit though, that I needed my phone to read the menu. As a group of four, we started with a dozen oysters with the usual accoutrements, the garlic grilled shrimp, and the crudo; we paired that with a white wine from the Campania region. The apps were all good, but nothing really jumped out at me and the crudo would have been better had it been sliced thinner. I then had the squid ink pasta with lobster, ramps, and jalapeño. (It was my cheat night, and I was at a B&B restaurant after all...) This too was good, but didn't blow me away the dishes at Babbo and Del Posto have (with emphasis on the former...) My husband opted for the lasagna with fresh peas. He typically goes for a meat, but can rarely pass up the promise of a solid lasagna. He felt that it was fine enough. Moving on... I'm not a dessert eater, but my husband ordered the chocolate copetta (I had half a fork full for the sake of knowledge), and our dining companions the semifreddo.

2.0,4/2/2017,"if you like paying way too much for mediocre food, then this is the place for you. Food is way too expensive for the portion size. The $25 pasta was 7 bites. we had 5 main courses. 3 steaks came out completely over cooked. one came back again, over cooked. they sent out a third one that had the first 1/2 inch grey, and then the rest was so raw that it was still cold (was supposed to be medium rare). The only reason I didnt give it a 1 star was because they were very apologetic and took all three steaks off of the bill. Even after the steaks were taken off it was still $75 a person (without booze).",0,0,0,Jon S.,"Manhattan, NY",447,36,0

3.0,3/20/2017,"I am a huge fan of Mario Batali's cooking style in general, and an even bigger fan of his Spanish tapas haunt Casa Mono. After finally being able to score a res at La Sirena (the Italy v Spain concept is fascinating) to host my cousins that are in town from Paris, I scoured the menu for something to try upon arrival and settled on the ""Asparagus"" tasting menu as did two of the others in my party. The dishes in the tasting menus are an innovative combination of authentic Spanish and Italian ingredients, but they go a bit too far - especially the fritto mixto which, as the main dish of the tasting menu, lacks true depth and is instead reminiscent of the over-battered and over-fried 'delights' one might find at the Seaside Heights boardwalk. I actually had to pick off the fried dough to get to the real ingredients and flavors of the dish, which are Meyer lemon (seriously? Fried lemon? With the rind?), microscopic calamari, and asparagus. Normally I would vow to never return to a place that is seemingly hyped-up and lacking in true culinary value, but I think the mistake was mine and will return to order something more 'traditional' next time. I cannot say enough about the appetizers - the prosciutto v. jamón serrano is a must-try, as is the burrata - and the cocktails. When my mom shared with our waiter that she was disappointed with her dessert, he immediately suggested one that she might like, on the house. The somm is as knowledgeable as the wine list is impeccable, and our waiter (I wish I could remember his name!) was an absolute pleasure, attentive, and truly knows the food. It is really the staff that is bringing me back for a second chance - not sure I will go back if they fail that one, too.Another thing that I found strange - I made my reservation on March 7 for March 18. OpenTable said there was one table available for 6:15, and the next open table was at 9:30. I called La Sirena, and they confirmed. We sat down at about 6:20, and there were no other diners in the main dining room except for my party of 4 and two other tables. When our entrées arrived at about 8, half of the dining room was still empty. I am not sure what happened, but I would have made a later reservation had I known.",0,0,0,Mo V.,"New York, NY",5,6,0

I loved the egg yolk on top.Burrata, which was also very good, who doesn't like cheese?  I would have preferred an accompaniment other than the sweet potato caponata, but it was unique.Fluke Curdo, which was also very tasty though not my favorite appetizer.All of the appetizers were gluten free, we just noted to the server to put the bread on the side.For entrees, we ordered:Fideua, which was awesome. The consistency of the noodles had a fried texture that you would see in Asian cuisine. Short rib, which was perfectly cooked and came with nice sides.The pasta was obviously not gluten free, but the short rib was, so that was a bonus and we ordered 2 of those for the table.We were too full for dessert unfortunately, maybe next time we'll save room.",9,2,3,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

I must say that it was the first and worst day of the winter blizzard so that may have factored in to the lousy, well not lousy, but poorly prepared food we received. On the waiters recommendation we started with the lamb ragú pasta which was amazing. Then we ordered the pork loin/chop for two. When it arrived it was cold to the bone. I was flabbergasted. A Mario Batali restaurant that serves cold food? WTF?Our waiter who was lovely immediately brought it back and they reheated it (we expected a brand new dish but whatever, I mean they microwave their bread so...). We ate it and it was fine, but not at all the experience we had expected. The wine guy was on top of his game and he was topping off our wines throughout our meal. At the end we received complimentary sorbet and a glass of effervescent desert wine which was delicious (would have preferred a discount on the food but whatever). All in all it was an ok experience but my God. If you are a Mario Batali establishment, please make sure that when you have a braised pork shank for two, that it's thoroughly cooked. This wasn't how we thought our anniversary dinner would go but in the end, the great staff and wine guy made it a little bit better.

4.0,3/11/2017,"Came during NYFW (New York Fashion Week), for a free happy hour event hosted by the Maritime Hotel in downtown. My girlfriends and I, being our first fall in New York, were scrounging around and looking for events to go to and found this per a suggestion from one of my friends' family members. We decided check it out after school, since it was a nice day and free alcohol, come on! Let me start off by saying that this hotel is absolutely gorgeous, with such a old-time feel (think plush leather chairs, bookshelves with books, dimly lit and soft-spoken front desk staff) but managed to still make the accommodations and restaurant/patio area feel very sleek and modern. We headed to the front desk asking about the free event, to which they directed us across the hallway to the patio where the event was being held. It was mainly hotel guests, enjoying a drink and the sunshine on a nice New York afternoon but we didn't feel out of place at all. They had a cab, a white, and a grapefruit-vodka drink at hand, with two bar stations for us to get drinks at. Of course, we tipped after every drink we got - it was just a beautiful setting for us to enjoy each others' company, and they even came around with food samplers! No pictures, but they included vegetable soup shots served in nice glass shot glasses, mini quiches, bite-sized cucumber tomato towers, fried vegetable patties, bruschetta with olive-oil dressed fresh tomatoes. There was even a DJ playing his set through the whole 2 hours we were there, who was pretty good and handsome to boot.

I would imagine it would be even better during the summer months while the patio is open. I started with the burrata which was extremely tasty. I would suggest sharing this with at LEAST one other, as it was quite rich/heavy. Afterwards we shared orders of the lasagna, pasta with the spicy tomato sauce and a pasta with mushroom dish that the kitchen made special for us, being that we are vegetarian. They wanted to make sure that we left with the true experience. Each dish was excellent. Finally, we had the beef main which was also extremely tasty. Lastly, as for the sides, I recommend the potatoes and brussel sprouts - both very good! The cauliflower was ok.

The cod cheek tasted very rich as it is fatty and the little clams they have is very fresh and soft; the sauce is quite nice, a bit sour and goes well with the fatty cheek and the shiso verde.

Our server knocked my wine over but immediately brought a new glass over. We next ordered an appetizer of boquerones with fennel. I'd have to day that was the highlight of our dinner. For entrees my husband got a dish with lobster, quail and mushrooms and I got the braised short ribs. My husbands dish was a little off.. the flavor just wasn't there and my short ribs tasted very gamy. The salsa verde on the dish made it palatable but neither of us finished our plates.

So as we did, you should try the sardines, head cheese, and jamon. Also, we ordered the patatas bravas with Uni mayo, mein gott, amazing. Also, I know it sounds weird but we ordered the chicharrones in hot chocolate mole, sinfully delicious. The service, however, is not perfect nor is it horrendous.

Slow service for the drinks (too many complicated mixed drinks with fun names) - Jack and Diet took a while to make it to the table. The service was mixed - one person asked multiple times for a Diet Coke and that took far longer than getting a mixed drink. And getting my jacket knocked off my chair a couple times leaves less than desired steps on my sleeves.The service aside, food was pre fixe for the group, with a starter (we asked for table starters, and they directed us to individual choices instead... hm) - I had the Alici Marinate with Fennel Three Ways, which tasted all the same way. The pasta was the best part of the meal - the squid ink pasta (tonarelli neri) w/ lobster & jalapeno was good, but the Ravioli all'Amatriciana with Spring Onion Butter was even better. Everyone was served the same two pastas (split on the plate). The main was a Crispy Orata Piccata, with a butter sauce and fileted from the top - professional, but wasn't too enticing.Dessert was some gelati, but nothing exciting - too many ice grains, in fact.

Both were great. If we had stopped there this would have been a four or five star experience.But we kept going. The chicken entree was so spicy (and no indication on the menu) we had to send it back. Paul handled it great. No questions just what can he do? He suggested he tell the cook to prepare with no pepper which they did. It was fine the second time. The cavatelli was a hit. The meat that came with it not so much - fatty. I had the beef Braciole. Not very tasty. Left a good portion of it and that rarely happens.Sides we had the rapini aka broccoli rabe, again very spicy and cauliflower carbonara.The wine list seemed a bit pricey but we had a nice bottle of Montepulciano for $80. The place is big and it got crowded. But the noise level is fine. The bill came to about $75 a head. Definitely can eat better at that price point.

1.0,10/31/2016,"Having been a frequent diner at Del Posto I decided to stop in at La Sirenas yesterday to have a drink and try something on the menu.My husband and I got there just around 4:00pm on Sunday and sat at the bar. My first complaint is the bar staff. NO ONE SMILED!!!!! NO ONE!!!! Not even the management whom I assumed were management because they were in suits.Afer getting our drinks I asked to see the menu. Upon given the menu the bartender told us we couldn't get any food until 5:00pm, the kitchen is closed.I detest when I get told what I can't have instead of what I can have. Clearly there wasn't even a nut or and olive to be offered up!We were going to leave but the sky opened up and it started to pour so we had no choice but to stay and wait it out. We decided we'd get something to eat so we asked again for the menu. We're now told that NO food is served at the bar, SOOOO I asked for a table. It's now 4:45 and I noticed that a table that had just been seated were being offered an antipasto cart of cheese and meats and olives. I asked the waitstaff if we could get a plate from this cart and I was told that I couldn't. The reason this table was being offered the cart was because they paid for a PRIFIX before arriving.I really didn't understand that reply but I shrugged it off. It was very clear we had to wait until 5:00pm to order food!Now while sitting at our table and waiting for the 5 o'clock hour to strike I notice the waiter with the cart going to each person at the BAR and offering them food from the antipasto cart!!!OK so let's review.........NO FOOD until 5:00pmNO Eating at the barWe can't have the antipasto because apparently we hadn't prepaid for it!!!!!!!!OMG!!!! Could it get any worse!WE got up and let the hostess know how frustrated we were with our experience and walked out!Shame on you Mario!!!Tell your staff they could start by smiling!!!!!!",0,1,0,joyce d.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,4,0

The service was great, as were our cocktails, but sadly the food was a disappointment. My first complaint was the very boring bread. It was the kind of every day Italian bread you buy at a grocery store. Where was the crusty, chewy, rustic bread I've had at other Batali restaurants? My husband and I each got salads for appetizers and they were both overdressed, and his was supposed to have shaved Parmesan on it but there were only maybe two shavings. My pasta dish was the cavatelli with spare ribs. The server described it as a pork ragu but it was just pasta and tomato sauce with two tiny knobs that I guess were the spare ribs that each had a little meat and gristle on them. On a positive note my husbands Brasciole was delicious. Lastly, the Chocolate Copetta was very uninspiring. The espresso sponge cake was kind of mushy.  I should have known when there were still plenty of reservations available only two days in advance that I should lower my expectations.

2.0,10/19/2016,"Upon entering the restaurant the service was weak. I told the host that I was joining friends who I saw already seated. She waved her hand in their direction and said ""they're over there, enjoy!""  Bad start. Service was chaotic. It took sometime to figure out who our server was. People swarmed the table but never really knew what to do or what plates to set where. I hate plate roulette.  One appetizer was missing. One entree was missing. For both courses they offered to quickly prep the missing plate - but then one is eating after everyone else?  No thanks. The food, we all agreed, was good, well prepared and presented. The service was just awful. As for the wine list - horrible. Unless you have extensive knowledge of Italian wines, one will be lost swiping through the iPod format list. The prices are way off compared to the price of entrees with most bottles well over $100 and $200 seeming to be the average. We had to ask the sommelier for a recommendation for a good red at $75. He could come up with one - at $80. If one is to use an iPod there is the option to provide a detailed description of each wine; sorting by price; by taste or body. This one is sorted by region and variety with NO explanation or description of any label. Impossible.  And pages upon pages of this. Give us 20 good bottles priced reasonably and we'll be sure to drink more. Fix your service issues & wine list and maybe we'll be back.

There were a few minor misses - my end of the table waited awhile for our wine, they forgot to wrap up my food, and the meat in one of the pasta dishes was a little gristly - but overall we had a great time and it was due in large part to the exceptional service. I really enjoyed the heirloom tomato/stracciatella appetizer, and the truffled chicken was delicious. We split the squid ink pasta and one with pork ribs. The squid ink was perfect - strong umami flavors without being too salty. I wish I'd gone with Nonna's olive oil cake for dessert instead of the panna cotta but only because I'd just had amazing Panna Cotta at Wildair and anything else paled in comparison.

5.0,9/8/2016,"Rating this place less than five stars should be illegal!!! We had a dinner for four here Sunday night. It was phenomenal. My son had the bucatini. He ordered another one and ate two plates! I tried it and I understand why. It was AMAZING!. I had the branzino. Truly amazing. We had cauliflower with pancetta. It was amazing. My wife had the lobster which was only $20. I don't understand how they can sell a $20 full lobster, but somehow they do. That was my least favorite. But I still tried it and liked it. Sommelier was super knowledgable about wine. She recommended a light, minerally italian bottle (and I can't tell you how much I appreciate that she is recommending a $60 bottle not a $600 bottle off the gate). We didn't like it. She sensed it, came back, asked a few more questions, understood our taste and immediately brought another, similarly priced but more full bodied bottle. It was excellent. They never charged for the first one. We had two deserts. The pineapple with gelato and my daugher had a chocolaty desert. I don't like chocolate but I tried a small piece before it was fully gone. It was amazing also. The setting is also amazing. We requested seating outside and sat at the patio. Beautiful people, very chic, vibrant street action right in front of us. The previous night we ate at Babbo. I personally prefer La Sirena ten times. And it was 30% cheaper. We will be back when we visit NYC next time!!!!",5,1,2,bora o.,"San Francisco, CA",38,112,0

However the pasta which I forgot to take a pic of looks like just a half order and for $19 is quite ridiculous! It's a marinara pasta! I was thinking of having an event there but it left a bad taste on my mouth. Who charges $19 for a tiny portion of pasta? It's quite unbelievable.

We sat inside, but there is a huge outdoor patio that was hopping. The space is huge and gorgeous. I sat at the bar while I was waiting for my friends. All of the bartenders were amazing. I had a delicious specialty cocktail called the Pretty Woman. There was a waiter who had a cart filled with all sorts of yummy items like olives, cheeses and prosciutto. He went around the bar to see if anyone wanted anything which was pretty cool.  My friends arrived and we were seated at a great table. I couldn't get over how large the place was. The service was great. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and the food was delicious. Let's see if I can remember what we all ate. I really should have written this on Thursday night after I got home.Okay: We had the crudo special which was a yellowtail I believe and it was very fresh.We had a salad that was also very fresh but I can't remember what was in it. We had a pasta sampler that was insane. Black Squid Ink Spaghetti with Jalapeno and Lobster. OMG I'm still thinking about that one. The other pasta was with sausage in a red sauce that was awesome too. The steak for 2 was perfect for the 3 of us. We asked for it medium rare and while it was delicious it was more medium than medium rare.We ordered the swordfish too, but I was so full I didn't even have a bite.The food came with these lardo puffs that I just didn't like. I guess if you're into lardo you'd like them.I didn't want dessert but my friend ordered the donuts which of course were great.

We went for dinner on a Sunday night and were able to be seated right away since this place is HUGE!We were pretty hungry, so we decided to split a couple of dishes:Bread (3 stars): The bread and butter here was pretty average--a good start, but nothing to write home about.Sweet corn and charred beans (4.5 stars): This dish was a lot better than I was expecting and was super sweet and fresh. The only complaint I have with this dish was the size, but otherwise it was very tasty.Bis of pasta (4.5 stars): What an excellent option--two choices of pasta for one price and a very good portion size as well!---Tonnarelli (5 stars): The squid ink pasta with the sauce and lobster is absolutely fantastic. I had only had squid ink pasta once before and was pretty unimpressed, but this rendition was phenomenal. ---Cavatelli (4 stars): This dish was also very good--not quite the depth of flavor as the tonnarelli, but very good nonetheless.Swordfish (4 stars): The swordfish was cooked decently, but I felt that the meat itself was a bit underwhelming as far as flavor goes. That being said, the added ingredients really did a good job of upping the flavor of this dish.Overall, this place served up some great dishes, especially in the first couple of courses.

Yes, this was Brunch but I felt a little anxiety nonetheless.When we arrived and during our meal we were never given the "" once over "" OR the "" up and down."" This was a very good sign. Now, tossing away my insecurities..........The design inside this Maritime Hotel restaurant is ULTRA modern and SLEEK. You could eat off the beautiful marble floors or the pristine countertops at the bar. We were seated in the corner next to the window. Rico came over to get us started on waters and concoctions. Once again, I dove into my favorite breakfast drink...the Hibiscus. While reviewing the menu we devoured the fresh bread baskets that were provided. For appetizers we had three items I can remember. The Fingerling Potatoes, the Heirloom Tomatoes AND the Octopus. I do not do tentacles but the Heirlooms were good and the Fingerlings were AWESOME. Honestly, I did not want to overdo it on my entree' as we would be hoofing around town and my large 13 feet were already yelping. (Pun intended) I just wanted to keep it simple so I selected the Meatball Hero. My better half and my son went all in on the Panino Toscano. I realize that these choices are not complex but they felt right at the time.Everyone was pleased and I especially want to mention how incredible Rico and his crew treated us.

1.0,8/1/2016,"What a disappointment! Being a fan of Mario Batali I was expecting the usual excellent service and food on a rare night out. I most recently had a wonderful experience at Tarry Lodge in Port Chester. The restaurant itself is quite large but elegant, if a little cold. Speaking of cold, our server couldn't have seemed more annoyed to have to speak to us. He had absolutely no warmth and his recommendations seemed rehearsed and stiff. We first ordered some very overpriced glasses of wine, the recommendation from the sommelier was on point but the white was served ice cold. I had to let it warm up for about 10 minutes before it was even drinkable. Unfortunately, our appetizers were served about five minutes after we placed the order, before even having sip of wine. The Sweet Corn and Charred Romano Beans was so pedestrian and was quite honestly an odd combination of ingredients. The dish we received looked nothing like the elegant presentation I saw photos of. Aside from not personally loving the menu item itself, the taste did nothing to change my mind. Overly buttered corn with a few beans and charred cheese. It was odd and obviously thrown on the plate with no thought. We also had the Artichokes and Sunchokes which was a huge failure. The artichokes tasted straight from can, dried, sliced and put on a plate with no seasoning, flavor or reason to be there. It was awful. The entrees were unfortunately not any better and also served only a few minutes after our table was cleared. We shared the Squid Ink Pasta, Lobster, Sweet Corn & Jalapeno and Bucatini La Sirena: Spicy Octopus with Estratto. Both of the pastas themselves were very good and obviously handmade. The sauces were also good, but nothing more than that. Unfortunately, both the octopus and lobster was served in such small portions that our dishes were basically plain pasta. They seafood was also overcooked and unseasoned. The lobster was chewy and obviously very overdone and the octopus tasted like it was thrown in a pot with the sauce to boil. We left over almost all of the octopus pieces. It was such a disspointment after having such memorable experiences in his other restaurants. The kicker was that they knew it was my birthday but because we didn't order dessert (due to the awful meal) they served a small plate that said Happy Birthday with the check and some melted wrapped chocolate. Sixty minutes later, rushed out the door with a terrible meal behind us. Never again - this place will not last.",0,1,0,Pamela E.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,0

5.0,7/11/2016,"La Sirena has been on my radar for a while now and I am so glad I finally came in for dinner last weekend. To start, the space is absolutely beautiful and the service is impeccable. Everything we had was tasty from the cocktails to the dessert. They have a great cocktail list--I had the Jet Setter cocktail with dinner, which was excellent and my boyfriend loved the Perfect Storm cocktail.To start, we had the heirloom tomatoes with stracciatella, the sweet corn, and the carne cruda-- all which were great. I thought the heirloom tomato dish was probably the best of the three just because the tomatoes were so fresh and beautiful-- and I am obsessed with all things mozzarella/burrata.For the entrees, we got the Lasagne al Pesto e Patate and the Tonnarelli Neri (squid ink pasta). Both pasta dishes were absolutely delicious. I normally would not order lasagna, but this lasagna has thin slices of potato within the layers and delicious pesto on top. The squid ink pasta also isn't a pasta I would jump on right away, but it was such a great dish and we're so happy we ended up getting it-- lobster, jalapeno- yes, yes, yes.Overall, I had a really great experience and would 100% return.",8,0,0,Kyle S.,"Manhattan, NY",17,86,565
2.0,7/10/2016,"This was my second time dining at La Sirena and likely the last.  The service was comically bad for a Batali restaurant.  2 of us went for a snack and some drinks on the outdoor patio yesterday afternoon.  There is an item on the menu called ""Beef crudo""; I asked the waiter if this was a beef carpaccio and he confirmed that it was so I ordered it along with the tomato and stracciatella.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  First the food arrives and the beef crudo was actually a beef tartare, not carpaccio.  I severely dislike tartare which was part of why I confirmed what the dish was prior to ordering.  I told the waiter that this was not carpaccio and I couldn't eat it.  He started arguing with me that I hadn't said carpaccio, I had said tartare.  My dining companion chimed in that he was wrong, everybody had said carpaccio, but continued with his attitude.  He did take the dish away and it did not end up on the bill.  Next, I noticed a gnat had flown into my glass and asked for a spoon to get it out with.  I would have continued drinking the nearly-full glass but the server asked ""would you like a new glass?"" so I said okay.  My friend and I just stared in disbelief as a new glass was brought over and filled with the remainder of our bottle of wine and they had the nerve to ask if we wanted to order another.  I think the waiter must have seen our jaws hanging down to the floor because he hesitantly asked us if everything was okay and we explained that it was not so he said he would speak to his manager and try to get us a replacement glass for the ""bugged"" wine.  He did finally do this but the damage had already been done.",0,0,0,Meredith S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

3.0,7/8/2016,"I really wanted to love this place and maybe we visited on an off night, but I wasn't enthralled.This is a 2.5 star spot, but I will round up because it's Friday afternoon as I write this, so I'm in weekend mode.  If it was Monday morning morning, it would have been 2 stars.  First, we got seated almost 40 minutes past our reservation time and when we finally got seated, there were some empty tables around us.  Hmmm, seemed odd but the host explained they were short staffed.  Well, that explanation would have went a long way had they told us that prior to seating us so late.  By then, we were totally annoyed and starving but the annoyed part could have been avoided had they communicated this to us.  I've barked about this before in reviews....why is it so difficult for resto staff to treat their diners like humans, rather than just dollar signs?  Communication and customer service go a looong way, but it's still difficult to find.The food was good, some quite good, but given it's a Batali resto, I was expecting better.  The burrata, which is one of my favorite all time foods, seemed to be missing something and it wasn't very creamy...disappointed.  The artichoke salad was quite tasty.  Bucatani la sirena had serious kick but the octopus was cut into such small pieces, I felt there was hardly any in there. The lamb chops were a bit on the 'lamby' side but the short ribs were amazing.    Ordered a couple of desserts - the crema al cioccolato was delish.The service was pretty slow, but given they were short staffed, I guess that made sense.  They did give us a round of muscato and a dessert on the house due to the delay, which was a very nice gesture.  But it would have been a nicer gesture if they comped a round of drinks or a dessert we actually ordered, rather than give us something we didn't really want/need.Not impressed with this resto and not rushing back.",2,0,0,Stacey F.,"Tampa, FL",13,129,5

2.0,7/1/2016,"I'm surprised that Pete Wells gave La Sirena two stars because the food wasn't good at all. They had introduced the beef tartar on the menu yesterday and it was good, but it had a bit too much spicy mayo. I then had the squid ink pasta and it was presented beautifully, but it didn't taste good. The noodles were black, but there wasn't a sauce with it. It was very dry and the lobster was around the plate, not mixed together so the pasta didn't really get lobster flavor. Finally, it had bread crumbs, which I didn't think would be an issue at first, but then noticed that it sort of hides the fact that the pasta doesn't taste like squid ink at all. For squid ink pasta I would highly recommend going to Upholstery Store, Giovanni Rana (which is right across the street from La Sirena), or even Cacio e Vino in EV. These all have a better squid ink pasta dish than La Sirena.  Very, very disappointing.My boyfriend had the branzino and I thought it tasted better than my regrettable squid ink pasta, but he said it tasted as if they coated the fish with pepper. So this dish was also not a success.The wine was good. The bottles are priced well.The service was really great. We got in a bit early and they told us to wait at the bar. Then the waitress came right at the time of our reservation and walked us to our table. Even though it was packed, the waiters seemed organized and we felt that they took good care of us. At the end of our dinner we both thought that the restaurant was a place where you could come in the afternoon and enjoy a bottle of wine with an appetizer, but that it isn't a place to have an exceptional dinner. Then we saw that there's construction in front of Chelsea Market and right next to it too, so there's not really much of a view either.Sorry, Batali, but this is strike #2.

The staff greeted me warmly and accommodated me at the table immediately. Bringing chair, water, place setting, and an extra glass for the bottle of wine at the table fairly quickly. Also, they let us know they would accommodate us at a 4 top that was leaving soon. We eventually declined as we were comfortable with the arrangements originally made available to us. My friends had richer dishes like the soft shell crab app and the meatballs. Which they mentioned were texturally on point but lacking in seasoning. I had the red snapper crudo...which was great except it was drowned in olive oil? The primary taste was of oil, not snapper. Presentation, cut, and quality were there but there was a clear mishandling of ingredients. I say give it a try but don't expect to be blown away.....yet.

Came with high expectations but was disappointed in the overall experience.  The appetizers were good but not outstanding - soft shell crab the exception - it was excellent. The outside dining area is very nice but the service was the real letdown. First, someone should always greet you when arrive - did not happen as you need to find the reception area in the middle of the restaurant off the bar area (bar is very upscale). We were all seated and ordered wine and our meals. This is where it all began to fall apart as the waiters came and gone but never really noticed us - exception the sommelier who was great. They bumped into our seats and food dropped throughout the meal - very annoying. Main courses were just OK, portions  on the smaller side but not outstanding. Desert - bombolini was the highlight.

It seemed as if they initially brought in many managers probably from ""corporate"" to insure the service was on-point and it sure was.  Fast forward to last night. I called ahead to let them know I was entertaining a very important client and requested that we sit in a section where the service would be top notch.  Of course we had the opposite experience, we had to continuously search for our waiter, drinks were brought to the table incomplete and one person was always waiting for their drink while the others had theirs.  We asked for more bread, it never came.  All of the courses seemed rushed, the main course took forever to arrive.  I had such high hopes but part of what makes a restaurant great is consistency.  Maybe the place is just too big to expect this, but last night was a big disappointment.  The food was just ok, some of it was hot, other mains room temperature.  Everything we asked for we had to wait and wait.

Once our waiter came to take our order we began to tell him which two pastas we each wanted.  And then he told us that we could only select two pastas for all 3 of us to share! (and there would be enough food for all of us)  We told him that was not how it's done in Italy.  A ""bis"" is for an individual, not for sharing.  When reading the menu, we really did not understand why it said ""with the participation of the entire table"".  We interpreted this as ""every person has to order two pastas"".  That did not make much sense because of our experience in Italy, each person who orders a ""bis"" is not dependent on anyone else's order.  As a matter of fact, one of the purposes of a ""bis"" in Italy is so that you don't have to share with others - you just get more variety on your own plate!  We wound up just ordering individual dishes of pasta, which were all excellent!",0,1,0,Peter M.,"Bronx, NY",6,8,9

It made a conversation with my friends rather difficult. The screaming child on the table next to us didn't help.My main complaint about La Sirena is the service. It was slow, unprofessional and chaotic at best. We were given courses with missing ingredients, the waiters didn't know where to put the butter plates (it's either left or right - not one person on the left and the other on the right), it was a constant pain to get someones attention (bear in mind that the dining room was almost empty at this point) and waiters consistently put courses in front of the wrong diners. Overall food was good. If service was on point I'd probably give them 4 stars. Portions were huge and quality was good. But the service really made it difficult to enjoy the evening. By the time we got to desert our whole party was just annoyed by the chaos and the constant effort to get someones attention. They were busy with cleaning up the dining room and prepping it for the next day. I understand that this place is rather new, although it has been open for more than 2 months now, so service should have improved. Can't imagine dining here the opening week. But it's not Batali's / Bastianich's first restaurant, so they should be able to figure it out.",1,0,0,Tom K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0

I tend to appreciate foods that are naturally flavorful or lightly seasoned..however in this experience, I felt the food was quite bland with the exception of the crispy mortadella and the bits of bottarga sprinkled atop Nonna's fried eggs. To be fair, I still licked the plates clean as I happened to be very hungry when I got there. Also I requested olive oil so I could add flavor to the dishes and finish my meal. The mortadella was very interesting - a side dish served in small chunks (or cubes) that were tasty (due to its pork fat) complemented the other brunch dishes well that were lacking.",0,0,0,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",105,441,3759

First and foremost 90% of the time I eat Italian food and being that my wife is Italian, I can assure you this is an honest Italian food review. We were 20 minutes late for our dinner reservation, so I called ahead and the staff had no issues with us being behind schedule. We were immediately greeted with smiles and ushered to our table. Decor is lavish with a white and black color theme. Really beautiful inside. Service was prompt, attentive and friendly and on top that we were not rushed. On to the food, we had the:* Short Rib Carpaccio and Primavera Cruda (delicious, not a thing I would change)* Buricotta with Preserved Lemon, Crushed Peas and Mint (100% perfect, wonderful flavors ORDER THIS)* Panzotti (very simple dish, but mind blowing at the same time)* Tonnarelli Neri (enjoyed this a lot, and they definitely did not skimp on the lobster)* Grilled Swordfish alla Messinese (Swordfish was done to perfection with really wonderful flavors)* Roasted Lamb (Saturday special, tender, juicy and flavored just right)* Pineapple Bomboloni  (simple dessert, but delightful and pineapple was NOT hard)* Pizzelle e Cioccolato (Wonderful. Chocolate gelato, yes please)* Baba al Campari (really great mix of flavors here nothing was overpowering..GET THIS)* Bottle of Rosso Di Montalcino (great wine list, wasn't overly huge and vast, had a great deal of variety. * Glass of Prosecco (bubbles, who doesn't love bubbles)Ask for Damiano he was an amazing waiter and make sure you tip him 20%I've read a lot of reviews for La Sirena and I can ensure you every dish was served warm, every dish was done perfectly, all food was seasoned just right and nothing was over powering or seasoned too much, service was 100% on point, music was fun, upbeat with a great track selection and crowd was attractive....a tad bit sceney, but that doesn't bother me. The negative reviews, listen I'm no fanboy of Mario, I didn't love Babbo. However, maybe people are expecting too much from Mario? Maybe they're judging him to harshly? Who knows. But, I can promise you a wonderful night out with family or friends or your significant other with FANTASTIC UNIQUE DISHES. If you leave unsatisfied then you might be crazy. And for those who think all Italian food is the same, then you my friend don't know what Italian food is or about. Oh and PEOPLE please make an effort to get slightly dressed up for dinner.

I was in NYC for a girls weekend and was excited to try his latest venture. I went there on Sunday (Mothers Day) with 4 people. However, the experience at La Sirena was mediocre. The bloody Mary was watery, the Mulberry Street' Omelette was bland and the Mezzi Rigatoni Carbonara was not creamy. Additionally, I tweeted my experience to @lasirenany and @mariobatali as I was hoping it would help improve the quality of the food and service but instead of following up with questions or responding to my tweet I was blocked from @mariobatali on Twitter.

3.0,5/1/2016,"""Situational Awareness"" is what the waitstaff lacks at this beautiful, brightly lit, addition to The Maritime hotel.I arrived on a rainy Sunday morning around 9:50 and the restaurant was fairly empty with about 8 customers and 3 waitstaff. As I sat, I watched the waiters move to and fro and not a single one noticed me rubbernecking for a damn menu until after about 10-15 minutes of being seated. Finally, Sirena C sweetly provided me with a menu and apologies. I had previously viewed the menu before arriving but I still took a quick 2 minute scan in case the online version was missing something. I zeroed in on the amaretti mascarpone pancakes with a side order of egg whites and a cappuccino. Usually, your beverage is brought out immediately, but not here. After about 15 minutes of waiting for my beloved coffee, I asked another waiter if he could check the status, when magically, it appeared. Too bad, right behind it also came my breakfast. I barley had any time to simply enjoy the perfectly whipped cappuccino for fear my food would get cold. The pancakes were fine, nothing to write home about. Basically, they were plain cakes with some mascarpone butter and tons of crumbled amaretti cookies atop. The eggs were great, but for $12 for two egg whites, I could have bought a dozen. Needless to say, after all of that, I still sat and waited forever for my check. Not only had I stopped eating, I sat the napkin down on the table and went to the restroom hoping that when I returned, the check would be there...um, no. Even when I stood up to put on my scarf and coat, did anyone notice me. Ok, I was the only black person eating and I have big, curly hair so I am quite noticeable....still no dice. I had to physically approach the hostess stand to request my check and then Sirena C. brought my check with apologies.

1.0,4/27/2016,"After forcing us to wait in the loud bar area for more than 15 minutes, I walked to the hostess (who asked us what our reservation name was under THREE times) and inquired what was taking so long in getting us a table (even though there were at least 7-8 tables completely open throughout the large space). Then lo and behold, a table was ready for us!Trying to wash the lame seating experience out of my mind, the waitress gave us a really nice breakdown of her fave dishes and so we took her on her suggestions and ordered the Buricotta Cheese, Short Rib Carpaccio, Artichoke and Poached Egg Frisee to share. Sadly every bite of every antipasti/salad was totally bland and we had to get some salt to make things taste like something... Ironically when we got our Tonnarelli Lobster & Panzotti pastas, it was overly salty and just a disappointment. Even though I liked our waitress (who never came back btw), her suggestions SUCKED!!By the time the plates were cleared (one guy picked up a plate, then put it back on the edge of our table - teetering on falling off and walked away, causing me to look at another server and openly say ""what's going on?!"" He swiftly cleared the plate and gave me a sheepish smile), I kind of told my friend that this was probably one of the worst dinners I've had in awhile with some of the most lacking training of it's staff.

We shared some excellent appetizers, including soft shelled crabs that were prepared perfectly, a really good mushroom salad and a very nice green salad.  The hand made spaghetti was excellent.  I had perfectly cooked duck breast.  My wife had very nice pasta.  The orate was good, but not great.  The broccoli rabe was excellent.  Our only tactical error was in ordering dessert.  We tried the cookie plate and it was a weird sampling of funny cookies.

2.0,4/25/2016,"KenScale: 6.5/10I love most neighborhoods in Manhattan, but Meatpacking is probably not one of my favorites, especially at nighttime. It just feels too clubby, with expensive bars, restaurants and clubs that often charge ridiculous prices and screen guests with big bouncers all over the entrance. Maritime Hotel is almost the epicenter of this scene where men in expensive-looking suits and women in short dresses (even in the winter) would hang out at La Bottega before heading over to Tao downstairs or some other swanky club nearby. Once the star chef Mario Batali and restaurateur Joe Bastianich decided to open a new restaurant in place of La Bottega, I was really hoping that they would bring fresh air to the neighborhood, going beyond a predictable Italian restaurant where people hang out just to hang out, not to eat serious food. While I've had mixed experience at chef Batali's famed Babbo, there is no denying that it has the distinctive color and swagger that made the restaurant so beloved by New Yorkers over a long period of time, and there was no denying that Del Posto is one of my absolute favorites in the city. How did La Sirena measure up to these restaurants? I'm sad (and upset) to report that it lacks any type of flair that would want to make me come back. I've come to this conclusion after visiting this restaurant twice in a single week (which has never happened before by the way). I was hoping that the kitchen would take more risks, but the food at La Sirena not only lacked imaginativeness but was also wildly inconsistent throughout. All my appetizers that I had tried were pedestrian, from the crispy soft shell crab with crushed potatoes, sweet garlic and chives that didn't taste so crispy, to quail with charred ramps, rhubarb vinaigreete and red mustard greens that was more or less forgettable. Only the anchovies with fennel had some semblance of flavor, but wasn't better by much. The pastas were also boring and not really memorable, either. My favorite was bucatini with spicy octopus that had the spicy kick and nice balance of flavor and texture. On the other hand, tonnarelli neri with lobster, ramps and lemony breadcrumbs turned out a bit dull in flavor, as were pici with sausage an escarole and leek and mascarpone stuffed panzotti. I was really starting to miss the absolutely decadent beef's cheek ravioli at Babbo. Even the entrees showed that the kitchen was just playing too safe, and execution was far from perfect. I always enjoy the meaty texture of grilled swordfish, but the one at La Sirena (cooked Sicilian style with olives, tomatoes, currants, capers, pine nuts and marjoram) turned out too soft in texture so I had to really question whether it was swordfish. Braised roll beef short rib with broccoli rabe and spicy bread crumbs was another unimpressive dish that really didn't have a lot of redeeming qualities. The desserts were slightly better. I did quite enjoy the classic ""grandma style"" pine nut tart with olive oil gelato that had the right amount of sweetness without going overboard, and thought the combination of frozen honey mousse and blood orange sorbetto in honey walnut semifreddo worked harmoniously together, even though citrus and Campari-soaked Neapolitan cake with bergamot, grapefruit and basil gelato was, again, boring. Overall, I really wasn't sure how involved chef Batali was to this new venture. Is the restaurant just borrowing his name? Does he even show up at the kitchen and sample various dishes? Despite these shortcomings, getting a reservation at La Sirena is still very difficult to come by, which is even more shocking when you see the gigantic dining space. I wasn't sure whether the restaurant was purposefully withholding reservations. I showed up at 7 p.m. on a Tuesday and was seated at the central bar area immediately without any wait. The Italian-centric wine list on the iPad is large (but pricey), and while the service was professional and attentive, it also felt somewhat distant. As you can imagine, it's the same Meatpacking crowd (I swear I saw at least half a dozen couples of old, rich-looking guys and their hot and slim mistresses), which has made my dining experience even more uncomfortable. La Sirena is probably the best place to just sit at the bar for drinks while munching on some snacks before a wild night elsewhere. As much as I respect chef Batali and his influence on Italian dining scene in the city, La Sirena doesn't deserve to be one of his trophy restaurants, at least not just yet.",12,5,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

The cheese was fresh and well made but again, the flavor wasn't anything dynamite.For a main course I have the cavetelli with short ribs. The short ribs were tough and chewy. The cavatelli was fine but I was wishing I had more of it. My friend had the ravioli with pancetta, tomato, and pecorino, and it was the star of the show. I would go back for that ravioli alone.Dessert was the bomboloni with pineapple. The donuts themselves were perfect but the pineapple and accompanying sauce were lackluster--sweet for sweet's sake without much flavor. The sauce drowns out the acidity of the pineapple.They have a great wine selection--my pinot noir by the glass was very tasty and perfect.Overall I'm not sure I'll go back--maybe for a different season's menu, but I'd really rather go to Babbo, Eataly or Del Posto.",3,3,4,Christina C.,"New York, NY",84,74,7

I say he is incorrect and the hostesses knew that we were all here for 30 minutes.  He NEVER says I'm sorry and just walks away.  That is the last we see of him - besides the multiple times he walks by throughout the rest of our experience, but never stops by to apologize or offer any type of consolation.  Now it's 2:55 and they finally ready to seat us.  Everyone is pissed and our happy birthday celebration has taken a bad turn.  We sit down at the table, no one comes.  5 minutes later we finally ASK for our menus.  We get the menus...no one comes.  There's plenty of people working in the dining room, but no one seems to care that we are sitting there waiting intently to order something - anything at this point.  I finally flag down a waiter (seriously?) and ask if he can take our oder.  It's sometime after three at this point and we put in the entire order - drinks, apps, entrees - we have had PLENTY of time to decide.  Another 20 minutes goes by and we get our bread basket...but still no drinks.  I ask the waiter about them - says they are coming.  It took 30 minutes to get drinks so I order another when they arrive because surely I will be done by the time my next is ready - my thoughts were correct.My partner complains again to the hostess as she walks by - he is received warmly, but it seems that his words fell on deaf ears.  The manager NEVER stops by.  I am aghast.  One would think a round of drinks would be offered - dessert perhaps?  Nope.The food comes - by this point we are all so over this experience that we'd be happier at the diner around the corner.  The food was fine - mediocre at best.  Portions were unsurprisingly small, eggs when ordered ""runny"" came out hard - too late to complain at this point as we are ready to eat the tablecloth.We inhale our food and the waiter brings over the single dessert offering - we order one piece that we are charged for - they put a candle in it.  We pay the bill - not a thing was comped, not even an apology was spent on us.  As we leave we ask for the manager's card - one would think this was a simple request.  The hostess tries to skirt the issue and give us the generic card for the restaurant - or leave to go get the manager's permission (who obviously didn't give a damn and is literally sitting 10 feet away).  We said we didn't have time and would contact him in writing because the rest of our party was waiting outside.  She leaves to speak to the manager and we vent to the other two hostesses and demand his card which they produced immediately.It's not like we were a table of delinquents or people who don't know how to handle themselves.  We are all successful New Yorkers - two fashion designers, an architect, two art dealers, a branding genius, and a food stylist.  Many of us worked in restaurants in our youth - we know how it works (or is supposed to).This was a major fail for the Batali empire - we will not be returning nor will we have anything good to say about La Sirena.",1,0,0,Barrett W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0

Our meals were the Testa all Milanese topped w Arugula and it was really done to perfection ... and the Beef Braciole w Broccoli Rabe - it was spicy, but tender and juicy.  Finished the meal with a fruit plate including dragon fruit and Baba al Campari - light and delicious and it went excellent with the smooth white port.   The staff was super attentive but not annoying.  The place is very good looking  and enjoyable - it is spacious and we were definitely not feeling rushed.",3,0,0,Denise S.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,49,68

4.0,4/3/2016,"My husband and I had an excellent dinner at La Sirena last night.  We had a performance at 8 pm and had an early reservation, so it was quieter than you might experience later in the evening on a weekend.  The decor is stunning. The bar area is particularly attractive though we were seated in an adjacent dining room at a table next to the floor to ceiling windows. The view is only of the projects across the street but it's light and airy and we can tell that they'll probably offer outdoor dining once the weather improves.  The windows were double glazed so we weren't cold despite the chill outside.   Our young Italian waiter, Damiano, was personable and attentive as was the rest of the team  serving us.  There were a couple of minor service missteps but we were satisfied overall.The food was truly excellent!  I had tender flavorful arctic char crudo and my husband had the melt-in-your-mouth short rib Carpaccio.  We split an order of the ravioli filled with tomato and pecorino in a spring onion sauce.  The ravioli were delicate and totally scrumptious.  For our main courses, I had the grilled lamb chops and my husband the Polpette (pork meatballs).  The meatballs were exceptionally soft and tasty, the lamb chops perfectly cooked, tender and delicious.  I enjoyed the crudo with a glass of he Oltrepo Pavese Brut, a very good Italian sparkling wine that also complemented the ravioli, and matched the lamb with a glass of hearty Barolo.  We weren't hungry but had to try the gelato so we shared chocolate and pistachio flavors.  I wasn't impressed with the pistachio but the chocolate was good. I finished with espresso which was served with a small biscotti and a tiny parfait glass filled with whipped cream and topped with a coffee bean coated with chocolate.We still prefer Del Posto in this neighborhood, however La Sirena is a good alternative at a lower price.  We plan to return to try more of the menu items.",4,0,0,Barbara M.,"New York, NY",8,87,0

5.0,4/2/2016,"If could give half stars would rate this 4.5 as overall very good but couple glaring weaknesses.First the food. All was very good as enjoyed quail, rabbit and swordfish. I did find swordfish a bit overcooked and the sauce overpowered the fish. Loved the semolina bread. Not many vegetarian options.You better know your Italian wines as have a tablet with many pages worth of choices.  The kerner by the glass was good. The wine list varied from 40 to 240 dollars. Tablet allowed you to like wines as you went so did not have to flip around.Service was good as lost track of how many people served us and sommelier stopped by twice. Had to wait 15 minutes for table but considering very popular as just opened that is okay.  Customers could easily go between 1 to 5 courses so hard to judge when tables will open. Seemed to be easy for parties of 2 to eat in bar area. The couple things I wish they did was since place so huge it gets very loud.  Many other places add design features like putting slated drop ceilings or slightly protruding wall features to dampen the noise.  Also add sambucca to liquors they offer in tablet or dessert menu.Overall great place as went when location was la bottega and can tell spent fortune to open this.  I am sure batali is no where in the kitchen but will return though maybe on weekday when likely less noisy.",2,1,0,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",179,395,788
4.0,3/31/2016,"I was actually quite surprised by how much I liked it here. I saw the reviews and I was expecting MUCH worse. Yes it is expensive and yes the service is not the BEST buuuuuut it's not as bad as everyone makes it seem but my review is slightly biased BECAUSE 1) i didn't pay for dinner 2) I was with a party that's friends with someone in the kitchen. The four star rating is still legit though and I justify it with ONE thing and that one thing over powers everything else...THE PASTA IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yes that good. If you go do the bis (pasta share for the table)What we hadCrudo (red snapper this evening) with watermelon radish and something else I don't remember but it was fresh and delicious.Artichoke app was boring bland and just don't order itBuricotta was good but the crushed peas and mint was bleh to me I did not like it with the cheese, maybe with a light fish or something but not with cheese. Bad comboCalamari was amazing. Grilled to perfection still soft and tender barely need to chew it, just sort of falls into your teeth.Quail app was amazing! Even the vinegary rhubarb purée underneath it complimented the quail and ramps perfectly. I love ramps!Bucatini alla arrabiata HOLY MOTHER OF ... Absolutely by far the BEST arrabiata sauce I have ever had anywhere including Italy! The sauce is spicier than most but seems so balanced on your palate by the tomato sauce. Something about the sauce screams perfection! And the bucatini was perfectly chewy with that al dente crunch in the core. This dish is a must if you dine hereCavatelli ,...again... The best cavatelli I have ever had!! The spare ribs remind of this Korean spare rib dish my grandma makes, the seasoning on it was exactly the same. It was perfectly salted and the cavatelli was cooked perfectly as well with that center crunch and chewy outside. This is WHY I give 4 starsBranzino served with radish and something green I couldn't figure out what the slaw completely consisted of but it was amazing!! The green purée thing they poured on the side was meh I could def do without it but the slaw with branzino was the perfect accompaniment. The branzino was prepared just right but we did find quite a bit of bones after they deboned it.Steak was a big disappointment to me, the end pieces my friends state were really good and seasoned well but the way they sliced the cuts of meat had very little surface space and the seasoning was not consistent: random bland bites of mean then random super salty bites. I also got several bites of tendons or something that were so tough I couldn't chew it and had to spit it out. Cheesy potato balls that came with the steak-LITERALLY tastes like a cheez-it, I swear!Cauliflower side was super salty to me but I think it was the cheese or something they put it in.Pineapple dessert was my faveThe grandma something dessert... Tart? Pretty good, loved the pine nuts in it. Not too sweet which I love. Not a huge super sweet fan.I can't remember the other dessert we got but they make a decent espresso, seemed on the weaker side but tasted good.CocktailsGold rush, it's not on the menu. But if you know your cocktails it's a classic. The bartender made a perfect one.There can only be one (I think that's was it was called) is basically a gold rush but made with highland 12 yr and it sounded like a good choice but the smokeyness of the highland does not complement honey and citrus. It's too much of a contradiction in the worst way possibleClassic negroni was good but they're version which is on the menu had this weird sweet beginning with a bad bitter end not a good kind of bitter, again too contradicting.Service: good. Our waiter seemed like he was too busy and not in the best mood. Not mean but not really happy. We did send back two drinks but we weren't nasty about it, we were very nice and one was because he messed up the order. The servers were awesome the bartenders was awesome everyone else was pretty much awesome. Our waiter just seemed like he was over it, not a bad waiter by any means, just not cheerful. Overall: go for the pasta but be prepared to spend $$$$$$$$$$$, it's reaaaaallllllyyyyy expensiveRandom side note the bar stools are THE MOST comfortable seats ever!

5.0,3/30/2016,"his week's fashionplate features our brand new Fall/Winter 2016/17 eyelash sweater at the new Batali resto in the Maritime Hotel. I love going to places that are close to my apartment and have been wanting to check out La Sirena for a while.  After an event I was starving and in need of wine and we found ourselves at the luxe spacious bar sipping some wine while waiting for a table to open up.  Once we were seated my dining companion and I decided to try a few things.  We started with the fresh buricotta which is a decadent and creamy cheese that melted in my mouth.   We also got the crudo which was standard and fresh.  I'm a pasta/carb whore so I had to go in for it and get at least two.  The cavatelli with spare ribs was hearty and delicious.  We also adored the panzotti with leeks, cheese and a brown butter sauce, totally my kind of pasta dish.  We rounded the meal out with the duck breast medium rare which was also great.  All in all it was a great Italian meal where I needed to be carted out of the resto, thank god it's a short walk home.  I definitely will be back to check out brunch outside now that it's getting warmer.This place gets packed so if you don't want to wait I would make a reservation even though it's a large space.  The crowd is lots of trendy twenty and thirty-somethings plus some older business dinners and tourists.  Definitely dress to impress.",8,4,5,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7

3.0,3/26/2016,"Such high hopes for this new Mario Batali restaurant.  It opened 5 months late and was allegedly way over budget, as most openings are. Such is life in NYC with new restaurants. We are big fans and love most everything else by Chef Batali. Our gut reaction to our experience is, completely underwhelmed. The service was not up to par but when we found out that they have only been open for 6 weeks, we began to somewhat reconsider.  The pace was extremely slow and everyone else around seemed to get a lot more attention than us. We constantly had to ask other members of the staff for things like napkins and dessert menus. We were given dinner sized plates with our appetizers and weren't offered bread until just before our pastas arrived, while everyone had been offered it long before. All of that aside, the food...  For appetizers we had the burrata and vongole orreganata which were both very good. We had two pastas, the bucatini and the pici. The bucatini was good but the pici left much to be desired. The sausage and escarole weren't very flavorful. If they were going for extremely subtle flavors then cudos, but I was expecting more. When we learned from the manager Joe that they have only been open for 6 weeks we decided to assume that the lack of excellent service is growing pains and not racism.  Joe was amazingly do was the only saving grace of this experience. He could sense our frustration with our experience and took care of our drinks. He offered other things to appease us but we were over it and just ready to go at that point. We plan to go back once a little time has passed. We really want this restaurant to be excellent and succeed. We'll see...  Stay tuned.",0,1,0,Lenny W.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,80,70

The short ribs were definitely my favorite for the night, but by then I was so full I could only muster a few bites.

We sat in the dining room and learned they were only serving brunch. Snacks and drinks doesn't equal brunch in my mind. I wish the hostesses had let us know that. We ordered drinks and toast with prosciutto. The waitress came back and said she learned the kitchen closed at 3:30. (So why did they seat us after 3:30?) She did say they would take care of us. (Good call.) Having said all that, the drinks and food were fabulous. The place is beautiful - pictures don't do it justice. It really is lovely.

We grabbed a drink at the bar (which is really nice!) and waited for a table. It seems like the restaurant is still gearing up - there is a huge balcony which isnt being used yet (im sure it will be packed during the summer), and there seems to be a LOT of open space in the restaurant. Almost too barren. They can fit 2x the number of tables than there are currently. For now though, its nice that it isnt too crowded and im sure the service is better as a result. You also don't feel like you are sitting on top of the tables next to you -- you can have a full conversation and not be concerned about other people hearing. The food was good, but not GREAT. It was solid. I've had better italian food in NY recently. But La Sirena isnt just about the food for me, its about the neighborhood, proximity to other activities, and the space.

It started with us waiting for our table for 30 min. Maitre d was unhelpful. There may have been 20 staff members walking around all night from waiters, hosts, bus boys, & managers. Everyone at our table kept calling someone over to ask for something whether it bread or drinks or anything! There is no customized service and it's a mess in here. Dirty Dishes sat on our table for too long, no one asks if u want a second drink (again u have to call them over constantly). I hate that feeling of no service in a new and pricey restaurant.

The price point is entirely out of line with the quality that is provided. Despite the over-the-top service, the food is on par with Italian you'd find at your local strip mall.

I am not sure why but I wasn't expecting it to be as fancy as it was. Luckily it was loud so when he was babbling aggressively no one noticed. We started with the grilled calamari and burrata which were both very good but a little on the small side. We had ordered a lot of food though so it turned out to be better for us we didn't overeat before the pasta course. We got the spicy octopus pasta as well as the short rib cavatelli and my son got handmade pasta with butter (he has since refused my boxed Annie's Mac and cheese. Jk) All were amazing. I liked the short rib better and my husband liked the octopus. Then (I told you we got a lot) we shared the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly! Service was excellent.

My favorite dishes were pasta, especially the pici, but the orata (which I ordered at our server's suggestion) was delightful too.  My dining companions all raved about their food as well.  And the atmosphere was sophisticated and chic yet laid back at the same time.  This may be my new favorite restaurant in the city.  Bravo!",3,0,1,Caroline M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,27,0
4.0,2/29/2016,"Super sexy La Sirena shimmers in the Maritime Hoel. While La Bottega rocked the Italian nautical theme La Sirena is sleek, shiny and sophisticated. A stellar location for Batali and company. I have drunk at the bar and dined for breakfast. Breakfast my pets is one of my favorite meals of the day and it is divine here.Ate: Far fresh eggs with fingerling potatoesFresh squeezed blood orange juiceMacchiatoIt is so fab dining in the fancy dining room solo which I was on Saturday at 8Am, but surely not for long. Fresh squeezed blood orange juice is an indulgent treat. Fresh eggs with tasty fingerlings, caramelized onions and a dollop of tomato sauce, a little, fine Machiato was tasty. Would love to see a larger selection of sweets sold separately other than just a Cornetto- still a solid spot for a fine breakfast at the Maritime.",14,2,7,Franny A.,"New York, NY",865,1322,1125
2.0,2/26/2016,"The space is very pretty and spacious. The service was good although I feel the waiters and waitresses need to become more versed with the items on the menu.  For example, our waitress was mispronouncing dishes.  The server was pouring a green sauce on my friends dish and she asked what it was and he replied he didn't know. On to the food... We shared burrata, grilled calamari and got the branzino for two. The grilled calamari was very small. It was mostly broccoli and cauliflower with a few pieces of calamari. The branzino was very good. It says on the menu it comes with the crunchy salad and stinging nettles( the server didn't know what this was). It's not even a salad but a few garnishes on top of the fish. I personally don't like a green sauce on my plate and that was the stinging nettles.  I believe it's puréed spinach so I skipped that. So my entree basically consisted of a piece of branzino with some leaves on top( that is called a salad). They should change what comes with the branzino to make the dish more substantive. The branzino is 70 bucks for two so it's not cheap. Wound up ordering a side of broccoli rabe and there was a miscommunication so came out way after we finished entree. They took it off the bill so that was good. One last thing the bread. It's a seeded Italian bread that comes out piping hot. It looks delicious but it's not at all. It tastes like hot white bread. I would totally comeBack for drinks but not dinner!",3,0,0,Lisa P.,"New York, NY",0,15,0

Didn't even finish it - server was gone for a very long time-A manager took our check (very tall skinny man) but no eye contact, just a mumble ""thank you""",3,0,1,Chelsea A.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",15,57,11

3.0,2/20/2016,"It's just OK... I love Mario Batali's restaurants and think he personally is a great guy. Fact is, this gorgeous new restaurant was pretty mediocre in the food department and significantly overpriced, in my local New Yorker opinion. It's more corporate card-carrying, tourist hotspot than neighborhood regulars' restaurant. The pros: -The cocktails! True craftsmanship and creativity. I ordered one cocktail on the menu and one off. The bartender's creativity had me liking the off-menu cocktail even more. $17 each. -Service was excellent too! This is important. -Gorgeous (and huge!!) space. The mosaic marble floors are stunning and carry through to the huge outdoor terrace.The cons: -Price! 3 meatballs, $24. They came highly-recommended by our server. The meatballs were fine; they tasted like meatballs. $22 glasses of cab-least expensive cab by the glass. I can go on about this but if the price was more realistic it's a 4 star restaurant.All in all, this is not a restaurant for New Yorkers who want a place to go on a regular basis. It is in the Meatpacking District after all. La Sirena is what you would expect in ""MePa"" and will attract that douche crowd. It's simply not for me and I'll stick to Otto and some of the other lower-key Batali restaurants I've grown to love over the years.To be fair, I went on day 8 of their opening. It's NYC and I don't foresee their prices getting cheaper but do hope the food gets tastier. Wish them the best of luck.",8,0,1,Jimmy Z.,"New York, NY",1,60,13
5.0,2/16/2016,"Got a reservation there on opening night - beautiful restaurant, professional staff, the Viola hendricks/prosecco cocktail is delicious. In the dining room, service like clockwork - already a well oiled machine - Kelsey, our server, was delightful. I recommend the Alici with Fennel 3 ways - stupendous...If you think you don't like fennel, try this: it will change your life. The pasta with veal tripe and celery remains on my taste buds to this day, and the branzino was perfect (although I see half a charred lemon on another reviewer's picture- we did not get the lemon :-((( Also very notable: the wine list - an impressive selection at unbelievably reasonable prices. Some expensive one too, but the beverage director was not pushy and his selection was spot on.Can't wait to go back!",3,0,0,Sylvie F.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,10,0
4.0,2/16/2016,"Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali's newly-opened jointly-founded restaurant. This was a highly-anticipated meal, after hearing that this would open in Fall 2015, so we were glad to finally get the chance to try this. Not to mention, La Sirena is a 2-minute walk from my apartment, so getting there during the snow and wind would prove to be a breeze (no pun intended).I managed to get a last-minute reservation for President's Day, after unsuccessfully trying to get one for Valentine's Day. The ambiance is very trendy and modern, consistent with the neighboring Tao Downtown and adjacent Maritime Hotel. Even in business casual attire, I actually felt mildly under-dressed, likely because of the hyper-attractive hostesses and the many roaming FOH managers in suits. Oh well. While waiting for our table, I sat at the huge bar in the lobby, which was brightly lit and stocked with all sorts of ingredients. The cocktail menu was very inventive, and I started off with the Spicy Little Number, which was Stranahan's whiskey, ancho chile liqueur, and pear juice. The drink was spicy, sweet, and strong, and all very well-balanced, complete with the clear perfectly sculpted square ice cubes. After that, I went with my usual old-fashioned, which was also expertly-made, and very, very strong. I was definitely feeling it after 2 drinks, but I maintained my composure. Somewhat. The hostess led us to the main dining area through the archway to the left of the bar. I saw that there was a whole dining area to the right of the bar, but I'm assuming that will be open later. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable, and very patient with our questions. After waiting at the bar for a substantial amount of time and drinking up an appetite, we kinda went crazy with our order.What we ordered:- Short Rib Carpaccio: Tiny portion, but still absolutely delicious, and loaded with black truffle- Duck Mezzalune with Marinara: On the salty side, but very hearty and rich, loaded with duck- Bucatini with Polipo all'Arrabbiata: Pasta had the perfect chew, and very tender octopus- Beef Braciole with Broccoli Rabe and spicy bread crumbs: Short rib was braised nicely, and the bread crumbs provided a great crunchy contrast- Brasato di Vitello (Veal Brisket) with potato puree & salsa verde: Delicious and fatty, especially with the salsa verde- Cauliflower Carbonara: creamy, tender, and full of delicious pancetta bits- Honey Walnut Semifreddo: A very interesting and unique mix of different textures and flavors including orange sorbet and candied fennelService, as previously mentioned, was excellent with recommendations, ensuring that we were confident in our choices, and that our drinks were quickly refilled. I was very impressed with the pace and how smoothly everything went throughout the meal, again, given that it's only been a few days. The prices are easily on the expensive side, so perhaps it's not the place to frequent, but definitely good for a nice dinner. The cocktails were delicious and well-made, but at about $16-18 a cocktail, incredibly pricey, so keep that in mind if you're going to the bar for drinks.Reservations are taken up to 15 days ahead of time, only through the phone for now. I'm very keen to try their brunch/lunch menu, once it's finally available. Obviously, as it is early days, I'll be interested to see how everything evolves with La Sirena, both menu-wise and service-wise, and I'm certain it will happen quickly. Regardless, after having such an excellent experience, I will definitely be back again for date night or perhaps, some other special occasion.",65,37,54,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792
4.0,2/15/2016,"I loved the space, but the entire experience was very interesting. This is what I mean by interesting: After we got sat, we had to wait a little under 10 min for someone to bring us a menu and water.  After the menus came, the waitress started reciting the highlights and the titles in the menu from memory, as if it wasn't all written in the menu already. I love that the menu includes descriptions and prices, as most upscale places think it's cute to leave out details in their menu, not the case at La Sirena, they were very thorough with everything. After that awkward menu presentation where the lady recited what was already on the page, we were brought a bread basket with butter on the side topped with sea-salt - another great touch, because we were starving at this point. After four people came to our table (different people were : the hostess, water, bread, menus) we were finally able to order from our waitress (fifth person to come to our table)  There were too many people for no reason in the small area we were in.  The waitress gave us her advice when we asked, and she gave her approval of certain dishes, too- very knowledgable staff.We ordered the fried seafood and veggies to start- It was very delicious. Too small- with only a few pieces of calamari, 1 jumbo shrimp, and a few pieces of veggies-  but the special lemony/citrus sauce was delicious!!  For the pasta / primi dish, we ordered the cavatelli semolina pasta, which included small pieces of pork spare ribs in tomato sauce- the BEST choice of the evening - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLATE!!  The second plates we ordered were the special of the day on Sunday and the duck. The special of the day was basically fried pork skin (for any Latinos reading this, the chicharrón on the menu is actually what you would expect chicharrón to be). The waitress explained what it was before I confirmed my order and I still went ahead with it thinking I'd love the fried pork shoulder.  When it came out, the dish was garnished with what looked like pork rinds from a bag of potato chips, and the actual meat itself was too much juicy/undercooked fat for me so I didn't finish it.  My partner's next plate was the DUCK with swiss chard. When the duck came out we tried it, and it felt like we were in heaven. I'll definitely go back for the cavatelli, and the duck and maybe to try something more basic like the chicken, but I did not enjoy the chicharrones.  We were too full for dessert, so I'm definitely going back to try their desserts. tl;dr- The long wait to get the menus was awkward, but the DUCK and the CAVATELLI was worth it all in the end.",6,1,0,James T.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",52,6,1
4.0,2/14/2016,Made reservation for 10pm. Waited 30 mins to get seated.Check-in ladies need improvement. A smile would be nice. 6 ladies at checkin and more interested in chatting with each other than giving customers better attention. Felt like trying to get into a club rather than a restaurant. Little black dress with gold belt on the hostesses enforced the club feel.Bar area is very nice and large. Bar staff were efficient and made good drinks as expected.Dining room felt small coming in from the bar. Dining room staff were friendlier and efficient with crisp and professional looking uniform.Menu has large and affordable selections. Dry aged rib eye was good. Desserts were great.Mostly young and out of town clientele. Nice energy. No doubt will be very popular hang out place which has something for everyone.,7,0,1,U C.,"New York, NY",0,6,0
5.0,2/13/2016,This place just opened on February 11th. I go to every new restaurant that opens in New York City. This place was magnificent and the service was great! One of the better grand openings I have attended. I also like the cold antipasto station that the person will actually cut the dried sausage in front of you.
