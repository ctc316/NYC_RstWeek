1.0,4/26/2019,"My friend and I came here for happy hour after hearing really good things. This place is a complete disaster. There is no waiting list for happy hour. It is first come first serve and you can only get happy hour at the bar. The place gets packed and we got there at 5 Pm which is early after a work day. I couldn't relax with my wine because I felt like I was constantly looking for people who were about to get up from the bar. We finally got a seat and ordered two drinks, calamari and oysters. It took forever, over 40 min for us to get the calamari. When we followed up with our server Giovanni he seemed annoyed that we were asking where it was and said it ""wasn't ready"". For a place looking to usher people out very quickly 40 minutes felt unacceptable. We also asked for a side of marinara which never came and also seemed like an annoying request. While the food was good, there are many other places with a better happy hour deal in the area. We won't be returning.",0,0,0,Bethann C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,40,12

Giovanni is one of the best bartenders in midtown and comes up with a lot of cocktails, even making up ones on the spot going by your tastes. Smoked oysters Rockefeller are my favorite which I get without the breadcrumbs and they are out if this world!! Seafood Cobb, shrimp scampi appetizer and the lobsters are always a must try as well!

3.0,4/2/2019,"More of a 3 1/2 stars.  Looking forward to happy hour and 1$ oysters and drink specials at the bar.  I didn't realize the place would be so jammed.  So we bit the bullet and got a table which i knew would run the bill 4X more.  I got the dozen oyster special, at almost $4 per oyster (compared to $1 at the bar) and a salad.  My partner got the mussels and frites. The mussels and frites were just ok, some of the frites a little soggy, and the mussels in a spicy marineire, which should not have been spicy . It was definitely not french and contained no herbs.  I've had alot better and alot less expensive.  The oysters were small, and so disappointing.  The salad was ok, but not crispy as advertised.  All in all, would I go back for dinner?  No.  Might I try the happy hour, but on a weekend when there would be muh less of a crowd.  The waitperson was lovely, but only checked on us once and never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks, a bloody mary and a red wine.  The Malbec was non-descript and lacked body.  The Bloody Mary was too thin for my taste and was over spiced.",0,0,0,Jerry F.,"Manhattan, NY",87,184,18

2.0,3/22/2019,"I've had much better service and food at less expensive establishments. That being said I have absolutely no issue paying a hefty price for good food and better service.We popped for happy hour snacks and oysters. You have to sit at the bar to order from the HH menu. It's extremely packed and hard to get a seat. You have to wait a while but finally, a couple of stools became available.Being that it was HH and they are busy it takes a while for a bartender to come over. When she did, she had asked what we would like to drink. I drink sparkling water so I asked if they had a bottle. She said that they filter the water there and make it sparkling. Essentially a soda stream. Little did I know that they were going to charge me $6 for a bottle of water. (I honestly could care less, I just would of liked to know that the water was going to cost more than the snacks we got) I got the fish tacos, deviled eggs and the calamari. Tacos were decent. Nothing special. Deviled eggs were pretty good. The calamari was doused in the sweet chili dipping sauce that you buy at the grocery store. It was pretty gross. Too much of the cheap sauce was on the calamari. I had to flag down a manager who apologized and took it off the bill. All in all. Maybe the drinks make the HH better than the weak service and sub-par food.",1,0,1,Jayson C.,"New York, NY",1039,246,1209
2.0,3/14/2019,"Completely random, we decided to check out Docks. The menu looked interesting and it was seemingly quite packed. When we walked in the energy was through the roof. We instantly got swept up and overtaken by this feeling of ""this is the place to be. We need to be here.""Then the food came and we experienced the less than stellar service, and we wanted to be anywhere but there. It was awful. And then we realized the energy had fizzled out because apparently it was from the happy hour crowd that dashed when the cheap booze was no longer flowing... and I assumed before they sobered up and saw Docks for what it was: an overpriced relic with bad oysters.  Perhaps if we were drinkers, the might have been better or seemed worthy. But,we weren't a d it wasn't. The place is very large, and definitely gives the air that at some point, it used to be something. We decided to only sample some appetizers. We started with a dozen oysters. I'm sorry, I dine on oysters once or twice a week and these fell short of even the lowest quality of places that don't pretend to have a top line raw bar. The truth was that raw bar consisted of an empty ice display in the very back of the restaurant, away from most diners. And the rest was made up up of a two by two space crammed in at the front of the bar, where they have someone making sushi rolls, many of which would sit there for no less than 10 minutes before a waiter would come and get it. The calamari tasted like something you'd expect at a cheap fast food place. Definitely not what I'd expect at a $$$ restaurant. We had to send that back. The deviled eggs were okay. I'm still amused by their $6 house sparkling water. Words can't express how fast we went from excited and energized to thoroughly disgusted and wanting to leave as soon as possible, which we did. It was so bad, I ended up getting fries from Shake Shack when we got to Grand Central. With bad experiences at Jane and Sarabeth in January, this is the third strike on dining at any of these sister restaurants for awhile.",1,0,0,J. Lawrence N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",954,135,1224

1.0,2/25/2019,This is the first review I ever felt so moved to write. The reason is because our dinner was so god awful. I have eaten at Docks for many years. We've always loved the fact that they served great fish and seafood with sides and and desserts that met all our needs. We often brought friends and out of town guests for a comfortable and joyfully satisfying experience. Admittedly it has been a while since our last time there as we often have lobster at The Palm. But we wanted more space and cheerful atmosphere for great dinner. The Boston clam chowder was tasteless. The grilled salmon a disappointment as well. I orderd the seafood salad with lobster and crab. Horrible! It lacked all but a bite full of something that may have been a piece of lobster and a shrimp. We ordered dessert but it's not even worth criticizing. Docks is definitely over. I give them one star because my cosmopolitan cocktail was perfect and I needed it to deal with the shame of bringing my guests.,0,0,0,Judi L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,2/24/2019,"I was here for restaurant few years ago and the food didn't impress me. My friends and I went back recently for their happy hour special. Oysters and clams were $1/piece so we ordered 7 dozens of oysters, a dozen of clams, few sliders, calamari, fish tacos, and wines. The food was okay but the oysters and clams weren't that fresh. It obviously didn't sit well in my stomach.",0,0,0,Serenity G.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,16,19

Arrived 20 minutes before the estimated time, which was great. However, what I received for $33 ($45 when tax tip and delivery included) was a small soggy dressing drenched uncharred unremarkable kale salad with a small scattering of radish and carrot slices and some kind of cheese (Swiss? Cheddar) slivers. No char, no mango, no cashews, no plantains. Salmon was good but small for the additional $17.

2.0,2/16/2019,"Came here for brunch with 6 friends. I asked about a few of the items and whether they were gluten-free, the server was not helpful and simply gave a short ""no"" to my questions and gave no suggestions. Ordered the seasonal frittata. It had no flavor, I had to dump salt and pepper on it to get anything to taste like it had some semblance of flavor. Our server was very inattentive, our table was never pre bussed, he never checked if we wanted more bread or drinks, which we did, our waters were empty for almost our entire meal (and the one time they got filled after we asked him, he grabbed our glasses by the lip with his hands. Later I saw him quickly pick a booger and continue putting in and taking orders without washing his hands) and we waited for 20 minutes to get our check after our table was cleared.",0,0,0,Alexandra N.,"Atlanta, GA",128,9,1
2.0,2/14/2019,"2.5/5 - I've been coming to Docks regularly with family for over 10 years and have always loved this place as a go-to classy seafood restaurant experience. An emphasis was always placed on top tier service, food and an overall enjoyable experience you felt satisfied walking away from. Unfortunately tonight that really changed and has me questioning my interest to return after coming in for a late dinner (8:30pm reservation on a Thursday). However, I felt like a 17 year old walking into a Maserati dealership (I'm 31) as we were looked at and subsequently treated like we weren't going to tip from the minute we walked in (I'm noticing this is not the first review to state a similar experience). Although our server was very polite, the actual service was almost non-existent. We were sparingly checked in on, often looking around having to flag our server down.We knew we wanted oysters from the start and ordered them when we got to the table, along with drinks. The drinks took 15 minutes to get to us (which were subpar, one even had to be returned), the oysters another 10-15 after. For an oyster bar, you think they could get a $43 array of a dozen oysters together quicker than 25-30 minutes.The meal proceeded to take almost an hour to get to us after that, not even getting our food until closer to 10pm. The food itself was fine, but not the quality of freshness I've become accustomed to at Dock's. Combined with the painfully extended delay, slow service, and (now in my opinion) overpriced food, it was just not the experience I was hoping for, catching a price tag of over $225 for 2.Just not the experience I was hoping for and based on other reviews, unfortunately this restaurant has just fallen into the depths of another overpriced, underwhelming NYC restaurant.",0,0,0,Andrew F.,"New York, NY",234,74,85
3.0,2/11/2019,"Came to Dock's for a work lunch. The restaurant is quite large and conveniently located by Grand Central. Our server wasn't very warm. About 45 minutes went by after ordering and our food was nowhere to be found. We asked if she could check on the food and immediately it came out. My Lobster Roll was good but overpriced at $32 for lunch. The Baked Oysters were tasty, but only 4 came out on the plate.

3.0,2/6/2019,"Review Time: I work down the street from this joint. The restaurant was huge which would be perfect to throw a birthday or Holiday party. As we sat down, the water gave us water. Something was stuck on the inside of the glass, so he was like ""have this water (which there was one next to me waiting for a coworker to drink). To be honest, the service sucked, I couldn't count how many times we flagged down the waiter. The food was good but not the greatest. It's a one in a life time experience to try their food experience.Food: Appetizer, it tasted great. I actually enjoyed the taste and texture of this dish. A lot of flavors were there. Lunch Entree,  first the meatballs were super dry and a little burnt. I couldn't taste the lamb which is one of my favorite tastes. The veggies were burnt which totally threw the dish off and ruined it for me. The squash purée was the only thing that hit the spot. Dessert, the flourless chocolate cake was good but a little too much, so I advise you to share with a friend or family member. Also pair it with red or white wine. For the restaurant, my advice is to eliminate the white crap and replace it with a raspberry sauce (you're welcome). Will I recommend this place to folks? Ehh, I'll think on it. Will I eat her again? No, I will be sitting at the bar during their HH because it close to my work.",0,0,0,Daniella L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,103,65
3.0,2/4/2019,"My friend always wants to go here whenever she is craving oysters. Then, she ends up being underwhelmed by the quality of the oysters. However, what can you expect from dollar oysters in midtown? During their happy hour, the drink menu is not that bad. However, there isn't anything ""oh so great."" The booze is okay and the oysters are whatever. It is a place I would probably go to just because my friends insist. Voluntarily, I don't think I'd go.

1.0,2/3/2019,"My experience at Docks today has been horrendous. I visited expecting a great lunch but I had a very negative experience. I'd heard good things about Docks from a relative but this place has definitely lost its charm.Upon arrival I waited 15 minutes before being greeted by my waiter. Immediately I was told I could only order from the VERY limited brunch menu (photographed), if I wanted to participate in restaurant week. I choose to order a burger and fries, which took 45 minutes to arrive and was only warm by the time it arrived.

1.0,1/27/2019,This is the worst restaurant I have been too in New York. Don't go here if you are a minority. Or if you are young. They are so judge mental and stereotype us.

2.0,1/25/2019,"We went to Dock's for lunch, partly because it was my birthday and partly because family was leaving town. I have been here often -we live and work nearby. I think what characterizes my experience over time is a tremendous inconsistency in the cuisine and dining experience at every level. it is sometimes excellent, but other times, as at my birthday, poor.Granted I went during a 'Restaurant Week'; but the whole point is to showcase and make fine restaurants affordable and permit one to sample at a new restaurant -presumably so you will come back.  But restaurant week often also means a payday for restaurants that live off their reputation and serve a slightly lower quality, smaller dinner. And it means a busy restaurant. Still, this doesn't absolve Dock's for getting our reservation wrong:  we called the day before and asked for a window table. But Docks could not deilver that, even though we were on time. Docks is known for its fish. And here I have usually found them to perform brilliantly. But on this day, I was disappointed. I deliberately avoided the restaurant week specials, and was willing to pay more: I ordered the special of grilled Mako shark. I was led by the waitress to believe I would get a piece of fish similar to swordfish -a cut rather like a fish 'steak.' I've had Mako before, and that also was what I would usually expect. But what I received was a piece of fish that looked more like a scoop from an ice cream cone -though it was one piee of fish. It was grey looking and did not show a sear orgrill marks. And it tasted rather flavorless. It was clearly an inferior piece of fish. but I could not say anything or have it sent back -it was my birthday, someone else bought, and my family were on a short timeline to make an evening plane.There's a lot more I could say. On the good side, I had a surprisingly good brunch there, except for the fact that the orange juice was not fresh. Also recently, the oysters were excellent. But service and cuisine have been uncertain for too long.",1,0,0,Steve O.,"New York, NY",7,87,4

1.0,1/18/2019,"Please avoid this place - Went with a large party and one of the group found a human tooth crown in her mashed potato whilst eating it!! On confirming it was not her crown we called management whose response was that the crown had not come from any of their kitchen staff and were we sure the tooth was not from one of us!!! We were absolutely sure. Understandably most of the group stopped eating however they still tried to charge us for all food except the one meal despite many not eating and discounted some of the drinks as compensation. We agreed to pay for all drinks and tipped the waiters etc. as it was not their fault however refused to pay the food bill so we paid the remainder and left. The following week the manager called one of the group to apologize and make sure the person was not ill which we thought was a nice gesture, however, 3 days later my colleagues credit card was debited not only for the $400 amount which was the difference of the bill that was presented on the night but also for an additional $300 which they had initially discounted and for which no bill was ever received. The manager took 3 weeks to respond to my colleague and claimed that the initial discount was an offer just on that night and now they had decided to bill the full amount but presented no bill!!! Unbelievable and disgraceful treatment from a reputable restaurant and they have subsequently lost a lot of trade from a number of colleagues in my organization who regularly used the place but will do so no more, not because of the incident but due to the appalling actions of management thereafter.",0,0,0,Luc V.,"Gowanus, Brooklyn, NY",20,1,0

However, I gusss our waitress Paige was never notified about it because even after we ordered desserts there was no candles or anything that came out with the cheesecake that we ordered.

4.0,12/8/2018,"This place has a classy yet casual new orleans feel. Firstly I am BLOWN away at their brunch and happy hour deals. I'm from manhattan and I have found my new favorite place to come for those. Brunch- $30 for entree and bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's! They also serve a basket of complimentary homemade bread and marmalade with blueberry muffins before your course starts. The entrees do not disappoint! They have courses from lobster hash to crab cake Benedict's. I would recommend the crab cake Benedict it was full of crab. While the lobster hash had lots of lobster I found the dish to be somewhat overly buttery. The drinks... the bartender pours heavy in a wonderful way. Just like they do in New Orleans they create a vibe of let the good times roll!! Happy hour- M-F 3-7pm and then 12-7pm on the weekends. Can I repeat that again?? 12-7!!! It includes wine $7, beer $4, well drinks $6. But it gets better with the happy hour food! $1 oyster, $2.5 beef sliders, $6 fish tacos and so much more! Everything tastes amazing and you still get the complimentary bread basket :) All in all, this may look like a tourist place due to its location near grand central and Bryant Park, but as a local I'm obsessed with this place.

3.0,11/23/2018,Went there for thanksgiving dinner. Was not impressed by the portion size. Turkey was dry.  Very little gravy. And when I asked for more it was like I was bothering them. A small scoop of stuffing and a very small scoop of mashed potato. I can't even explain what the vegetables were. Some of the staff was ok. Thus the reason for 3 stars.

No complaint there (unlike some other yelpers experienced. So maybe it's a toss up depending on who you get).  We ordered Bloody Mary's and it was delicious. It wasn't too strong, so if you want your Bloody Mary vodka heavy, maybe it won't be your favorite. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts and prosciutto from the appetizers. I enjoyed the Brussels sprouts. Prosciutto was okay. Nothing crazy fancy. As my main dish I ordered the shrimp Caesar salad. It was good and the shrimps on there w BUT overly priced (hello, Manhattan). It was delicious and I enjoyed it but I don't think I'll give up my $30 again for it. Just my opinion. My friends ordered the fish and chips and Cobb salad. Both were around $30 as well. With all that the total bill was close to $200 (including tip) for lunch for 3.

At least they were well-shucked.Our waiter seemed uninterested in serving us and did not apologize when he spilled liquid (from a pitcher of mimosa) on our table and made a joke about just missing my companion's foot.

Smaller lobsters taste better, pro-tip from this New Englander in my fantasy basketball league whom I know (""Justin S."")

There were a ton of servers just standing in a row with nothing to do so on the bright side we got plenty of attention. People slowly began trickling in after about an hour.For our meal my friend I got the following:1) Caesar Salad: This was an inside joke so we had to get it. Why? Cause we're stupid children. Either way, it's a fine salad. Nicely dressed and very typical. (3.5/5)2) Half Dozen Oysters: Nothing too memorable considering this is an oyster bar. Not fishy but not particularly meaty/sweet/etc either. Served w/ some cocktail sauce & horseradish. Probably more worth it if it was the $1 HH special but not worth the full price. (3.5/5)3) Lobster roll w/ fries & slaw: Standard lobster roll for about $30. Packed with a decent amount of meat. Didn't get to try it since this was my friend's entree. She said it was pretty good and since she wasn't too hungry it was filling enough. Fries were thin/medium cut, semi soggy but with bits of crispiness. Good ketchup. I took a few bites of her slaw which wasn't too flavorful.4) Lobster Hash: My main entree and it was a poor pick on my part. General texture was just mush all around. Lobster was there but not a ton. Flavorwise just rather bland all around.Overall our experience here alright. Nothing particularly special and for the price we hoped for a bit more.

Unlimited mimosas & bloody Marys were served with the brunch package though there's less alcohol in it to be desired.The reason why they didn't get 5 stars is that the service was slow. The servers were not attentive (and perhaps overwhelmed) refilling drinks whether it's coffee, tea or even water. Upon sitting down, no one asked if we wanted any coffee, tea or drinks. We had to ask what they offer. This establishment has been opened for at least 20 years, so I suppose they could care less about offering top notch service.

3.0,4/3/2018,"I attended the Taste of Magic event here and while the show was amazing, fun, and engaging, the service and food at this restaurant was not so much enjoyable. This event had a pre fixe menu so the options were limited to what you saw in my photos.  You cannot make any substations of any kind (even if you are willing to pay extra - I  understand this policy but don't agree with it). What I couldn't understand was number one, the ORIGINAL pre fixe menu was a bit vague (there was one left on our plate for quick reference which was not as detailed as the menu in the table book). While two dishes mentioned sides, the other 2 did not (linguine not included). And number 2, when I asked the waiter about the sides that came with the chicken, he said there weren't any. Highly perplexed, I continued to question the dish and the answers I got had me and my table dying with laughter because of the ignorant response. I said to the waiter ""so this dish is just the chicken alone? It's just the chicken, nothing else?"" His response? ""Well no, I think it comes with a bone in it."" He said this with the most straight face because he was SERIOUS! Seriously DUMB. What am I a dog?! So I continued to press the matter. ""A bone? So no vegetables or mashed potatoes?"" His response again? ""I think it may come with some vegetables."" ...you think....may....Wow....I was just so shocked. So I ultimately ordered the sea bass against my will really. Long story short, I found out the chicken actually did come with a side of mashed potatoes and although they gave me a hard time, I was able to change my order.To make matters worse, out of the eight of us, I think I'm the only one who was really contempt with their meal. I had ordered the chicken while majority ordered the sea bass and two had ordered the steak. My chicken was pretty good, mashed potatoes and all, however I felt the amount of lemon used was a bit overpowering. The others in my party said the sea bass wasn't bad but lacked a bit of flavor. Regarding the steak, my guests had BOTH received their meals and it was cold! But for the sake of time, patience, and hunger, ate it as it was. That was very disappointing.While parking wasn't too much of a headache (there was a lot of street parking right around the corner), I honestly don't know if I'd return here just to try out the restaurant and the menu itself after this experience.

For $26 you can get a bottomless brunch with the choice of mimosas or bloody Mary's, fruit salad, bread/biscuit basket, coffee, juice and a brunch entree. Which is honestly not a bad deal. Plus, they also have a jazz trio playing background music which amps up the ambiance of the place (brownie points)! I've been coming here for a good year and a half, mainly for brunch, but since the last I came which was roughly 6-7 months ago, I feel like the food presentations have increased. I had their Maine Lobster Hash as my entree and it just looked really nice. It was a nice balance and the hash wasn't as hash as it was before which is a good thing. The eggs oozed nicely so if you're a foodgrammer it's worth vid. The only thing with the entree was I thought there'd be more lobster but it played out okay in the end. The mimosas are a little pulpy but on the stronger end. So if you're looking for a swooze day, definitely consider it! I'd honestly will probably be back for brunch again. I did see their happy hour menu and I think it's worth a shot as well.",0,0,0,Hervy O.,"Queens, Queens, NY",361,9,28
3.0,3/6/2018,"A group of 12 of us came here for Saturday brunch. It was pretty surprising that they could accommodate that many of us on such short notice--I think we call to schedule the day before.Everyone had to order the bottomless drinks if anyone wanted to do it. However, in hindsight it was a waste because the mimosas were incredibly watered. I might as well have been drinking just OJ. And our server was not very attentive--a must especially with such a large group.The bottomless option comes with a side of fruit and an entree. I never got my side of fruit by the way, which was odd.My entree was the French toast with strawberries. It was good, though nothing special.The space is visually nice though it feels like a place you could bring your parent for Sunday brunch, which is nice.",0,0,0,Mythili M.,"Manhattan, NY",50,198,1179

2.0,2/14/2018,"I am a regular at Docks and I must honestly say that the real reason I am continuing to go there is for the ambience. I do think this restaurant is beautiful and has a great vibe. Kind of old style and sophisticated. I go there very often, at least once per week, after work for a couple of drinks before heading home.  However, it has a big problem: bartenders are rude. They have an attitude and I think it is cultural of this place. Only here I have observed this kind of attitude. They like to be fast and show it: it seems that they always push you to take your decision quickly, although there is no reason. I understand when the bar is full, but not when nobody is there, like yesterday night. Also, I had the impression they tend to look down on you. Honestly, I am getting very annoyed from their attitude. I would love to make them understand, just because I did spend so much money there. So, I can just limit myself to leave this review, with the suggestion for the manager to solve this issue, as I heard many people complaining of the same problem.",0,0,0,Mario F.,"Manhattan, NY",56,34,9

Conveniently enough, it was Restaurant Week[/Month], so...after doing some menu searching and looking for some place relatively close to my office, we settle on Docks. The vibe is similar to other upscale midtown steakhouses, very nice.The service was generally fine - I thought it was a tad be slow at times, but perhaps they weren't looking to rush us (though, lunches during weekdays/while working are seldom super-leisurely - but can understand the privacy given). The food - we pretty much stuck to the RW menu:Appetizer: Grilled Spanish Octopus with marinated garbanzo salad - lovely; I'm a yuuuuge octopus fan and this preparation with the refreshing yet hearty garbanzo salad was great.Main:Grilled Lamb Chops with caramelized parsnip purée, braised collard greens, au jus - lamb chops...for lunch...what the heck is there not to like??? Awesome.Dessert:Coconut Chocolate Doughnut - freshly made, warm and gooey. Bangin.Granny Smith Apple Cobbler - nice, though the portion was a tad bit small, but with sharing with the donuts, I didn't leave with 'the itus'/a food coma, so good deals.A restaurant week success - so much so, I'd definitely consider coming back to sample the regular menu.",1,0,0,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204

Docks is always packed after work, popular happy hour spot. Seafood is always good, amazing oysters and crab cakes my fav! Brunch on Sunday, bottomless brunch menu is a steal, it includes your food, drinks and coffee. Pros: the brunch food menu, my favorites are lobster hash and crab cake Benedict. Crab cakes are amazing, not too much lobster in the hash but still good. Cons: the alcohol is premade in a pitcher, not made per order, your mimosa will pretty much be watered down orange juice. The food here is always amazing, the reason i gave Docks 3.5 stars is because of the poor service. Servers are not very attentive, they are either too busy elsewhere or too busy turning over tables and forget to attend to their actual customers.

I asked the waiter if they can put a splash of orange but they already had the mimosas pre-made in pitchers (this cringes me). We all ordered from the bottomless section from the menu. I ordered eggs Benedict (fav) and it was good. It came with a side of fruit. Nothing special. For the amount of money you spend at this restaurant - the food is just okay.

We told her we would like to have a drink at the bar first to which she just shook her head. Again, upon seating us.....zero warmth. Our server was even worse. He did not greet us, welcome us or even say hello. He simply asked for our drink order. He had absolutely no personality and literally did not smile once. At one point, he took my drink away and did not even ask if I'd like another. For apps, we had the calamari and seafood empanadas which were decent. The place was pretty much empty yet we felt rushed as they brought our food out as we were still on appetizers. I had the lobster risotto and my husband had the Tuna. All I can about the food is it was mediocre at BEST and very small portions.  We left hungry. I will say the manager was very accommodating (as we were paying with a gift card and had some questions). He was very professional and helpful.

I ordered the crab omelette and I felt like it was crab meat that I would be able to purchase myself from a can or jar. I expect slightly more from a restaurant. BUT we did order oysters and we did a taste of 4 or 5 different ones. It was amazing! Extremely happy with them! I do wish they had a system to show us which ones we are eating instead of just telling us really quick and pointing them out. We have a few different kinds. I want to be able to look them up in the menu and taste the different aspects that are described. Instead, we obviously forgot which was which after the first one and were aimlessly tasting.

Mimosas were 99% orange juice and i had 4 bloodies and didn't even feel buzzed.- Me and 2 other friends ordered the frittata and the eggs were extremely undercooked, i cut into it and it was liquid egg and very bland tasting. i get that ordering an egg dish at a seafood restaurant is not their expertise, but friends who ordered other dishes weren't thrilled with them either.- Kind of felt ignored by the waiter, had to frequently flag him down for drink refills and it wasn't even busy at allPros:- Muffins were delicious and warm... since my main course was so bad i ate 6 of those bad boys and thankfully did not leave hungry, but still less than ideal to fill up on an appetizer.- Fresh fruit salad and unlimited coffee was good and a nice perk to be included with a $25 brunch- my water was refilled alot which was nice, but not by the waiter.Overall, you get what you pay for.

They happy hour calamari with buffalo sauce is a bit weird. Had dinner here one time and got their seared ahi tuna and grilled sea bass - probably the worst dishes I've ever had in my life. First the tuna didn't taste fresh and the outer layer could have been seared better, second that dish lacks flavors. Then here comes the grilled sea bass, which was a bit over grilled that you can taste a little bit of burntness in every bite of the fish. The asparagus that came with the sea bass would probably taste better (more of a texture problem, it got cut up into small pieces and got overlooked) if not chopped up.Service was alright, food came really fast, I wish the waiter could've told us the specials of the day rather than me finding out from the board when I was on my way to the bathroom.No doubt this is a great place for business meals if you don't want to go too far from Grand Central , not spend too much, and want seafood.",1,0,0,ChingWa C.,"Manhattan, NY",147,183,309

First off, we waited a while for our check to come before realizing our server left without giving it to us. I was wrongly charged $71 without being told (I saw it on my bank account before leaving) and then they brought me another check for the right amount of $51 but I was still charged $71 so this restaurant charged me $120. I brought it to the hostess's attention and when the manager came to address the mistake she was incredibly rude and unhelpful. Because they had overcharged me so much I only had $30 left in my bank account. I told the manager how unsafe it was to be in the city and to be tight on money like that.

It was a Friday so it was really packed. The Hammersley oysters from WA were some of the best I've ever tasted and they were remarkably fresh. I also enjoyed the spicy, crunchy tuna roll. The Sauvignon Blanc being poured for happy hour was mediocre at best but I was surprised at how good the French rose was. Major kudos to those making the buying choices for the food & wine. Where it fell off was the service. I get that the place was slammed. And I rolled with that without complaint. But what really irked me was that once the happy hour ended the staff behind the bar checked our mentally. Perhaps they should have taken turns taking a break or something at the end if they were that wiped out - which is understandable. But what was not understandable was that they completely ignored people once the rush was over. It took me 10 minutes to get my bartender's attention and ask for the check. But the real issue was that he never brought it. 20 additional minutes after that I could NOT get any of the staff to acknowledge my presence and bring me the check. Maybe this is why they have to be sure to hold credit cards for a tab - since they aren't good at collecting the money at the end they have to make you the one to ensure it happens. What really was the final straw for me though was the fact that my bartender clocked out of work without bringing me my tab and then hung at at the bar, pointedly ignoring me trying to get his attention from 15 feet away. The attitude was definitely, ""I'm not on the clock and therefore you do not exist."" He was even hanging out with the people in the group next to me. One of them tried to get his attention for me but he ignored her too. After being held hostage there for a total of 30 minutes (This is by Grand Central, BTW. People have trains to catch) I finally got up and walked over to where a group of servers were socializing behind the bar and got one of them to investigate what occurred with my bill AND credit card that I had handed up for the tab. Turns out that my suddenly blind bartender had placed my credit card in front of the group of his friends next to me and walked away. Yep. Gave my card to other people. So it was right in front of him while he was socializing after his shift. An easy fix he he simple hadn't ignored me. I get that when you are done with work you are off the clock. But if you are going to be a jerk about it then go socialize in a different bar after your shift. And the general disappearance of all other staff at the end of happy hour didn't help.I am guessing that they pool their tips at the end of the night. So blind bartender had no incentive to wrap up outstanding tabs and collect the tips from the shift. It had been my intention to double my usual tip as a thank you for charging my cell phone behind the bar, but of course I couldn't get my phone back either. As a result the tip got cut in half. I really resented being forced to stay somewhere when I wanted to leave and being treated like an un-valued person. That being said, I still think that the food and drink at Docks are great. The hostess was really nice. The room was pleasant. And my bill was super reasonable. For that reason, I'll probably give it another chance some day. But maybe from a dining table. Perhaps the wait-staff is better trained than the bar staff. My big take-away is...go and enjoy the apps at happy hour. But pay cash as you go and do not get your phone charged at the bar. This way you are not held against your will due to the inattentiveness of the tired bartenders. You can just get up and leave when you are ready.",2,0,0,Kim R.,"New York, NY",319,117,56
3.0,7/26/2017,"Restaurant week review:Booked a table for 6:45pm today and got there around 6:20pm, but we were seated immediately towards the back. We were greeted by our waitress Carly who was pretty nice and during our meal, kept asking if we need anything/if everything was alright. We ordered a wine and beer after we were seated and bread with butter were brought out to us. Some of the bread were pretty burnt, but it wasn't bad.The food was alright but wasn't anything special. For appetizers, my boyfriend ordered the chorizo stuffed baked clams and I got the shrimp & crab ceviche cocktail. The clams were pretty good with a nice kick at the end. The ceviche was a little on the sweet side, but it was alright and the shrimp tasted fresh. We also ordered the New England clam chowder on the side because we wanted to try it, but we were kind of disappointed. It lacked flavor and was watered down. I was looking for a bit thicker consistency. For the entrees, my boyfriend got the surf and turf and I got the rigatoni w/ spicy sausage ragout. His steak was pretty good but the mashed potato that came with it tasted powdery. The rigatoni was good, but they gave a whole scoop of ricotta cheese, which I thought was too much.  For dessert, we both got the coconut creme brûlée. It had a lot of coconut flakes in it and I think the creme brûlée was baked too long because it didn't have a smooth consistency. Despite the food being just alright, the atmosphere was very lively and the restaurant has a pretty nice interior.",0,0,0,Vivian N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,4

4.0,7/13/2017,"Nothing wrong with this place ... the food won't wow you ... but that's not why you are here. The menu is kind of blah. Not too imaginative ... not surprising for a corporate seafood restaurant, but it sure wasn't McCormick & Schmidts! However, this is a great place for doing business ... and lets be honest, when you are talking about business or negotiating a deal, the food is secondary. Half the time I don't even taste what I am eating at a business lunch.If you are here for a family dinner or pleasure meal, maybe the secret is to come for brunch, which the company who owns this restaurant is known for. (Sarabeth's another of the company's restaurants is legendary for brunch). I don't think anyone who walks in for a lunch or dinner would be wow'ed by the food.The atmosphere is why I come back. It's a great restaurant for doing business ... the tables are nice and spread out, so you cannot overhead what is going on at the tables next to you. This is important. Nothing worse than trying to negotiate a business deal while hearing every word at the next table. The setup of the restaurant is almost done with this in mind. There is also a huge round bar in the center which you can eat.The staff here 'get it' as well. They don't stop by every few minutes to interrupt you to ask how your food is or push drinks on you. If they see you talking, they stay at arm's length ... close enough to see you, if you need to catch their eye. Far enough where you don't feel that they are hooving over you waiting to spring a dessert menu on you. I loved this about our waitress ... she took our order, put it down, let us talk and stood nearby.It has a very nautical vibe to it ... dark wood, brass, glass windows looking out onto the street. Kind of like the seafood version of Capitol Grill. Prices ... are what they are in NYC ... $30 salads, $12 bowls of soup, $20 cheeseburger, $12 draft beers. It is what it is.All in all, if you need to take a client out or find somewhere to hammer out the details of a business deal ... this is your spot. If you are going out for a nice family dinner, a date or in search of a memorable seafood meal, this might not be your place. There's nothing wrong with the food here ... but it won't impress.

4.0,5/11/2017,"This review is for brunch and brunch alone.  Definitely was a little intimidating walking into Docks on a Sunday around 12:45pm because the clientele looked a bit older than the normal murray hill crowd (think retirees).  I almost walked right back out... but thankfully I didn't listen to my fears.  Once we got seated, I took in the beauty of the restaurant and was absolutely thrilled to see the 3 piece jazz band that was playing jazzy covers of pop songs! Also, I'm not sure why this place isn't poppin because they offer a $26 bottomless brunch which includes a brunch item and coffee, tea, bloody marys and mimosas.  26! that's a steal. It also includes a bread basket and some delicious (homemade? maybe) butter and jam.  Gotta knock 1 star off because I really wanted the chicken and waffles (with is a Brunch entrée and thus, not included in the $26) and would have needed to pay per drink -- why isn't there a choice of a ++ upcharge for drinks for the entrees offered instead of the $12 per drink? Just doesn't seem fair especially since many of the brunch items and the brunch entrees are the same price.  Also, it seemed the staff weren't as apt to refill our beverages after the 4th round.   *I ended up ordering the lobster hash which was hearty, but a tiny bit too salty for my liking.

The waitstaff refilled our glasses before they were ever empty -- even after the two-hour time limit ended. In the background, a live jazz trio played classics and hits.

My table came here with intentions to spend money and celebrate 2 birthdays with no restrictions. At no point was anyone looking for anything FREE. The way that Sean handled the situation was very unprofessional and his behavior was that I would expect from a lower end restaurant.

For such a classy establishment, I hadn't had high expectations for the reasonably priced roll, but it really hit the spot. The bar service was where I'm deducting stars-- overall the bar service was inconsistent, generally inattentive, and seemingly confused. The speed of your order and quality of service seemed to directly correlate with which bartender you happen to have ordered from; people who had ordered much earlier than others would be stuck waiting for their drinks (+15/20 minutes) while some got their drinks immediately (2 minutes).

I got the seafood risotto which was great. It's hard to cook risotto and it was cooked just right. I gobbled it all up. And for the dessert, I had cookies (not a fan of chocolate, so channeled my inner younger palette for their cookies platter), which...surprisingly were good.

I showed them that the website did not specify that that dish had to be charged USD 5 extra but still they did not care.I think it is very dishonest to cheat clients by showing something on their website and then going there and charging something else.

Apparently the bloody marys are on the spicier side and their mimosas are tasty.The service threw me off the most. The waitress and server didn't know the menu that well. We asked a couple of questions about some of the items and got either a dismissive ""I don't know"" or they kindly went to ask the kitchen. I am lactose intolerant and thought I was safe by ordering the Lobster Hash, since on the menu did not include any dairy items. I asked the waitress to double check and she agreed there was no dairy in it. When the dish came, it had a buttery, creamy benedict sauce on top and I had to send it back and wait another 20min for my dish to arrive. The waitress kindly apologized and said she didn't remember that it came with the sauce.

We stood at the bar for a good 45 minutes while parties saved seats for friends who turned up had one drink and then left or never showed up. Considering how popular and busy it is after work a policy should be implemented because if a seat is available and I'm spending money, I should be able to sit in it. All in all, Docks is good.

Second, there was nothing special about what we got. Nothing blew me away. Our fish didn't come with anything, like fries or side salad. Even our ice cream and sorbet were things we could have gotten exactly at Haagen-Dazs. Third, the atmosphere is so uppity and ritzy. I don't think that I'd be comfortable here outside of RW. I am pretty sure we were the youngest people in the whole place; everyone else was in their 40s and up. So I'd say if you're going for RW, go to another spot. You'll get more for your money and I'm sure you can find a better ambiance, too.",6,3,4,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393

2.0,1/17/2016,"I knew reading the earlier reviews of Dock's that it wasn't necessarily going to be the best culinary experience, but we were in from out of town and it was near our hotel, and for $26 I figured how off could brunch with essentially bottomless Bloody Mary's possibly be? Well, the answer was extremely. We had 11:30 reservations, which was when the restaurant opened, we arrived about 5 minutes early and literally had to wait outside in the cold because they left their doors locked until the moment they opened. The three piece band was setting up as we were finally allowed in, and I have to say they were pretty good - one of the reasons I'm giving 2 stars rather than one. My fiancé and I ordered our brunch, crab cake Benedict for him, asparagus/mushroom/goat cheese omelet for me. The waiter happily accommodated my request for a side of tossed greens rather than potatoes. Our water, coffee, Bloody Mary's, and muffins all arrived promptly. This was when things turned downhill. The house made Bloody Mary mix was loaded with horseradish, like the bartender must have dumped the whole jar in - and we both like things spicy. I couldn't finish mine, the waitress offered to bring another ""watered down"" with tomato juice, which I wasn't thrilled by, but still accepted - it was equally terrible. My fiancé's crab cakes were deep fried - not something you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in seafood, and my omelet was pretty lacking in asparagus, mushrooms, and goat cheese. I did speak with a manager, who was very accommodating and took my food away and my meal off the bill. My fiancé choked down the remainder of his watered down Bloody Mary and enjoyed his potatoes. Can't say I would recommend this one to anyone. Would've rather paid for individual drinks and enjoyed both the drinks and the food. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for brunch.",0,0,0,Candice P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,7,0

3.0,1/6/2016,"Totally a fan of this place. I agree with a few of the other reviewers--the lobster hash is amazing. Try it. It comes with two poached eggs that are perfectly runny and will drizzle your seafood and potatoes with ooey gooey yolk. Not sure if this is a good or bad thing (probably depends) but they are laid back and family friendly. At least, for lunch/brunch. There was a giant party of over 10 people next to us and they had a great time. Maybe too great? But the staff was totally cool about letting the kids feel at home.The other things you get are great--Bloody Mary's are good here. Didn't try the mimosa, but the $25 prix fixe gets you unlimited non-alcoholic drinks, and 1 free cocktail (mimosa or bloody), with each additional cocktail costing $1. Not a bad deal for somewhere that's not quite boozy brunch paradise, since it is classier than some boozy brunch places. Understandable. Our waitress was very nice, a little quirky. She was fun, and warned us not to mix our cocktails up too much, please. I assume that comes from some personal experience with the unfortunate result of mixing mimosas and bloody's. The restaurant is very large, so it felt very calm, and noise dissipated fairly quickly. There was a live band playing some classic coffee shop tunes/breakfast jazz, and that added a nice touch. Everything was satisfactory overall. I would come again to try the other bowls.",2,0,0,CHRISTINE Z.,"New York, NY",73,289,35

3.0,12/22/2015,"Good happy hour menu, but the service can be a bit slow during the height of happy hour and the food quality is lacking.I came here for happy hour with a few friends at around 5:45pm on a Monday and the place was bustling. We were able to get a few spots in the corner where the bar stools and counters were since every seat at the oval bar was already taken. The restaurant was very nice, classy and there was a mix of tourists and suit & tie business folks here. The happy hour was from 3-7pm so we got cracking immediately and grabbed a menu off of the bar to order.The happy hour menu was pretty deep with a good selection of beers (Hoegaarden, Stella, etc.) and wines. For the food, there were $1 oysters, $1 clams, burger sliders, a tuna sushi roll and calamari. It was a bit of a challenge to order because every seat at the bar was occupied so trying to catch the attention of the waitresses/bartenders over the customers at the bar were not easy. I had to squeeze in between people while they were eating, drinking and chatting at the bar. It was not the best system of taking orders. We felt they should've had some waitress on the outside of the bar area taking orders at least.After putting in our order, the drinks came immediately, but the food took a long time to come out. We ordered 2 dozen oysters first, which took about 20 minutes to arrive. Then we ordered 6 burger sliders and calamari, which came a bit faster. However, our tuna sushi roll was completely forgotten and I had to give them a reminder about it after 20+ minutes of waiting. After they put in the tuna sushi roll order, we waited another 15-20 minutes for it. The service was definitely disappointing because it was slow and lacking. To their defense they seemed very busy running around, but it's still no excuse for forgetting an item of an order at such an established restaurant.Besides the service, the happy hour food was not satisfying either:Oysters - They were not cut well and shards of shell were inside the oyster. It was a bit bothersome that every time we ate an oyster we had to spit back out pieces of the shell. Calamari - It was just too chewy for our liking. It was like chewing a rubberband.Burger Sliders - Probably the best of the items we ordered. The burgers were cooked medium rare and were actually pretty good.Tuna Sushi Roll - It was ok. The pieces were small, but at least they gave 8. There were not many complaints here.I'm not sure what the lunch and dinner experience is like, but the happy hour here has a lot of room for improvement. The hospitality was good and friendly, but the service was too slow despite the foot traffic. Also, the happy hour food quality needs to be improved if they are to elevate themselves to the likes of happy hour hotspots like Lure Fishbar or Mermaid Oyster Bar.",1,0,0,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624

Happy hour ends at 7pm here, and we came on a thursday evening around 6:45. We tried to get the attention of one of four bartenders working, for thirteen minutes. At around 6:58, I finally got the attention of one, who was very terse and slightly abrasive. I told him we had wanted to do something for happy hour to which he interrupted me and said, its too late for that I can't put in the order for you.After asking if he could put our orders in with two minutes left, -- since we had waited 15 minutes to even get to ask him -- he said no and that the systems were shut down already.I was already slightly skeptical about coming here because a friend had told us not to waste our time at this restaurant, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway...

I went there wearing jeans and my boyfriend was wearing cargo pants -- we felt a little out of place, but they served us regardless! We even got a window seat so we can watch city folk pass by. The atmosphere is classy, the service is very kind and attentive, and it's all around a nice place to sit and enjoy some quality time with a loved one. My boyfriend and I ordered as much food as possible. For appetizers, we got calamari and a spicy tuna roll. This was easily one of the best dishes of calamari I've ever had. The sushi was also good -- not quiet Japanese restaurant quality, but certainly tasty! For my meal, I got a juicy lobster roll. The buttery roll was jam-packed with delicious lobster meat and every bite was fantastic. Again, the menu is pricey, but the quality of the food is excellent and worth paying for over and over again.

2.0,7/1/2015,"This place did not impress me. The prices were not worth the portion sizes, and the service was awkward. I came here after a convention this week for dinner and it just didn't do it for me. I wanted a nice seafood salad, and there are a few on the menu. My coworker ordered the seafood Cobb and I ordered the shrimp and crab seafood salad. Both were sort of disappointments, especially after having asked our server a few questions about them, just to be sure which to order. The Cobb looked just okay, but when you spend $30 on a salad, you would expect more than what was presented. The shrimp salad was described as 'ceviche,' but was not ceviche at all. The calamari rings tasted like the salmon, and the salmon tasted Iike the scallops. I needed salt just to eat it and couldn't even finish the small portion. Oh- it was poached too, NOT like ceviche at all! It was bland and I was really surprised. I would expect more from NYC, but oh well. My other coworker had the risotto and he liked it, so at least they got that right.  Overall, it was just a bit pricey for what was presented, and it seemed like it was the servers first day. She did have a section in the back, so I guess I am not that surprised. I would recommend going elsewhere for sushi, perhaps the Oyster bar at Grand Central Terminal--which is awesome!",1,0,1,Jess H.,"Chicago, IL",11,47,8

But it still doesn't make up for the lunch I had here a few weeks back...Our server, Brooke, must've thought we were stupid or something and that we didn't understand Spanish. Wrong, I speak fluent Spanish and understand it like my mother tongue. I overheard her talking to the busboys about her ""pussy"" and how wet it was because she was on her period. I saw two of the busboys tense up when they heard this and one walked away in disgust. To hear this in a restaurant is despicable. The way she just stood there talking about her private parts to these guys really disgusted me. I wonder what else she says to the employees when she thinks nobody can understand her.I urge you, Docks Managers, to discipline this woman.

1.0,2/22/2015,"I'll start with some complaints about the service. Though the words ""oyster bar"" appear in the name of this establishment, my oysters were brought to me without any explanation. When I asked which ones were which, the server gestured vaguely and said ""these are west coast, and these are east coast,"" not bothering to differentiate among them. (I would understand this rushed treatment at a crowded  $1 oyster happy hour, but these things were not cheap and we were one of four parties in the restaurant.) Furthermore, after a brief discussion about my father's order, the server still got it wrong, and seemed confused when we pointed it out. Never, ever order fish and chips here. If you are served it by mistake (see above), accept ANY offer to substitute with ANYTHING else. For those of you familiar with clam cakes, imagine a very large, clamless clam cake with a poor abused fish hiding somewhere inside. For everyone else, imagine a big fried pillow of dough, with a poor abused fish hiding inside. At 1""-3"" thick on all sides of the fish, the dough pillow was a challenge. The undercooked parts of the batter coated the fish (which admittedly was fresh-tasting) even after one attempted to remove the pillow that suffocated it.My family was desperate to find a seafood place because I was visiting from a region of the world sadly lacking in seafood, and the oyster bar in grand central was closed.

I arrived at 5:30pm (their HH runs until 7pm) and managed to get a seat at the rather busy bar. I ordered a glass of house Sauvignon Blanc ($7) and waited for my friend to arrive. He showed up about 15 mins after and had a whiskey on the rocks. We ordered one dozen of the HH special oysters (that day it was bluepoints) for $1/each - a great deal! By 6:10, we decided to order a second drink and I asked the bartender (who was very pleasant) if he had any idea how much longer our oysters would take...we had to leave by 6:30pm sharp. He said he couldn't know for sure because HH is so busy and there is apparently only one oyster shucker in the kitchen so it is first order - first serve. We had our drinks refilled and anxiously awaited our oysters. By 6:25 they still had not arrived! This is 40 mins from the time we ordered them. I was shocked and then disappointed because I realized we just had to close our tab and leave. We did that, and the bartender completely understood and was apologetic (he actually comped us our second round) but still....not good. I can understand the busy nature of HH - especially at a place known for oysters. So, either have more than one person working during the busy HH time - or warn your patrons that even if you order oysters, you may need to wait at least 45 mins (who knows how long) for them to arrive. I hope that my experience was a one-off event and that other people fare better - be it during HH or at regular times. The place is known for their seafood - both raw and cooked - and I can't imagine if my experience were a consistent one that they would still do such robust business.",1,0,1,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592

I always order sparkling water and this time it was served it in a refillable bottle. Not a problem - except it was tap water run through a soda stream ! I'm not even kidding - the waitress did not refute it either. Tacky move for $4 a bottle. Appetizers were extremely bland and entrees were mediocre.

They treated me as a second class citizen and suggested I eat at the bar.When I was at the bar the Mexican gentlemen opening the claims also tells me just eat at the bar.   My reservation was 8:45Pm and was seated at 9:25 after complaining to the manger. I told the manager I was ready to run back to The Old Homestead and he said go, rudest manager I have every spoke to.Had the worst server in my life, I think her name was Kelly, about 24 years old  Waited a long time for wineWarm bread had no butterCame back with butter after the bread was coldHad to get another warm rollNever came back with second glass of wineAppetizer clams casino was undercooked.A person seating near my table was complaining about his steak saying it had no taste. At the point I had enough and was not going to wait for my tasteless steak.  I gave the server $20 for my wine and under cooked appetizer, when I told her she was the worst server that I have had in over 50 years she started to yell at me. The older experienced servers have the larger tables.20 minutes later I was at another restaurant and my phone rang, When I answered  it was Docks telling me my food was on the table, I asked them if this was a joke.

2.0,9/17/2014,"Had lunch at Docks yesterday and left substantially poorer and rather displeased. Here's why:Service: Friendly enough but we could never find our server. Food also took forever to arrive, which was a bit of a problem seeing as it was a weekday lunch. Food: Overall fairly average.-- Wild King Salmon: For $34 I expected a whole lot more than a dry piece of salmon over old Basmati rice, with a tiny pile of greens. I don't know what vegetable the greens represented but they were gritty and crunchy, and not in a good way. Couldn't find our waiter but the manager came over and offered to switch the greens out for broccoli, which was nice of him, but unfortunately the broccoli was not cooked and was inedible as well.-- Crab Cake: Quite tasty but didn't care for the accompanying slaw which was drenched in mayo.-- Lobster Bisque: I didn't try this but my husband enjoyed it.-- Baked Potato: Very tasty...but even I can make a baked potato and my culinary skills are quite lacking.-- Bread Basket: The bread itself was just okay but there was a long flatbread / cracker that I couldn't stop eating. So, so good.Prices: So this is where I think Docks' main problem lies...this place is unbelievably overpriced for no apparent reason. I can get a better, organic salmon at Hendriks a few blocks away for $18. Bottom Line: Service is not great, food is not great, ambiance is nice but nothing great.

Ended up leaving and canceling our oysters. As we were leaving the restaurant manager was nice enough to give us the oysters for free and they were coming out right away. We decided to stay and finally taste the oysters. However, they just threw oysters on a plate and gave it to us, it was not shucked property as they were still on the shell and didn't clean them at all as they were still fishy! I'm sorry but if you're trying to make amends for bad service (which I did appreciate)  at least do it right.

Staff: Having gotten seated the waitress did not say what the specials for the day were nor could she describe them. She also seems bewildered at my question of what the difference between the oysters were. After about five minutes of rambling onwards on literally nothing, she realized she was not answering the question I ask... which was simply what kind of oysters the restaurant had. So all in all I must say that I would have rather sat at the bar, since at least I would not have to deal with a waitress.As for the cooked food, I cannot tell if it is a blessing or curse the portion sizes were so small. The food was cooked so poorly that was I happy I would not have to eat much.

He didn't present the specials, I had to ask him about them, and anytime I needed something (i.e. pepper/Tabasco), I had to wave down the busboy even though a group of staff was congregating right by me.Food: Broiled Boston scrod-bland, no taste. NE clam chowder was decent, again, not too much flavor. The lunch special beer was served in an 8oz mug... Might as well been a shot glass. And no, it wasn't a specialty beer. It may or may not have been an off-day for them, but I doubt I'll be back to give them a second try.

4.0,4/20/2014,"Dock's falls under the category of odd places that I've worked near for over six years - but never gone to.  It's not because it's new or because I'm never near it.  My gym is on the same block, but unfortunately every attempt I've made at checking out their happy hour was met with apologetic comments like ""I'm sorry, it may be a half hour or more."" from the hostess.  As I would look around the gigantic bar in the center of the restaurant, the classic New York City art deco decor and the absurdly large amount of people in business wear laughing it up, I always felt a bit dejected (and underdressed in my business casual garb) as I exited.Recently I decided to take some initiative and get there a bit early (shortly after 5pm).  It was already jam packed (Happy Hour begins much earlier you see) but fellow Yelper Leslie D. and I were able to snag one seat.  After some patient stalking, we acquired a second about ten minutes later.  Now stationed, we set out on our Happy Hour mission - $1 oysters and clams!I always said to friends that if I ever had the chance to go to Dock's, I'd drop a $20 and say ""Gimmie dem oystahs!"".  Well, I didn't say ""Gimmie dem oystahs!"" but I did drop a $20 and a few more bucks for a spicy tuna roll and a plate of fried, sweet chili sauce calamari.  This, my friends, is the trifecta of seafood Happy Hour goodness.  The oysters were big, fresh and delicious, served with cocktail sauce, horseradish and slices of lemon.  The spicy tuna roll was tasty and had some nice black sesame seeds on it that gave it an extra element you don't always see in this kind of roll.  The calamari was, for lack of a better term, *addicting*.  Later, when my girlfriend arrived, we ordered clams and those too were meaty and delicious.  On the Happy Hour dishes alone I practically rolled out of the restaurant when we were done.Service was as good as you can expect during a Happy Hour. They have a bartender managing each side of the bar, but with such high demand for their attention they can easily disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time.  This works out however if you want to chit chat and catch up while enjoying your food at a leisurely pace.The best compliment I think you can pay a restaurant is thinking about going back even as you're rolling out of there with a full belly, and Dock's definitely qualifies.",5,2,3,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917

It took the bartender a few minutes to acknowledge me while b. went to use the restroom. When he did, he only informed me that Happy Hour wouldn't start for another ten minutes so I couldn't order anything until then. Website and bar menu clearly stated that Happy Hour starts at 3 PM. Fine, whatever. But no offer of water or even to ask whether I wanted to order a drink. What if I had wanted to order something off of the regular menu?The real kicker was when I came back from the restroom later to find b. sitting at the bar, still with no water or anything. Apparently while I was gone, b. had been reading the bar menu when the bartender came over and grabbed it right out of b.'s hands, stating that b. could not order from it since Happy Hour hadn't started yet. So we sat for a few more minutes, with no water and not even allowed to look at the bar menu, while another woman at the bar around the corner from us sat happily with her glass of water and Happy Hour wine. Really? Was it because we weren't dressed in high power suits or something?Anyways, the $1 Blue Point oysters from CT were good, fairly large, but could have been cleaned better. We enjoyed our Happy Hour Pinot Grigio and Cabernet Sauvignon. But service? Terrible. After serving us our waters and wines, the bartender pretty much ignored us after that.

The oysters are so fresh and the sushi was delicious and came to $5.44 for a generous serving of a spicy tuna roll.The clientele was older and not really the after work crowd I'm accustomed to.......but I can definitely party with Grams for a few hours with these great prices and tasty oysters.",1,1,0,Lauren R.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,120,5

1.0,11/7/2012,"I ate here yesterday for lunch and was surprised by the substandard quality of the food.  I ordered one of the daily specials:  Nantucket scallops with broccoli rabe and Yukon mashed potatoes (but I requested the potatoes to be substituted with the sweet corn flan).To begin, the Nantucket scallops were way overcooked.  They were dry and it was like chewing on rubber.  You would think that a ""better-than-casual"" seafood restaurant is capable of cooking an item from their daily special menu to perfection, but not this place.  Who knows, perhaps the scallops were from frozen and not fresh?  I've definitely had better at Red Lobster.Secondly, the broccoli rabe was literally nasty.  I wish I had a better word to use, because I really hate to use that word, however, there just is no better word to describe the taste.  It was extremely bitter, to the point of being inedible.  I am just shocked how a ""better-than-casual"" restaurant could possibly serve something this disgusting.Finally, the sweet corn flan was extremely bland.  I saw some bits of corn, but couldn't taste it.  No corn flavor whatsoever.  I assume the corn must've come from a can.  Having said that, I've had some pretty tasty canned corn at home, so I have no idea how Dock's Oyster Bar managed to screw that up.The service here perfectly complimented my food.  While the staff was nice, they were not attentive.  No one checked on my table to see how everything was after the food came out.  It was only when it was time to pay that I was able to alert the staff to my disappointment.  A manager did come to the table to rectify the situation for me...  Noticing that 95% of my meal was untouched, she offered something else, but I politely declined as I needed to get back to work.  I did mention to her that I wanted to say something sooner, but I couldn't get anyone's attention and no one stopped by the table to ask how everything was after the food was delivered.Overall, a very disappointing experience.  The food was offensive.  I won't return and do not recommend.  They need to hire quality control to check on the food, and they need to bring their service up a notch.  But the decor is nice.",9,3,3,Jaszon S.,"Westchester County, NY",948,224,182

The last time I went, I had oysters- and every single piece was so horribly shucked, I couldn't enjoy it because I was worried about accidentally hurting myself with shell pieces. The crab sandwich was good, but nothing amazing. Fries were a little undercooked. For the area, it has a solid menu in terms of seafood selection.

5.0,9/18/2012,"Dinner here is pretty solid but way overpriced. The happy hour, however, is too good to pass up! Half-priced drinks and $1 oysters and clams every weekday 3 - 7pm at the huge bar with friendly bartenders and a very mixed mellow crowd. Everything was very fresh and yummy but the oysters varied a lot in size from normal to teeny and a lot of them were not properly shucked. I hate having to inspect oysters before devouring them or, worse, having to pick shell out of my mouth. But I suppose at the rate that these were flying out to feed the hungry crowd, it's understandable that the shuckers had to work fairly quickly. They also have a sushi chef at the bar rolling delicious spicy tuna rolls. I don't recommend the buffalo calamari - it was completely ruined by the buffalo sauce. Plain old calamari would have hit the spot, though. Overall an awesome after-work experience time after time. I will definitely return!",1,0,1,Vera M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",84,5,0

We were so hungry we ate them but saved a couple to show them. Then my oysters arrived but without the vinegar on the tray. I ate most of them without until someone finally walked by and I asked for it. They returned with A FULL BOTTLE of vinegar and just handed it to me. My jaw landed on the table as I honestly had nothing to say. Shocked does not come close. The scallop special was great but it was literally four of them and some couscous.

3.0,4/10/2012,"It was a Friday night and we were craving seafood, but didn't want to venture too far. Docks fit the bill as it generally puts out decent, if slightly expensive, seafood dishes. The atmosphere is nice with very high ceilings, dark wood and crisp white tablecloths. We didn't get any appetizers to start, but Docks has a great bread basket. Particularly nice are the crispy, thin crackers. There is one with dill that is really delicious. For my entree, I got the pacific yellowfin tuna meal, it has an Asian type theme and was good. The fish itself was perhaps a bit overcooked, tuna has a tendency to get a little dry and this piece was particularly dry around the outside. I think if they used a thinner piece, it wouldn't have been so bad as the center (cooked medium) was quite nice. The best part was actually the snow pea slaw, it tasted fresh and added a nice crunch to the dish. The meal also came with two crispy seafood dumplings. I wasn't a fan, I thought they tasted very fishy and didn't really add much to the dish in terms of taste or texture. Overall though,mother food was pretty good and deserving of a three and a half star, maybe even four star rating (on a good night), but service was definitely subpar. I think we saw our server a total of three times through the entire dinner service and I know some of the surrounding tables needed to ask the busboy to go find her when they were ready to pay.

4.0,3/16/2012,"Disclaimer: This review will be purely about Dock's Happy Hour from 3-7pm, because that is the only Dock's experience I can afford.This restaurant has an incredible seafood happy hour at the bar. Half price draught beer, $1 Oysters, $0.50 clams, $2 sliders... did I mention $1 OYSTERS??!The oysters were amazing - fresh, plump, heaven on a half-shell. The sliders were somewhat average, but they were only $2 so it was still a great deal. The clams, cherrystone and littleneck, were okay, but a little on the fishy side. That is to say, they didn't taste quite as fresh as the oysters.The one real drawback is that the happy hour is cheap, but can get expensive real quick. In 45 minutes, we beasted through 30 oysters, 3 clams, 2 sliders, and drinks. Hoo boy, but was it worth it. :)",1,0,2,Clover Y.,"Manhattan, NY",4,4,0

It is very close to GCT and the style of the interior looked much classier. It had a classy slightly mod-feel. The oysters were delicious and they had a good variety. The cooked food was also good.

From the beginning of the waiter looking less than interested in our group of 11 with an Asian host at our table trying to coordinate everything, to the less than ideal recommendation of the most expensive thing on the menu to the actual food being sub par at best, Dock's will not see my business again. The oysters were too chewy and the swordfish was dry as leather. The desert was the best part and that was just chocolate pudding.

5.0,1/27/2012,"Absolutely one of the BEST HAPPY HOUR restaurants I have been to in a very long time!!Located only 3 blocks away from Grand Central Station, this restaurant is nothing but incredible. Great choices, beautifully decorated and super spacious and very pleasing to the eye.For example, most restaurants tend to be dimly lit so you can't really see how fresh or flawed your food is. But here at Docks, they hold no reservations and their restaurant is well lit which only made my mouth water even more when my 2 1/2 dozen raw oysters and clams arrived! They were extraordinarily fresh, the liqueur tasted like the sea, the meat was extremely plump and best of all, they were affordable.On the downside, you must be at the bar area in order to take advantage of their happy hour special (3-7pm). However, by the time we got there (5:30pm) the place was super packed and finding a seat was impossible. We ended up having to wait a while and luckily found a seat before 7pm only because we were on the look out.The staff was friendly and our multi-talented bartender who also acted as our waiter was swift and professional. I also highly recommend that you try their tuna spring roll ($3). It was simple, yet amazing. The tuna inside was still raw (exactly how I like it) while the shell was crispy and their sesame based oil dipping sauce was certainly interesting. I haven't had dinner here as of yet, but since my experience went so well during happy hour, I certainly plan on coming here to continue my odyssey with what Poseidon and his creation has to offer!!

1.0,1/15/2012,"Have been here exactly twice before, but I had such an oddly poor brunch experience just now I had to comment. I actually live right around the block on 39th st, and thought it'd be a good idea to stop in here for brunch as I had little else to do during the day. That was a mistake. Firstly, I came around 11:15 am and discovered the place opens at 11:30 am. No biggie, I just waited outside with four other people. I go out to eat a lot and typically, if the place opens at a certain time they just let people in around ten minutes before and simply serve them water until the kitchen opens. Um...not here. Kept waiting outside in the cold til 11:30 on the dot.Whatever. I assume my place at the bar. When I've been served brunch here before at the bar, I was served by a cheery pretty female bartender. Instead there was a husky African-American guy (just for sake of description, I'm AA as well). He asked me if I was waiting for someone. Thought nothing of it, but I informed him no. I go out to eat and drink a lot as a female alone, as it's usually not a big deal in NYC. In 2012.I order the bottomless brunch special, which is a deal for around 25 bucks, and have a mimosa. Mimosas are watered down, as previous reviews have stated, but whatever, that's not a huge biggie with me. Bartender is keeping an eye on me, which I find very strange and makes me uncomfortable. I get the goat cheese and spinach frittata. The brunch comes with a bread and muffin basket, but I had to remind the bartender of it and he hands it to me. Cold.Frittata arrives and it and its accompaniment (3 pepper potato hash) is underseasoned, as many brunch dishes, but no biggie, I asked for salt and liberally apply. Bartender keeps me on the corner of his eye. I try to make small talk with him, because there may be a ton of reasons why someone is eyeing you, so I attempt to put him at ease. Don't think it worked.I'm on my 2nd mimosa, put down my Blackberry for a second and stare into the warm sun peeking into the window. Bartender nears in rapidly, ""Are you ok?"" in an odd tone. I'm like, ""Yeah, sure."" I ask for the check and tip 33% of the bill, common for me if it's a low check/good deal like this.Head to the bathroom with all my stuff (my coat and my laptop) still on the stool and a 1/3 of a drink still left, come back and my drink and water are removed. No way he could've thought I was gone seeing all my stuff was still prominently there. I think about flagging him over as he greets his other patrons warmly, but I didn't care enough...so I simply stand there for a few minutes to see if I'm acknowleged. Nada.Hate to say it, but if I hadn't been a single young female dining on her own, I strongly suspect I wouldn't have been treated that way. Never returning, even though I'm a block away.

1.0,9/25/2011,"Ended up here for brunch because brunch at Park Ave Tavern was a bust (two thumbs down for advertising brunch on Saturday and Sundays, but only really serving it on Sunday!)  Docks $23 bottomless brunch was an enticing alternative. You can't go wrong with unlimited drinks, right? Eh...The bread/muffin basket was nice and unexpected, but it only went downhill from there. The ""mimosas"" were just straight OJ - no champagne whatsoever! Finally on the third drink, we said something and noticed a slight difference, but not a huge improvement. Sometimes I can deal with bad drinks if the food makes up for it. Yeah....no. I ordered the cheese omelette, where it states you have a choice of ""gruyere, Vermont goat or cheddar cheese"" (this is exactly how it is stated on the menu- does goat cheese even come from Vermont?). The also had a spinach and goat cheese omelette on the menu, but I really just wanted the cheese (no need to throw in a veggie when you're already eating all that crap, right?) Ordering went something like this:Me: ""I'd like the cheese omelette with goat cheese"".Waitress: ""Wait...so do you want the spinach and goat cheese?""Me: ""No, here it says with the cheese omelette that I have my choice of these three cheeses. I want goat cheese""Waitress: ""Okay, so you want the Vermont?""Me: ""If it's goat cheese, yes""....and I end up with a cheddar cheese omelette. It was fluffy and cheese was ""oozing"" out. By oozing, I mean that was 90% of the cheese that was actually in the omelette ended up outside of the omelette. I was less than impressed. One friend got the Cajun omelette and was satisfied, another friend got the scrambled eggs and was content, but my friend who got the benedict ended up with pretty much two hard boiled eggs. It was gross.Lessons learned from this brunch:- if you're going to Park Ave Tavern (or anywhere, actually), double check what day they're actually serving brunch. Even if they have a huge sign advertising brunch on both days, as well as this stated on their website, apparently it means nothing. Otherwise, you might end up with a brunch like this lousy one at Docks.- ""Bottomless mimosas"" actually means "" bottomless OJ, possibly a splash of champagne"".-When presented with 3 cheese options for an omelette, ""Vermont goat or cheddar cheese"" really just means cheddar.-Eggs benedict is now being served with hard-boiled instead of poached eggs.Skip this brunch, unless you're standing on the corner of 40th and 3rd, and it starts raining.

The menu was great - so many wonderful choices, including a prix fixe menu that looked very reasonable (and tasty.) I opted for the clam chowder and penne primavera with shrimp and diver scallops. Both were excellent, though the chowder needed a little more seasoning and the scallops were just a tad overdone. No biggie - it was still delicious. The chowder wasn't lacking in clams and the pasta was filled to the brim with perfectly cooked shrimp and huge scallops.My co-worker went with the steak and fries - he said it was one of the best ribeyes he's ever had.

5.0,6/18/2011,"S texted and happy hour was in order. We decided to check out Docks (no apostrophe, people!!!) and it was one of the best happy hours I've been to in a long time... So we arrived at the restaurant at 6pm. The interior definitely keeps it classy with all its details. I especially like the large windows and high ceilings after being confined in an office all day. As for the actual bar, it was oval and I'm definitely a fan of that because staring at a wall while sitting on a bar stool is boring as hell. The scene was bustling with friendly folks enjoying their drinks and eats. Here's what we ordered: 1) raw oysters ($1 each): they were fairly refreshing with a faint sweetness to it. I forget the name, but they were OK i guess. Just don't go in expecting a kumamoto type of experience and you'll be fine. 2) raw clams (.50 each): they have littlenecks or cherrystones which are quality clams. I actually enjoyed the clams better than the oysters! 3) spicy tuna roll ($5): they were kinda small, but OK. It's not much of a deal in general, but over here it is relative to the pricing of other menu items. 4) spicy buffalo calamari ($6): great flavor, but a serious fail on the watery blue cheese dressing 5) IPA on draft ($3.50): not bad. I can't remember the name of this either. 6) chardonnay ($6) TIP: they ran out of the $1.50 pulled pork/beef sliders so order them once you get there... In terms of service, Liz, the bartender, was excellent: 1) fast 2) drink memory: no need to remind her what your beverage of choice is 3) funny: so you have to place your food order through the bartender. Since our drinks were against the wall, I asked her how I'd know my food was ready at the bar. She laughs and says, ""I'm just going to scream out your name!"" I thought she was joking since she was so sweet. But she really did scream out ""HEY HARVEY~!!!"" like a drill sergeant throughout the night.

3.0,5/28/2011,"Despite some of the iffy reviews, I did not have a bad experience here at Dock's. It was somewhere between a 3.5 and 4. Though, if you do read that some have gotten food poisoning from the oyster happy hour special- steer clear! I'm always distrusting of oysters that came cheap, anyway. In my case, I was invited to Dock's for a business lunch. From the outside, the place doesn't look like much (I will admit I had thought it was a burger joint at first!), but it's actually quite nice. Or rather, quite spacious. Lots and lots of tables, large bar space, etc. It seems an appropriate business spot since the decor is not very romantic, or family-cozy at all- it' s just vast, and steakhouse-esque. I will say that the decor looks very clean though- simple with its dark brown wood everywhere and modest paintings. I came on Friday at 12:30 (normal lunch time) and the place was empty. It was also the Friday start to Memorial Day weekend, so it could be that. A bunch of more tables started getting filled toward the 1:30-2pm time slot, so I guess people decided to grab a late lunch and head out for the rest of the day. My companion and I sat near the window, and I'd arrived early. The hostess let me sit and wait at the table, which is always appreciated over the bar. As for the menu, I'd say there is no real differentiation between lunch and dinner.... it was really expensive. Entrees ran from low-high 20s, but then again, we're talking seafood and fish. They had more ""lunch"" items, such as the crab cake sandwich (what my partner got), and soups/salads. My companion started off with the New England Clam Chowder, and the crab cake sandwich (and an iced tea, which came in a Mason jar :) )In all honesty, the chowder did not look too fresh. It looked like the can. Reason I say this was because when my partner started mixing it up, there were microscopic folds of the surface churning about (you can't fool me! I've been to chowder land just to pig out and taste chowders, aka Boston, Seattle and Vancouver). And it looks almost TOO thick to be super fresh. Hmmm. (Of course I did not taste, mind you). The crab cake sandwich seemed good, but standard. Came on a clean plate with a small cone of fries (thickly cut, and pure, with little salt- my style :) ), and a regular sized side of aioli. I was going to go for the Maryland crab cake entree myself, but thought better of my diet and went for fish. The pan seared dover sole- which was at market price. This is was as simple as simple fish dishes go. Simple but very tasty. Sole itself is a light but very flaky and flavorful fish. Pan sear it with LOTS of butter...well who can deny butter is uber tasty?Aside from lots of butter, the fish came with capers (my fav), and croutons, which I think remains to be the key to the dish. It gave it a nice crunchy texture amongst all that white flakiness. The waiter did ask me if I wanted it fileted before he served it (dur!), so you have that option but note  you loose a bit of fish. And I'm sure it ain't cheap. The side of vegetables are very forgettable so they're not even worth writing about other than to say 1) they were a bad selection- asparagus, squash, carrots, and 2)  hardly cooked! Somewhere between sauteed and just raw. The croutons I think made the dish extra creative. But towards the end, I did get a little sick of the fish. It was in part just the fishy context of sole, but also the fact that there might have been a little TOO much butter. I'd say overall server was fine. Pretty standoff ish so unremarkable, which is fine because I didn't need over-politeness. Timing of the food was fine, and so was the water refilling.Oh, and a quick tip about the bread basket. Good but not great as everything says. Kind of standard for a seafood joint.  White, wheat/nut slices, with some seeded crackers..served with butter. Meh.

2.0,3/7/2011,"*Happy hour review only*FOOD POISON ALERT!!I met a couple friends for happy hour here on a Wednesday to take advantage of the oysters for $1 M-F between 3-7pm.  Considering we were just there for happy hour at the bar, I'm not expecting 5-star service or food...just some drinks and food for cheap.We ordered 2 dozen oysters (not all at once...this becomes relevant later), beef and pulled pork sliders, spicy salmon roll, and some wine.  When my friend first asked the bartender what their house wine was, he just pointed to the menu like, ""duh, why don't you just look at this"".  Then my friend had to ask specifically, ""WHAT wine is it (brand), not the kind (pinot grigio, merlot, etc)"".  This is important to her, as she works in the restaurant industry and pretty knowledgeable when it comes to that kind of stuff.  I couldn't care less, so I'll just take whatever they're serving, but still, his service was pretty rude.  And after 2 rounds of drinks and all that food, our bill came out to $30 each...not bad at all.  I can't complain...yet.  Nothing stood out as being exceptionally good, nor noticeably bad...until the next day.  Thursday after dinner, I suddenly felt totally nauseous and threw up twice within half an hour.  For the following 18 hours, I was sick in bed, and must have been running back and forth from the bathroom like every 20 minutes.  Since my happy hour at Dock's was like 24 hours before my episode started, I didn't initially blame my food poisoning on their food.  But after reading up on food poisoning, I learned that it can hit you 4-48 hours after you eat the bad food.  I ended up meeting up with my friends again 2 days later on Friday night, and it turned out that the 2 of them both ended up getting sick the night before as well.  One of them thought she just threw up because of indigestion, and the other thought the she got sick because she mixed clear and dark alcohol when she went out Thursday night.  But when we put all the pieces together, and 3 out of 3 people who ate the oysters at Dock's the night before got sick, it's pretty safe to say that that was the culprit.  That's too bad...I really liked the $1/oyster happy hour deal :/",2,0,0,Jackie K.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",220,138,43

4.0,7/12/2010,"A friend recommended Dock's to me because I was looking for a good seafood place. My date and I were both very impressed. The waitress was very friendly and the food was really good with huge portions and a decent price.I started with the Caribbean Special Roll (blue crab, mango, and pineapple) which was so sweet and delicious. For my meal, I got the Marinated Mixed Seafood Grill which came with shrimp, tuna, and salmon in what tasted like a smoked sauce. This was good, but probably the least entertaining of everything I had that night. I also wish there were more than just two little shrimp.My date is the true seafood lover of the two of us, so he ordered a half dozen oysters. They have different oysters each day and he chose the ones that the waitress described as more on the sweet side. My date really liked them and said he could've eaten 3 dozen. I tried one and had to have another, they were so good. As for his meal, he ordered from their prix fixe menu which is a really great deal for seafood, $32 for a 3-course meal. He ordered the mussels as the appetizer, which was a huuuuuge bowl. He gave me probably what other places would've called an appetizer-sided portion, yet he still had more than twice that left for himself. I really liked the mussels, they were perfectly cooked, not at all chewy. For his entree, he ordered the steamed 1lb Alaskan King Crab Legs. He said they were amazing; I had a bite and agreed.  For dessert, we got the keylime pie which was good but next time I will probably try the vanilla bean creme caramel instead.All in all, a great meal for a good price. With a half bottle of wine, the bill came to $120. Not bad for everything we ate. We will definitely be back again soon.",1,0,0,A J.,"Floral Park, NY",132,174,0

The waiter was hilarious, and egged us on quite a bit. Since the happy hour didn't begin until 4pm we ordered a sashimi platter to begin with. The beer on tap was to our liking, and the sushi was delicious. Finally, 4pm rolled around (we were a bit toasted at this point). So, we ordered some oysters and clams from the raw bar. None of us had ever eaten raw clams, so we only ordered a few. Thank god we did, because they were not to any of our liking. The only negative thing I can say about our afternoon was that they don't have shot glasses. So, when I ordered a ""shooter"" they laughed and made us 3 glasses of basically bloody Mary mix, vodka, and an oyster in it. It took us 4 gulps before we could even finish the shot. This was a problem.6 beers, sashimi, oysters, clams, prosecco, 3 shooters (or drinks with oysters in them), buffalo calamari, grilled onion sliders, and a spicy tuna roll later, and we called it a day.

We had to wait another 10 minutes before she returned and reminded her that we'd still like to order. We finally received the menu and ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy sandwich.Now being a po'boy sandwich virgin, I was expecting something more than tiny handful of fried shrimp presented on a  giant loaf of not-so-fresh French bread. Whatever anyone raved about a po'boy before is all thrown out the window. If I'd wanted to grossly overpay for shrimp and bread, I would have gone to Whole Foods and made a much better one myself.Maybe they were hoping by the time I got through the bread, I would have forgotten what I had ordered in the first place.Definitely not quality and not somewhere I'd ever go back.",4,2,1,Lianne Z.,"New York, NY",333,279,5
