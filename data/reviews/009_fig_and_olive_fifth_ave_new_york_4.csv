4.0,4/21/2019,This was our second visit to Fig & Olive and we continued to find exciting new items on the menu. Loved the variety of the bruschetta appetizers available and of the entrees.

2.0,4/18/2019,"made a reservation for Sunday brunch with a friend a few weeks ago - was seated promptly upon. the staff working was great, which is the only reason why this restaurant isn't a 1 star.I ordered a fig and olive salad, added grilled chicken. my friend ordered the steak and eggs. the portion size was TINY, not to mention we each paid $30+ for each entrée plus tax and tip.the salad was underwhelming, the dressing was bland, the chicken was dry, and my friend stated that her steak was overdone and not seasoned well. will never be back",1,1,1,Ruby K.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",335,314,136
4.0,4/10/2019,"First time to visit this restaurant and I was very pleased with everything we were served. Started with some really tart Italian white wine (I wish I could remember the name; my colleague ordered it) that was lovely and then came the appetizer we had a trio of crostini's that we're really nice; manchego & fig, beef tartare, and shrimp with chili and cilantro. They all tasted really nice, but at $24 for 6 pieces, it felt a bit on the high side of reasonable. The main course was a really special; wild mushroom rigatoni that must be experienced again. I don't usually gush over pasta, but in this case it was practically required. I think they had to be using a mushroom stock to get the concentrated flavor that the dish had. At the end I had a lovely French inspired apple tart that was perfectly baked and seasoned; lightly sweet with just a hint of tartness. The bottom line is I would go back here regularly, but it would be really hard not to order the mushroom pasta every time. The service was very attentive without being intrusive or ""cute"". Everyone was very professional and aware of the details that make dining out something to be savored. My compliments to the chef and his team for a memorable and delicious experience, and to the front of the house staff who complemented the kitchen in every way. Nicely done.",0,0,0,Kevin S.,"Woodinville, WA",89,7,0
4.0,4/4/2019,"Years ago, I went to Fig & Olive and since then I couldn't stop thinking about the delicious crostinis! The rest of the food is expensive and forgettable but the crostinis are a must have. They are 3 for $11 or 6 for $19. It's a bit less costly during happy hour. Some of the flavors might sound weird and questionable but it works. They are all delicious! I didn't think that the gorgonzola would be good (apple and red pepper marmalade), but it ended up being one of my favorites. The forest mushroom is my second favorite. It is so flavorful! Try them all, they are all good choices!",11,1,8,Anna L.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",55,287,506

4.0,2/9/2019,"** Restaraunt Week **Made reservations for 5pm on a Friday in early February. Hosts lazily greeted us with a blank  robotic face. Room was close to empty. Only downstairs area was open to dine. Tables/seats are too close to each other. We ordered :Mushroom croquetteGrilled cauliflowerLemon ChickenSalmonWhite & milk chocolate mouseCheesecakeComplimentary bread and oil dips were placed - simply good I must admit. We had ordered the croquettes before realizing they had a restaurant week menu, but the waiter was nice about it and adjusted it to our bill. After all it was also part of the rest. week menu. Both the cauliflower and mushroom apps were delicious! We think the lemon chicken was undercooked. When the concern was raised, the waiter reassured us it was cooked fully through but sometimes roasting chicken and/or other way of cooking poultry doesn't always make the meat white. Unfortunately we had already lost our appetite. The salmon dish was amazingly tasty. The desserts were a great ending. Not too sweet, not too heavy. The cheesecake was on the fluffier side and smooooothe. For the mouse, I highly reccomend taking a scoop of the top white chocolate first. Then only a scoop of the milk chocolate. Finally, both together. You're welcome!The room got packed within 30-45 mins after arriving, yet the ambiance remained the same. Staff increased on the floor but there was no sense of rush or anxious table clearing. Fig & Olive succesfully brings you their tasting experience by combining unique vegetable / fruit flavors and their contrasting colors.

The food was so disappointing! The potato leek soup lacked flavor. Mushroom croquettes were ""ok"" & needed seasoning. My chicken was dry and cheap portions for the price! My boyfriend's ""paella"" (is that what you're calling it, fig & olive? Pfft) ..had no flavor and also cheap with the portion. We were very Underwhelmed & would not come back. Restaurant week is supposed to bring customers to your restaurant, bring attention to it & give opportunities for people who normally couldn't afford to try an expensive restaurant, be able to.

We got lucky as it was restaurant week so for $42 we got a 3 course dinner which was a great value since most entrees average $20-$45 and apps average $10-20. Fairly well run small chain.

4.0,1/26/2019,"I never Been Fig & Olive before. We went there for New York restaurant week. It was full house,and pretty crowded. We picked the restaurant week menu first they served us olive oil and bread. There were two kinds of olive oils which is orange flavored it was so delicious. Also 18 years old balsamic vinegar. I had roasted cauliflower as a starter. Which was really good and was not too crunchy. Cocktails were awesome too. I had Moroccan old fashion which was very interesting and never tried before. Normally old fashioned look like more orangey but this one was taste like  lemonish. As a entree I had organic lemon chicken which was really good too. Because of they served gigantic size of roasted cauliflower, I wouldn't be able to finish my entrée.  Dessert was so delicious as well but size of dessert not satisfied me as a sweet tooth.

We decided on the crostinis (which could be mix/matched) and split a salad. All were excellent. We also shared the dessert tasting dish. It was a perfect size to share a small, sweet bite.

The space has a really nice vibe to it, although it was a little bit crowded where we were sitting upstairs (I was almost touching backs with the table behind us) I only noticed the slight tightness of space when food was being served. Drinks were all great, as were appetizers (Potato leek soup and Scallops were my favorite). Everyone loved their dinners, the only meal that was slightly underwhelming was the paella which did not have a ton of complexity to its flavor but was still pretty good.My only complaint was that it took a while for our orders to be taken, and for us to actually be served, and our dinner took almost 3 hours. It was definitely busy that night but it was slightly frustrating that we had to flag a person over to take our orders for dinner/desert, even after we told them that 2 people in our group was headed to a show at 8.Overall would return again, great spot for a date night or a group dinner!",1,1,4,Yara F.,"New York, NY",137,276,362

I came in a group of 5 and we were seated upstairs, which was roomier and we had a view of the street. The place is very busy, so a reservation is recommended, if not required, to get a table.

The truffle pasta dish was alright, but the chicken my husband added to the dish was flavorless and he likened it to the chicken you get on an airplane. The quinoa kale salad was very fresh and the portion was large, but again, it lacked flavor despite having lots of items that should indeed be packed with flavor. Atmosphere was lovely, location was convenient for Times Square, Radio City, Broadway shows and Rockefeller. However, service wasn't friendly at all, nor helpful with questions about the menu.

We had the smoked salmon and crime fraiche, the prosciutto, the manchego with fig and almonds, one goat cheese and carmelized onion and one with shrimp. Then we had the roasted cauliflower. It was fantastic - different from all other places I've had it. It was very soft-not crispy and had a light sauce on it.  Delicious!  For main courses we chose branzino, Chilean sea bass, glazed balsamic short rib and lobster primavera ravioli. All were outstanding. The short rib could have used a littlemore balsamic but it was tender as can be and melted in your mouth. It served with polenta. The branzino was cooked perfectly with a little crisp on the outside and it was served with wax beans and tiny little potatoes. The lobster primavera were very flavorful. The sea bass had a citrusy flavor to it that was really great. We topped it all off with the pear sangria.

That's where the positive ended I'm afraidThey seated us at a wobbly table and it took 2 different guys before it stopped. After that it was extremely hot upstairs where we were seated and they didn't have any seating downstairs. At least they turned the heat down and made it bearable. My wife ordered the sea bass (which was the best fish dish she ever ate back in 2015) and it was ok. My first order of short ribs I could barely cut with the knife (should be fork tender). I called the Waiter over and instead of taking it back right away he said let me get my manager, then came back a few min later and took the plate saying they would make a new on. They did and it was acceptable but far from the best short ribs I have had for half the price.

First of all I walked right in around 6:30 and was seated immediately. The service from the host to the busboy to the server was prompt, friendly and professional. The atmosphere was nicely lit, comfortable, not trendy. A range of ages - young women after work, business meetings, dates, parents visiting their daughter in the big city. I felt perfectly comfortable as Grandma on her own! I had a cocktail, then the Chefs Selection 3 apps, they were all different but went together perfectly. I had them on the crispy polenta. It was plenty because I wanted to have dessert. That was a wise decision! I had the dessert sampler- OMG- with a Prosecco to boot.

3.0,10/5/2018,"I've been going to this location for over a year and the service getting worse and worse. Food is great, but waiters and hosts always have an attitude. And every time I go back, seems like the attitude goes worse. I feel like they doing me a favor by serving me a meal. Me and my friend wanted to order crostini, but I wanted it on zucchini and she wanted on the focaccia. So we thought we'll take 6 for $22, the waiter said we had to only opt for zucchini or focaccia and it's not negotiable, which is ridiculous. But if I took 3 for $12 and she took 3 for $12 of the same order, chef wouldn't mind. Basically, if you want 6 pieces on different base you should overpay $4. 6 separate pieces with different toppings!!! But the base should be the same. And when waiter said it's not an option, because that is chefs suggestion and he respects chef, made us feel he just doesn't respect their paying customers. Tea and other utensils were taking without asking if we finished with it, never mentioned the last call. Split our bill not in two, which were just 2 of us, but in 3. And was handed to us with roll of the eyes. Overall, negative experience, once more. If it wasn't for great company and good food, I would rate it 1 star.

At the beginning, he only asked my friend if she needs any drinks but ignored me completely. ( PS: i am the only one Asian in the group hehe) Later, he forgot to bring us the bread but he did bring it to everybody else. Plus, it literally took us almost 20 to 30 mins to find him to start ordering our food and another half hour to find him to bring our check.

They were all delicious but the marinated shrimp was exquisite. For main course we ordered the paella noir and short ribs. The ribs were melting in our mouths and the fried polenta was amazing! I am not a great rice fan but being a foodie, I was very interested in the squid ink (therefore, noir) rice. It was delicious. With jumbo shrimps and a (very large) sea scallops, clams all made to perfection. The drinks... they have an interesting and innovative ones. I had the cucumber cosmo which was refreshing (yes, a cocktail could be ) and really tasty. For this alone, I would come back for happy hour or drinks anytime! The other drink we had was Riviera Punch with a strong strawberry flavor, was tasty but a bit too sweet for our palette. We had Tawny port wine and another cucumber Cosmo for dessert (we had no room for the interesting desserts on the menu).The service was great.

3.0,8/11/2018,"This place is pretty average, and you're paying for the status and the name. I went there for restaurant week, and I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed with my choice.First, they set us at the table that was the closest to the kitchen; it was extremely hot, and we often were bumped by the members of the service staff. They were kind of rude/terse; I understand that it's restaurant week, and you guys were serving a lot of people, but maybe you shouldn't put patrons right next to the kitchen.I ordered the the croquettes, the lamb burger, and the pot de creme dessert. The croquettes were okay, my favorite was the one with bacon. They could have been a bit warmer. The mushroom was my least favorite, however I loved the various types of aioli.Second was the lamb burger, and I was disappointed. It came with potato wedges - they were cold and rubbery. The lamb tasted good, however then bread was far too thick. There was too much feta and goat cheese, and not enough dates.The dessert was the best thing on the menu, it was perfect. I wish it would have been bigger, so I wouldn't have felt like my time was so much of a waste.

2.0,8/8/2018,"We came here for restaurant week. We ended up ordering lunch off the regular menu. The food was very good. The issue is the service. We first sat at the bar. I didn't like my first drink and asked for another. The bartender seemed annoyed and after getting the new drink and me misunderstanding an ingredient, proceeded to whisper about me down the bar to his coworker. Um, this isn't high school,  boys. They seemed more concerned about getting ready for dinner during our late lunch than worrying about those pesky customers. Same situation in the back of the restaurant on the first floor. The bus team was speaking loudly to the kitchen, crashing dishes and just kind of unaware of those pesky customers, again. When our food was ready, it was plunked down on the table with precision, not accompanied by any kind of charm or awareness people would actually be eating it. Yes, those pesky customers again. The food is quite good. But the entire team needs some major training on service. This is I think a high traffic restaurant that gets a lot of tourists and workers in the area, given its location. I live and work in Manhattan so I'm very cognizant of the levels of service you usually see at a higher end restaurant. Maybe at one time this restaurant was different, but perhaps high traffic has convinced employees here that they no longer need to concern themselves with the customers who so rudely interrupt their joking around and time hanging out. Service is rarely an issue in Manhattan because it's a tough environment to open and maintain restaurants.

The croquette tasting was pretty good -- my favorite was the basil sauce. I also tried my friend's salmon crudo which tasted nothing more than some smoked salmon with pomegranate seeds. The risotto was also more bland than I would've imagined, but still good otherwise. Kinda wished they incorporated more corn though since it's advertised as a sweet corn risotto. The popcorn was a cool touch! And the pot de creme was good. My favorite part was probably the vanilla cream on top, and the chocolate at the bottom was a cute surprise! All the dishes were portioned well and I was definitely super full after! Probably wouldn't come back if it weren't during restaurant week tho since the quality isn't really worth the price.

3.0,7/15/2018,"My friends picked this spot for girls night out to try some Mediterranean fare, but we were not entirely impressed. The space is sultry, with white tabletops and terracotta furnitures. Olive oil plays a highlight in their dishes and the decor, with rows and rows of high-end olive oil lining the space. The bar was one of the longest I'd seen and spacious. I also bumped into a colleague with his date on a Saturday night, so F&O seems to be a popular Midtown spot.The food is mediocre however. We tried an array of dishes, including soups, crostinis and entrees. I don't think they were worth the price for what you get. A lot of small bites that don't warrant their high costs. The savior were their signature crostinis that came in an array of flavors. The best were the Mushroom Truffle with artichoke, truffle, parmesan. The Shrimp topped with avocado and tomato. And the Manchego with fig and a marcona almond. We all agreed the crostinis were delicious, and if we'd done a whole dinner of them, the experience would have been much more satisfactory. The F&O Tajine with chicken, baby vegetables, and sides of couscous and harissa was pretty on the plate, but bland in flavor. It could use a lot more spices, as tajines I've had were always packed with flavors, though always African, and not Mediterranean.

Found the olives to be exuberantly salty and the scallops bland; but as you can imagine, we made it work. 3.5 stars each. I asked first for the Porterhouse with much excitement. Server came back and reported that they were out of this item. Pues... New Zealand lamb chops it is! Wanted medium-rare and got medium. Searched for salt the whole time. The crispy rosemary was aromatic, but not extraordinary. And definitely burnt. The provided side of garlic oil would've been sexier on the dish vs. on the side. 3 stars. The lobster ravioli was enticing and included 6 or so raviolis with chunky sauce. Very alluring and well-prepared.  Just a bit more cauliflower than I had planned for. 4.5 stars.

3.0,6/3/2018,"I've been to all of the F&O locations and love their food but I don't think this location is great. The staff there are all incredibly kind and accommodating. We split 6 Crostini which as usual were delicious. We also got the Provençal baked eggs, French toast, and truffle fontina eggs. We asked about the French omelette and if it was soft and runny on the inside like a traditional one would be, and were told no it wasn't, which was confusing and a little disappointing since that's what we wanted, and weren't sure why t was called a French omelette then. The Provençal eggs were good but a bit over salted, the French toast flavorful but dry, and the truffle fontina eggs good flavors but oily. I felt like I had to ask for a lot of things to ""Doctor it up"", which you shouldn't have to do when you're paying that much. Overall the food was fine, maybe it was an off day, but not wonderful like. We had one person in our party in a wheelchair and it wasn't a problem in the slightest. The only thing I'd mention in terms of that is that the waitstaff had no idea that there was a handicapped bathroom (the regular one is up a flight of stares) and when we asked what do they do about those who will need to use it, he replied ""I don't know, they don't come here"".

1.0,5/18/2018,"TIME: Friday night 6:30 dinner reservation for two. AMBIENCE: It was a packed night and loud. I was surprised at how tight the spaces were. We got a table at the end of the wall so it was a little ""quieter"". FOOD: We shared the scallops appetizer and for entrees, I ordered the Moroccan Chicken and my friend got the Pasta with Salmon. First impression of the scallops were how big the plate was for such a small amount (2 pieces). I found the scallops to be a bit too salty so when my entree arrived and found it surprisingly tame in taste, it was a relieve. This was, however, very short-lived because by the third bite I couldn't taste any flavor. Not in the chicken, carrots, or even in the olives! Everything was just BLAND. Nothing like a true Moroccan dish would ever taste like. My friend was eyeing the olives and I told her to take them and she agreed they had no taste. The only good point it got was that the chicken skin was crispy. That's all.SERVICE: When my friend asked the waiter what type of pasta it was, he said ""it's the flat one""... yea, thanks for the clear explanation. My friend had a glass of white wine and a waiter passing by just reached over and took it. She hadn't finished it. I wished they were as quick with the water but we were completely ignored after we were done with our meal.

5.0,5/12/2018,"While in NY I had the chance to go here for lunch. I ordered the prix fixe with tomato bisque, riviera salmon and dessert crostini. My friend and I started of with some bread, olive oil and vinegar - high quality olive oil which is not always the case as it can turn much faster than anticipated. Next came the bisque and that was unfortunately not very tasty. It was just plain salty - my guess is that they let it simmer for too long and overestimated the salt needed. When I mentioned this to our waiter he brought out a croquette tasting plate and it was delicious. Not at all oily and each sauce added a very different note to the basic croquette. Then came the main dish - riviera salmon. Cooked exactly the way salmon is supposed to be cooked, great presentation and the fennel slaw was an unusual yet excellent side. We finished with the dessert ""crostini"" and were both pleasantly surprised how the chef evened out the fruit and the mascarpone cream.

Paired with the series of olive oils, you will be quite happy as soon as you sit down. For appetizers, I tried the croquettes. If you only order one thing here, this should be it. The crispy outside with delicious cheese and hints of truffle were to die for. I ate all of them and did not care to share. For my entree I went with the truffle risotto. The texture was perfect and the truffle and mushrooms were the perfect combination. I lapped this up and was quite happy. For dessert, I tried the pot de crepe. This was very rich and perfect for chocolate lovers. I was satisfied with a few bites. Overall, a perfect evening out with idyllic service and food that was above and beyond expectations.

While the establishment accepts reservations, I saw plenty of available seating in the later afternoon (~4PM). I didn't have to wait long for my food, and the servers were pleasant enough. Got the vibe that they wouldn't care if I did complain about anything, though. Absolutely no one bothered to tell me it was happy hour; instead I went along with full dinner menu.  I ordered the cheese board and penne funghi with wine and limoncello to drink. While the pasta drowned in too much olive oil and the pickings on the cheeseboard were a little too meager to justify its price, the food wasn't bad. The sangiovese was excellent, though. Total came out to $86 (with tip, $105), a little more than I was expecting.Overall an adequate dining experience, but not much incentive to return.",1,0,0,Lyra M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,12,0

2.0,2/27/2018,"Unfortunately quite disappointing. I hate to give two stars, but honestly given the quality of the food and the service and the relatively high prices I cannot get myself to give 3 stars. We were a party of 3 on a Monday night with a 7:15 reservation. We were seated at the back of the restaurant, the table was decent but there was room upstairs, and I suspect those seats would have been better.Service started out reasonably well, the server recommended a number of dishes, pointed out that they were well known for the crostini, and gave some advice regarding the various menu options. The appetizers came out fairly quickly. The seared scallops were quite good, well seasoned, and not overcooked, with a good sear on the outside. A good start so far. The crostini were disappointing over all, we ordered a number of different ones including octopus, goat cheese, shrimp, mushroom, and squash. The octopus was overcooked, the goat cheese was scarce, the shrimp was reasonable though the avocado guac it came on seemed to have some preservatives, I didn't taste the mushroom one, and the squash tasted like pear and was sweeter than it should have been. Further, the bread for the crostini was a bit too thin, and could have been better chosen.The mains came out about 15 minutes afterwards, shrimp and salmon salad, bouillabaisse, seafood paella. The salad was good, but its hard to mess up an arugula salad with shrimp and one piece of salmon. The bouillabaisse was lackluster, the saving grace was the scallops, the broth left a lot to be desired. The paella didn't come, they brought out a chicken dish instead.  When I told them that I had ordered paella they took away the chicken and I had to wait 15 more minutes for my dish to come. There was no apology, no comped dessert or any type of compensation. The paella that did eventually come out was soggy and the seafood tasted quite flavorless. It was clear that they tried to quick fire a paella and did not do a very good job of it. Again the only good parts of the paella were the scallops and the shrimp. It seems that this restaurant is pretty good at making scallops. What really bothered me was that there was no apology, in no way did they try to make up for the fact that they messed up the order and then delivered substandard food. I don't plan on going back to this place, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",4,0,1,Timir D.,"New York, NY",158,231,269

Fig and Olive is a perfect spot for just that. I was shopping at lunch time 2 Friday's ago. My daughter and I sat at the bar- there was a wait for a table. We had a glass of Sauvignon blanc some marinated olives, focaccia and waited for lunch. It was served quickly. She had the chicken pail lard which was not fried but done quickly on the flat top and looked lovely over arugula salad. She enjoyed it very much. The lady to my right had the same with a glass of bubbly rose. She was in town on business from San Francisco and said this is her go to spot...great to know and great to meet her too.    I had the salad with grilled shrimp and grilled salmon on top.

This was my first time at Fig and Olive and I had always heard great things about the restaurant. Walking in with a party of three, the decor was amazing and I expected quality service that matched the decor.What we got was a waiter who consistently forgot who got what food (a hazard to those who have food allergies). And the worse part was the serving of the dessert. It was Friend A's birthday and we were also celebrating some other life accomplishments for Friend B. Friend A and I ordered a pastry like dessert. And Friend B ordered a chocolate dessert. A chocolate dessert came out with a candle for Friend A and we thought it was a nice complementary dessert the restaurant gave for Friend A's birthday. It wasn't until later that we realized Friend B did not have a dessert coming that the waiter actually took Friend B's dessert, stuck a candle in it, and gave it to Friend A.

4.0,2/5/2018,"T.H. and I came here for date night very recently and discovered they were all set up for restaurant week! So normally restaurant week means a lot of the food is sub par and prepped en masse and the crowd is more boisterous to put it nicely. Luckily the food quality at this location of Fig and Olive seemed unaffected. I went for the Prix fixe as I wanted an appetizer as well but TH just went straight for the dry aged steak. I started out with the classic Fig and Olive salad which had a nice balance between the sweet figs, the crunchy walnuts, the acidic dressing and the tart fresh apples. Definitely a good salad but also a large portion for someone my size. The next course I had was the duck breast which was nestled on a bed of shaved beets and accompanied by some roasted fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were a little overdone but still didn't throw off the dish entirely. The amount of shaved beets was a little odd given that it took over half the dish but it gave a little extra sweetness to what could have been a dry dish. For dessert I opted for the chocolate pot with praline and foam. All together a good dessert with a perfectly made chocolate mousse and vanilla foam. I almost wish there was a little more foam as I don't have a huge sweet tooth but you order chocolate, you get chocolate,  no complaints.TH's aged steak was cooked very precisely and had a great flavor being dry aged and all. It was accompanied by three sauces, a watercress salad, and potatoes. All in all, he inhaled the steak with the sauces but also found that the potatoes were a little overdone. Additionally, we both thought that the watercress salad could have used a little extra acidity to balance out a decadent dish. All in all, we're giving it 4 stars because the food was good and I'd come again but there were some small things that could have been done better. Though I almost assume that's also because of the restaurant week rush.",1,0,0,Caroline L.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,94,56

5.0,12/22/2017,"Lovely Mediterranean restaurant! It's very close to Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral so it's a nice option in a neighborhood that isn't overrun with places to eat. The pre- fix menu is really nice. The carrot-ginger soup is a delicious, spicy appetizer. They even serve it by placing a bowl with finishings in front of you and pouring the soup on top out of a carafe. The table begins the meal with bread and three different types of olive oil-of which you can actually really taste the different flavor nuances. The fig and olive tajine is a flavorful chicken entree. The service is great- when I asked our waiter for a dessert recommendation he brought us both! The entrees can take a long time to arrive, even outside of busy hours. The interior is classy, especially the second floor. It's a popular place- we went on a late Thursday evening and there was still a decent crowd.",0,0,0,Meghan O.,"Astoria, New York, NY",1,29,21

One of my friends had a dish that came with a yellow sauce and when I asked the waiter if I could have a side of the yellow sauce he told me my sandwich is paired with the green one because the flavors compliment each other. I told him I understood but I didn't like the green one. He finally got me the yellow one but didn't seem too pleased about it.

Our hostess Vera was so sweet and accommodating. She got us a sweet romantic corner spot in the dining section. And our server Mike was just amazing! We informed him that it was our anniversary and he immediately got some champagne out for us. They started us out with some complimentary fig and olive bread and three types of oil from Spain and Greece. For appetizers We ordered 3 crosstinis --  goat cheese,mushroom and burrata. They  tasted sooo exquisite I fell in love with each bite. For entrees we ordered the Penne Funghi and Truffle Risotto. Both dishes were excellent! They come cooked in truffle oil and with shaved truffles on them. The Risotto was so creamy and delicious. I remember telling my husband that the food is so good I can die now and also remember telling him that even though it's our anniversary I want to kiss the chef. The best food!

F&O burger returns and is now ""medium"" - and i mean medium-pink all the way through and an attempt to seer the middle of the burger (which i had sliced with my knife upon eating the first time).What really annoys me beyond is the lack of ANY concern from your waitstaff, chef, or maitre d'.

We ordered a fig and olive salad which was heavily dressed to the point were it lingered in your palette just too long.  Although the olives and figs in this salad should be a dish on its own - really great!  The waiter did offer to take back the salad, but we choose to stick to it.

The accompanying salad was huge and delicious with shaved brussel sprouts and haricot vert and was great.

But the best was the waiter. I wish I remembered his name but he was so quirky and strange and deadpan and I'm not sure if he was joking or not. He'd say things like are you having the most wonderful summer ever but with a flat serious face. You'd order something and he'd say ""wow"" but again flat and expressionless.

He gave you details if you have any questions about the food. He even offered a free dessert when they couldn't accommodate my friend's takeout request (which, imo, is unreasonable LOL). About the food. We ordered Fig & Olive salad and mushroom croquettes. Both were delicious! The salad was fresh and opened up my appetite. The mushroom croquettes were creamy and had a hint of truffle oil aroma, although I think they were over-fried a little bit. If I had to be picky, the food came out a little bit slow. We waited for quite a while for our main courses. We chose Fig & Olive tajine and the salmon. The salmon was okay, a bit overcooked, but the onions underneath were yummy and soft.  The best part was the tajine. The chicken meat was so juicy, tender, and flavorful! Seriously one of the best chicken dish I've ever had. The restaurant was generous to serve 3 big chunks of chicken meat. You can eat it with 2 different sauces plus roasted almonds to add variety to your taste, or spoon some couscous into the stew to add more texture. It was a little salty towards the end, but I still finished the whole thing even I was on diet (hahaha)!  As to the dessert, I definitely recommend their famous (our server said so) Chocolate Pot de Creme, which is a cup of chocolate mousse with vanilla cream on top. The mousse was so smooth, rich in chocolate flavor, and not overly sweet. It also came with a small piece of hazelnut crunch bar that went perfectly with the mousse - creamy, crunchy, and very hazelnut-ty. The Strawberry Vacherin was fine as the strawberry sorbet was refreshing. But it has meringue in it, which I don't like at all.  This is by far my favorite Restaurant Week meal. Fulfilling portion, great taste, and lovely service. Oh their complementary bread was delicious, too, and came with 3 types of olive oil from 3 different places. In a word, highly recommend it and actually thinking of going there for regular menu.P.S. Their AC was broken due to construction; I felt very hot the entire night and was sweating after I started my main course.",0,0,0,Jingqiao H.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",175,184,3014

Ended up staying way past closing -- we didn't know, especially because the servers continued to be attentive and didn't make us feel rushed at all. Really kind service. The food was so delicious! I got to try 3 different crostini, the salmon entree, the chicken dish, gazpacho and burrata. Ordered the cheese plate too. I thought everything burst with flavor and had great mouth feel. The desserts were fantastic! One bite of the strawberry dessert and I was hooked. The chocolate pot was so rich too. The restaurant week menu is a great deal.

I had a bottle of Californian Cabernet and it was delicious. I also wanted to have a healthy meal so I decided on the Fig & Olive Salad minus the apples.

1.0,7/14/2017,"Upon arriving at the hostess stand, my two friends and I informed the host that we wanted to sit at the bar for happy hour. Since the bar was full, we were directed to sit caddy corner to the rest of the bar crowd (this should have been our first sign). Then, we were handed dinner + wine/cocktail menus and we again informed the server that we were there for Happy Hour and wanted to see that menu. They then proceeded to tell us that we could not get that menu because the corner we were seated in. was for dinner seating. After going back and forth for several minutes with 2-3 employees, we were informed that because happy hour ended at 6 pm, we couldn't partake. They wasted our time and would not accommodate us even though we were told by the host in the beginning it would be fine to sit in the area we were brought to. Had we been seated and waited on per usual, we easily had enough time to order drinks and appetizers. As frequent visitors (like we are regulars, scrubs & business attire alike!) of this restaurant, this was a big disappointment. We work next door and have come for happy hour on numerous occasions (not to mention sat in the VERY SAME SPOTS we were given today without any issue.) Customer service should always be the number one priority, and given that you lost out on that with us today, it is apparent that is not the case here. We have referred many of our patients to dine here with nothing but the highest praise. It's unfortunate that they were dismissive of us in this manner.

1.0,7/8/2017,"Really awful service. That's why I'm giving this location such a low rating. We came here after work on Friday 7/7/17 between 5-5:30pm. Walked in (Latina?) hostess with long curly hair did not greet us, just looked at us like we weren't welcome or in the wrong place. We said we were there for happy hour. Since there was no space at the bar the hostess sat us at the seating area across from the bar. Our server (also Latin) also did not greet us and just looked at us like we were in the wrong place. He took our order, we ordered from the happy hour menu and I ordered an entree from the regular menu. First, our server did not bring us bread for the table. We had to ask for it after we saw the woman sitting next to us had bread. We also noticed he greeted the woman next to us and asked how she was doing before taking her order. Not a huge deal but he's very inconsistent with his customer service. Second, he never once came back to ask how everything was. Again, poor customer service. It wasn't that busy. We also noticed he asked the woman next to us if she wanted desert and gave her a menu with a smile, he just threw our check on the table without asking us if we wanted desert. After discussing this with the woman next to us, she encouraged us to speak up and say something. So I asked him why he didn't ask us if we wanted a desert menu but he offered it to another customer. He claims he didn't want to be pushy but it's usually good customer service to at least ask because we did actually want desert. He also brought us the wrong check. I told him he has really poor customer service skills. We asked to speak to a manager after our poor experience here and he came over and we explained our experience and he was very nice and apologized on behalf of the server and offered us a free desert. The manager was very professional and seems to have much better customer service than the hostess and our server. We have been to the Fig and Olive in the meatpacking district and had the exact opposite experience. Amazing customer service there! Wonder why it's so different at this location? Needless to say we will never be back to this location. Maybe if they get a new hostess and if we have a different server.",2,0,0,Dana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,83,18

Or more vegetables?? Something ?? The menu said there was squash and Brussel sprouts on the salad... either they forgot or they were non existent look at my pictures.

In midtown, this restaurant rubs shoulders with some of the nicest in Manhattan. My server was attentive and helpful recommending things on the menu. The meal began with bread and a sampling of three different olive oils, a nice welcome plate. I then ordered the prosciutto, Gorgonzola, and shrimp/avocado crostinis. All three were upsettingly average--not bad--just average. I felt I didn't need to come to this restaurant for shrimp that felt like it had been sitting out on top of some avocado purée that wasn't very fresh. My main dish was the salmon. I really did enjoy this dish much more than the crostini, but for the price it didn't feel like something I couldn't have gotten somewhere else.

4.0,6/26/2017,"I know there are literally millions of great restaurant options in NYC, but that didn't stop my friend and I from ending up here 3 times over the course of our long girls' weekend in the city. Granted, we were staying at the Omni 500 feet away, so convenience was a factor. Nevertheless, the food was consistently great, waitstaff efficient and friendly, and drinks beautifully assembled and Strong. I'm a huge fan of Manhattans for a cocktail, and the F&O's Manhattan Sour was literally the best take on this drink I've ever had. It had just the right balance of tartness/fruit with the bitterness and full flavor you'd expect from a Manhattan. Definitely worth the 13 dollar price tag. My friend was really impressed prosciutto and fig tartlet (Veg here so I didn't have any, but it was very pretty and hearty enough for a main course, apparently.) I'm a sucker for salad with any meal, and the butter lettuce salad was a nice light accompaniment dish. My only complaint on this one was that there could have been more volume and variety. Adding enough leaves to really fill the bowl and maybe some onions or veggies other than tomatoes would cost the restaurant next to nothing and would really fill out the dish. The Tuscan Artichoke dish was exceptionally flavorful, though I wished for more of the fancy mushrooms they were stuffed with, and the mushroom side dish was also delicious and a very ample serving. (Huge mushroom fan, if you can't tell.) The zucchini appetizer was delicate and enjoyable, though I think a bit more seasoning would have helped it. Crostini was ok, but dominated by the bread and cheese elements rather than whatever featured ingredient was.Fig and Olive DEFINITELY worth a stop if you're in neighborhood and looking for a (relatively) reasonably priced, high quality meal in a relaxed, chic setting.

The linguine was a little too al dente for my taste, seemed a little undercooked. Scallops were delicious but they were very small.

4.0,2/8/2017,"Pricey, but everything we ordered tasted really good. We went for the prix fixe restaurant week dinner menu and delighted ourselves with butternut squash & chestnut soup, truffle mushroom croquettes, fig & olive tajine, moulard magret duck breast, and chocolate pot de creme. I have to say the truffles croquettes is the highlight of our meal, crunchy outside and tender and flavourful inside. The tajine's chicken was done very well, not too dry and neither salty nor tasteless, though the sauce itself was rather salty. The duck was excellent, though being a big eater, I found the 2 slices wanting for quantity.The place was decorated nicely with the right amount of lighting. While the candlelight at the table gave off a classy romantic feel,  the noise level of the patrons' chatter was not. Perhaps on a less busy night it would be more suitable for quiet conversations.The service was good (thankfully we made reservations so we didn't have to wait longer than the 2 minutes they took to settle us in).

2.0,2/4/2017,"I'll never understand why people who have no customer service skills get into jobs where they have to deal with the public. My problem was not the food, it was my waiter. I went here recently with a few friends for restaurant week. From the get go, our waiter could not be bothered. My friend was asking him questions about the menu, like what dishes he recommended, etc. and he told her, well it seems like you still need some time, and walked away without answering. When he finally decided to come back, we of course still had a few questions. I am exploring a vegetarian diet, so I asked if a certain dish could be made without meat, and he did everything short of roll his eyes at me. I get it was potentially a silly question, but a simple no would have sufficed, instead of the judgmental response I got. All of that can somewhat be forgotten though. And it almost was given how good the food was. BUT, I found a HAIR in my soup. This has never happened to me before but I knew I had to bring it to my waiter's attention. When I did, he has the audacity to ask why I finished the soup! I had to explain that the hair did not become evident to me until I had reached nearly the bottom of the bowl. Obviously, had I discovered it sooner, I would not have eaten as much! He then begrudgingly offered me another one which I declined. I asked if instead I could have another drink and he contemplated this and walked away without answering. He did bring another round of drinks but I had no idea that it was comped until I checked the bill. He had just basically ignored my request and never actually answered me. Here's a tip to the management and waitstaff: if a patron discovers a hair in their soup, do not treat them as if they put the hair there. My waiter did not apologize and instead treated the situation as if it were my fault. I can't even believe this has to be said.I will be back, because the food was delicious (other than the hair soup), but maybe to a different location.",3,1,0,Sahara S.,"Bronx, NY",81,25,11

Weird that we didn't get the crostini sampler even though it was part of the RW menu. But I had the croquettes as the app. Surprisingly they gave a lot. You prob get around 6-7 mini croquettes that are really rich in flavor and yummy. From there I ordered the paella as part of the entree. Not the best paella I've had but it was good tasting. You get a good amount of seafood as well as seafood to rice ratio. For dessert, I had the chocolate creme which is kinda like a chocolate pudding but lighter.

Although they were tasty and ingredients fresh, definitely not satisfying.Then we had cooked salmon, figuring we'd share the $24 dish, but it was hardly enough for one person! Wine, $12 a glass.

4.0,1/25/2017,"Came here for restaurant week lunch and was not disappointed. The food and service were exceptional, and I think it's worth coming here for lunch if you were thinking about it (make a reservation though, this place is packed during lunch hours).The meal comes with an olive oil tasting with their home made bread. There's 3 different types of olive oil and the waiter explained the difference, but they were all kinda whatever. The bread tho (omg) was so good.We chose the crostini tasting which was an add-on for 3 dollars, and we got the mushroom, burrata, and onion. My favorite was the burrata. The onion was a bit too sweet for my liking.We chose the truffle mushroom croquettes and the salmon crudo for our appetizers, and they were both great. The croquettes were nice and crispy, and the mushroom filling was good, and the parmesan and truffle on top were amazing. The salmon had a nice mix of flavors; the saltiness from the sauce, the sourness of pomegranate, and the bitterness from the grapefruit. If you choose to go, I would just stick with one order of the croquettes because it is very filling and the truffle is strong.For the main courses we chose the paella with scallops ($6 supplement) and the squash risotto with shrimps ($8 supplement). Both dishes are beautifully plated, especially the paella. We added on 2 scallops (yes only two ) for $6 but I think it was worth it. The scallops were so fresh and perfectly seared. The rice was a but creamier than I expected (different than the paella I've had in Spain) but still good nonetheless. They were generous with the rest of the seafood. The risotto was disappointing, because I thought the granules of rice were too soft and a bit over cooked. I prefer my risottos al dente for the extra bite, but this had the texture of porridge almost. I added on 5 shrimps for a $8 supplement. The shrimps were nicely seared, but not a must try at $8. The kabocha was sweet and very tender which was nice. I would say this is a pass and try something else maybe. The portion for the paella is enormous, and is definitely something you can share. While the risotto portion wasn't enormous, it was extremely filling because of the creaminess from the starch and cheese.For the desserts, we chose the chocolate pot de creme and the dessert crostinis. We did not care for either because they were extremely sweet and one dimensional in flavor. The crostini itself was quite nice. The pot de creme was literally a cute pot of chocolate with cream on top (I personally find it gross but everyone has their tastes). If I come back during non restaurant week I'll skip the desserts.In total, our food itself came out to $80 ($29x2 for restaurant week course + $8 crostini + $6 scallops + $8 shrimps). I think it's hilarious how every time I go out for restaurant week it's never just $27/$42. All in all this is a great restaurant and I highly recommend you come here during restaurant week to get a feel for the food they serve here.

It had that casual yet classy vibe and I absolutely loved how the wall was decorated with truffle (?) oil bottles. The brunch cocktails were pretty creative and delicious. My friend got the sangria which came in a wine glass and looked bright and refreshing. I got the Summer in Provence which was a delicious blend of blackberries, gin and herbs. You couldn't really taste the alcohol, which I personally prefer but it was still pretty strong. It was fruity and bright! The food was good as well. Nothing spectacular but I have seen some places botch up eggs which can be pretty hard to do. The poached eggs went well with the tartar sauce,  salmon and toast.

We also ordered the two soups they had available which were carrot ginger & butternut squash. They were both amazing but if I had to choose I would go with the butternut squash. Now we decided to try the crostinis & opted for the option of 3 because we weren't sure if we would like them. I have to say that was our only regret in this meal because now i can say always order SIX! They are perfection. The flavors all go together so perfectly & the bread is the perfect texture. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a light delicious lunch the only con I can think of is that it is a little pricey & small portions but we weren't looking to eat alot so wasn't a problem for us.",0,0,1,Samantha P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",421,101,223

1.0,10/8/2016,I am a huge fan of this place. I go there as often as I can. But unfortunately the popularity of this place has massively comprised its service. Firstly i had asked to be seated in the upper level when I made the reservation. My guest had arrived earlier than me and was seated in a horrible spot on the lower level. then we had to wait for several minutes for them to bring the bread and the olive oil. Then we had to chase down the waiter for five minutes to order. The order came late and my soup was barely room temperature. I  did not bother to send it back because we were did not want to go through the hassle all over again. and my quinoa salad entree was too salty. The poor busboys were working like crazy to clean up so they can churn the tables as fast as possible. This place has lost its touch. the service is mechanical and poor and the food is not as good as it used to be and the noise level is unbearable. not going back again,0,0,0,afsaneh n.,"New York, NY",0,29,0

I've responded that if they can't make a poached egg then maybe i should skip it altogether. She said they'll try. The eggs came back perfectly poached the second time.Overall the food, hiccups notwithstanding, was decent. The service, however, was bizarre and borderline rude.

Next time I would pass on the zucchini carpaccio, but the marinated olives were tasty, and even the bread and olive oil were amazing. The side of sauteed spinach with fig was also different and delicious.

Something seemed off right from the start.The crostini we ordered seemed to be made on rectangular pieces of soggy store bought sliced bread. Not the crisp baguette slices I remember it being made on. The toppings too were a bit less and lacking in flavor.For the mains, I ordered the F&O burger medium, with Swiss cheese. What I got was an overdone burger with a smelly, plasticky, oily glop of cheese on top of it. I asked the waiter to check if it was okay and I was met with haughty condescension and a quip about what ""good"" cheese should smell like. The truffle pasta that most of our table ordered was bad as well. Inconsistently cooked, and one of us got cold pasta. The plates were warmer than the food itself. Rumors of them serving microwaved food are almost starting to be substantiated!Late in the meal (and coincidentally after I posted a picture on yelp), I was offered a free dessert, the cocoa pot of creme which was really good.

5.0,5/30/2016,"I spent a long weekend in NYC, and even with the great selection of restaurants the city has to offer, I ate here twice.  The crostinis are amazing, with the standouts being the burrata and the mushroom and truffle; the mushroom truffle croquettes are also delicious (little fried balls filled with mushroom and a fairly strong truffle flavor, on a bed of olive oil aioli). The penne pasta was a little underdone, but I was so full by that point of the meal that I wasn't too disappointed.  They have great meat, cheese, and olive charcuterie selections, and it was a nice touch when the waiter brought us out a dessert on the house (the chocolate pot of crème, with a praline wafer). You could actually make a great meal out of just appetizers and crostinis here.",0,0,0,Taylor L.,"McKinney, TX",0,26,0
4.0,5/27/2016,"Came here around 3:55 p.m on a Friday because Nerai, greek restaurant a few blocks away,  only served appetizers during this time. Luckily, we came here before 4 p.m because Fig & Olive was about to close its kitchen as well. Beautiful and bright interior! Was not a big fan of their bread, but it's free so I won't complain. Service was not superb but got my water filled like 3-4 times. Thankfully for the cold water or else, I would be sweating bullets. It was so warm inside; they should certainly pay attention to the weather outside and adjust the AC. Going to the food, I love love love the mushroom truffle croquette- fried batter crunchiness on the outside and creamy truffle with bits of mushrooms on the inside. Fight for it and eat it while it is hot! Do not save it for later as the fried exterior will not be as crunchy. I ordered the mushroom truffle oil pasta; the portion can be for 2 people!

4.0,5/25/2016,"Came here for my sister's graduation dinner! We had a reservation for 9pm on Monday and it was still decently busy even then. We got seated at a nice big table upstairs. I loved how nicely decorated the restaurant is!To start, we got the beef carpaccio and the choice of 6 bruschetta. Both were really tasty but I thought the size of the bruschetta was rather small for the price. We also ate the free bread and olive oil - the oil was so good! They give you three kinds of oil and you can actually taste and compare the subtle differences which was fun.For my main course I got the pasta primavera with salmon. Unlike the appetizers, the main course portions are generous. My bowl of pasta was huge and had a nice big piece of salmon in it. Super tasty, creamy, and full of veggies.My sister got the branzino, which came with 3 pieces and mashed potatoes. I tried it and thought it was just okay - really lacking in flavor compared to my dish.I also tried my dad's sea bass, which I thought was really good. It's unique how they put pieces of orange and grapefruit with the fish.Overall I really enjoyed my experience at fig and olive, and I think it's a great place for a special occasion.

I ordered the truffle mushroom croquettes. They were at first crispy, but the taste of truffle was overwhelming. People don't realize that truffle is meant to lightly drizzle- no to bath the food in it. We shared the crab salad, which we all thought it was phenomenal. The decor and ambient was chick and acceptable for Lexington avenue, but i preferred their Fig and Olive in the Meatpacking district. Please aware of the menu change in the afternoon. We sat down for lunch at 3, but by the time we ordered our food the menu had changed to dinner, so the prices almost double.

3.0,3/16/2016,"Overdue restaurant week review.Started with a fig & olive salad. Big portion. I wish they had fresh figs in there instead of the cured/candied (not sure what's the proper name) figs, but I guess it's not really fresh fig season. Also opted for the crostini tasting. Our table shared 6 crostini, and they were all very good. The fig one was sweet, more like a dessert crostini, but all the other ones were fresh and paired well. Unfortunately, entree was below par. I had the branzino. Didn't like how it was served - it was cut into three pieces served on a long dish. Fish was not really seasoned, a bit dry, not much flavor. Mash potatoes was pretty bad. Very blend and doesn't have a good texture to it. I didn't even eat it. I tried someone else's tajine, the flavor was good and it was a big portion, but the chicken was dry. I had the chestnut mousse for dessert. Funny they emphasize the chestnut mousse as the star of the dish, because it's more like a faintly chestnut flavored whip cream that's on top of a very tasty berry sorbet.Probably wouldn't come back unless it was just for drinks and crostini.",1,0,0,Joy J.,"New York, NY",52,41,32

4.0,2/21/2016,"Came during restaurant week. The RW menu didn't interest all of us. My cousin gave it a try. The rest of us  ordered off the regular one. Beautiful ambience. We were seated upstairs which was pretty cramped. I was a little annoyed about being seated right next to the open kitchen. But it was exciting watching all the magic happen. Our server Venus was pleasant. She was patient as we were indecisive and asked tons of questions. She didn't check back as much as we would've liked. But it was very busy so we didn't hold it against her. She also sent us complimentary dessert. The Grand Marnier Framboise Peche Sidecar was easily one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I mean great amount of booze, well balanced and tasty. We all had two.  @ $16 bucks a pop I had to practice restraint, but I could've easily had more. They give bread with three different olive oils. The oils were very good. Each having a distinct flavor and layer of depth. The bread was an after thought. It was dry and would've benefitted from being warmed a little.We had 3 crostini. Shrimp, avocado & cilantro. Prosciutto,ricotta, fig & olive. Goat cheese caramelized onion & chive.  The prosciutto one was the best. Layers upon layers of flavor within each bite. Lots of texture and so satisfying. The goat cheese one was simple yet very tasty. The shrimp one was on the bland side and not nearly as interesting or good as the other two. The truffle mushroom croquettes were phenomenal . I mean they literally were gone within 5 minutes. Crispy outside, creamy cheesy inside with tons of truffle flavor. I'd come back just for those. The fig Gorgonzola tartlet was divine. It was a big portion. Each bite just kept giving you more. Salty, sweet, acidic, crunchy, creamy it hit all flavor & texture notes. Very thoughtful dish. Since it was on puff pastry it wasn't heavy.Sea scallops were delicious. Perfect sear on them, good size, fresh and well seasoned. The cauliflower purée was yummy. The slithered almonds added a nice crunch and nuttiness to the dish. The paella was okay. All the seafood  was perfectly cooked and the dish was seasoned well. However it lacked something and was a little on the greasy side. I've honestly had better. The lamb chops were great. Cooked to a perfect medium rare like requested. The eggplant was so delicious and well prepared. The natural sweetness of the vegetable really shined through and I loved the texture. They treated it like a piece of meat. Best eggplant I ever had. The gnocchi was pillowy soft and delicious. Very thoughtful dish, would definitely come back for this. The olive oil mashed potatoes were yummy. Texture was perfect and very well seasoned. Full of olive oil flavor but not greasy. The caramelized apple tart was decent. A little to sweet for my liking. I liked that the apples still had some crispness to them. But crispin apples tend to be naturally sweet, the dish could've benefited from a tarter Apple like Baldwin. I didn't like the chocolate fondant. It was completely cooked through, so not really a chocolate lava cake. I wasn't a big fan of the texture or the flavor. For RW my cousin got the fig and olive salad for appetizer. She loved it. She said it was well balanced and packed a flavor punch.She got the fig and olive tajine for entree. She didn't enjoy the dish. I was too stuffed to try it. So I can't say whether it was a poorly made dish or she just didn't like the spices. (Side note our server overheard my cousin saying she disliked the dish and she sent the manager over. Manager was very nice and offered to get my cousin something else and remove the RW my cousin declined. Nice gesture and very much appreciated)For dessert she got pot de crème. She thought it was okay. I thought it was smooth, creamy, chocolatey deliciousness. I'm not a pudding fan. But this was yum.

I got the Butternut Squash & Chestnut Soup while my coworker had the Truffle Mushroom Croquette. There's nothing special about the soup.. your typical pre-made, heated on order soup but the Truffle Mushroom Croquette was really delicious!! It wasn't overly fried, the texture was just right and the creamy wasn't too creamy as well! If I do return to dine at this place, that's definitely one appetizer I'll be sure to order again.For our main course, I got the Paella Del Mar while my coworker got the Grilled Thyme Chicken Paillaro. I don't think this is extraordinary good or anything.. it just tastes alright (and to be frank, pre-made). I felt the Grilled Thyme Chicken Paillaro was a little dry and could use a bit more moisture and flavor as well. The salad wasn't extremely good but nothing that stood out on my palettes. The Paella Del Mar was slightly better with Tiger shrimps, Squid, clams, rice  but again, it felt like a meal I got from my Lean Cuisine. The dessert wasn't extremely good either.

4.0,1/18/2016,"I stopped by Fig and Olive today to kick off Restaurant Week. I had high expectations from hearing about it from so many of my friends, I figured why not make use of the deal and check it out now. I walked in and was directed upstairs for our table. We were quickly seated at some tables that are just a little too close together. We were seated between two other groups, and as they each left, both groups had to shift the tables to make room to exit. Other than that slightly awkward table arrangement, the restaurant is beautiful. There was tons of natural light streaming in from the large window overlooking 52nd St, and the whole ambiance was really classy. On to the important part - the food. I have to say the Truffle Mushroom Croquette stood out the most to me. Everything else was good (between my friend and I, we also tried the butternut squash and chestnut soup, the paella del mar, grilled thyme chicken paillard, the crostini, and the chocolate pot de creme), but that was probably my favorite. I think the best part of our experience was Stephon, who saw us contemplating whether or not to get a cocktail (we ultimately decided against it), and then came back and gave us some cocktails anyways! His attention and service is probably the main reason I might return. Food was solid, service was great. Well worth the money.",0,0,0,Jen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,32,25
2.0,1/18/2016,"After hearing this was a must hit dinner spot we made reservations with expectations of a stellar meal. The ambiance and decor is absolutely stunning. Everything you'd imagine a NY dinner spot to look like. Unfortunately, the food was so-so. My boss and I each ordered a glass of the prosecco and I have never seen a glass of bubbles have not one single bubble. With one sip, it was clear this pour was flat. So with that we sent them back. So, the experience did not start on a positive note. I will say the appetizer tapas are a delight. The beef carpaccio was on top of a warm, freshly baked pastry. We also tried three tarts- a fig, an apple, and fennel. These were a treat! The fig is a must try. For dinner, I had the paella. It was definitely not the best I've ever had. So much so that I did not take the leftovers with me and I always take my leftovers! At this point it was hit and miss on items. We ended our meals with an order of limoncello. I have had my share of limoncello in the states and abroad and I have never had it served warm like they did here. After one sip, 2 of the 3 drinks sat there unfinished.

1.0,1/11/2016,"Just ordered lunch from here today and was very disappointed.  I ordered the lunch special that comes with the squash soup, roasted chicken and biscotti $27.  First off, I did not receive the biscotti.  Normally I would not be upset but when you are spending almost $30 for lunch, I expect to get everything I pay for.  The soup was a much more watery/oily consistency than I was expecting, and I didn't love the flavor, but it was piping hot which was nice.  The chicken was cooked very nicely, but I think they may have burnt the seasoning as the flavor was very off. I had to take the skin off to get rid of the terrible flavor.  The ""ratatouille"" was inedible.  It tasted awful and was certainly not a ratatouille.  The fingerling potatoes were so overcooked and shriveled, they were also inedible.  I hadn't ordered from here in a long time and couldn't remember why since the menu sounds so delicious, but now I remember.  A terrible waste of money and I'm still hungry.",0,0,0,Mk W.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",0,12,9

I really like that their kitchen is open all day long. I get off work early and it's not always easy to find good restaurants that serves early dinner. I ordered 3 vegetable dishes:I was delighted to find non alcoholic drinks on their menu. I had the cherry juice which is purely made of 100% cherry (jus griotte) without any added ingredient. It's more like a tangy cherry nectar.Carrot & Brussels Sprout: carrot confit in olive oil, cumin, orange juice, cilantro, spanish onion, charmoula, dry apricot, harissa. The carrots are tender, the brussels sprouts aren't cook so they are crispy. The dressing was really good with a touch of spiciness.Confit Heirloom Potato: hot small potatoes. I like that they didn't add oil in it.Roasted Beet with Caramelized Onion & Almond: the warm beets are good, and the caramelized onions were really sweet. That was delicious.The vegetables dishes are good for sharing. I ate everything and had no more room for dessert. The decor of the restaurant is nice and bright, before 5 pm, they dim the light and it feels warmer.

My girls unfortunately were running late, but I appreciated the fact that the host seated me even though my party wasn't present in its entirety. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu, and service was fast. The three of us girls ordered three different entrees to share anticipating small plates of food, but the portions were surprisingly large and we probably could have gotten away with sharing two dishes. We had an herb roasted chicken with ratatouille, a fish with asparagus and artichoke hearts, and a delightful penne pasta with fresh parmesan and mushrooms. Every dish was packed with flavor. The pasta ended up being my favorite; I don't usually like mushrooms, but these were fantastic - salty and seared to perfection.

Being Nyers, we are used to spending this much going out in the city for a meal, just not for bland mediocre food.  The food wasn't terrible, it just missed flavor.  From the looks of the menu a lot of choices looked promising but fell way short in taste.  The best part of the meal, as one other poster mentioned was the truffle croquettes.  While somewhat greasy they are definitely flavorful.  But sadly that was the only part of the meal that was.  Everything else was a disappointment.  Service also was only ok.  The waitress was nice, just not that interested.  Never really came over to ask how the meal was but did ask if we needed anything else and came over to bus the table along with the bus boy when we were finished.  I didn't realize this was a chain restaurant until I went to post this review.  I would say it makes sense as the food is somewhat standard as to what you can expect from a chain restaurant but prices are not.  So many wonderful choices in the city, from cheap to extremely expensive.  Don't bother eating at just ok places.  You can find a stellar place on any budget.  All in all Fig and Olive is not a place we will be going back to.",0,0,0,Angelica R.,"New City, NY",4,4,0

The paella was definitely yummy, but I think if I got the lamb chops I would be a super happy camper right about now :3 I decided to try the chestnut mousse because our waiter was raving about it and because it was a seasonal dessert, and it was very different! The chestnut mousse was nutty and light, while the cherry sorbet and cherry coulis gave that tangy kick; it was a very unique combination and not one that I would've thought of for a dessert, but nonetheless it's always good to try everything once!The service was really great and our waiter was very attentive.

Although we were a little late we were allowed in. The staff were extremely friendly and good looking people with a wonderful accent that represented the place.Now for the service, we sat next to the  area where they dispense the bread and olive oil. We had some time to choose our food and were immediately given water and asked if we wanted drinks. After that it took awhile to flag our waiter down to get our orders ready. When we finally ordered our food  and got our bread and olive oil, we had to wait a long time, almost 40 minutes to get our food. There was just one waiter working on our side but the place wasn't too big that it should have taken so long. The bread came with 3 different olive oil, all described beautifully by our waiter although it was very difficult to understand. One oil was a bit spicy, one citrus-like and another I forgot what it tasted like. My appetizer was a truffle mushroom croquette. It tasted delicious and I really do love truffles. I even used the bread the get the sauce. My husband got a F&G olive salad, it wasn't anything special but the dressing and olives were delicious however I didn't like the cheese.For our entree I got a F&O Chicken Ta Jine which came with some cous cous. It was extremely saucy. I end up not being able to finish it because the sauce flavor was overwhelming for me. The meat on the chicken was juicy but I didn't love it. The cous cous was very dry and came with some toppings but I didn't know how to eat them together. It was a bit confusing. My husband got the Paella Del Mar which he said was delicious and very filling. I loved the creamy rice that came with that dish. Our dessert was the strawberry crotini and the chocolate mousse. I liked the crotini better because it was not too as sweet as the chocolate mousse however the biscuit was very crumbily and broke apart easily. It took awhile to get our check too after we were able to flag down the waiter. While we were eating though, he did come over twice to ask if we were enjoying our food. Overall it was fun and not bad for my second RW ever. But I felt it could have been better for the money I paid for it.

I liked each single dish we have ordered, towards dessert.Bread with their three choices of olive oil (went from light to medium to heavy) as well as entree - sea bass were two dishes that left me remarkable memories. Bread was soft yet had a smell of fig; fish meat was tender. Cheese cake and chocolate mousse made a perfect ending. It was only Monday night however it was pretty crowded.

The food is very good, but I won't be coming back because the service was terrible. Part of the table received dinner menus instead of brunch menus. It took 10 minutes for someone to serve us water and get a waiter. The drinks came AFTER the food. Water was refilled once. Small things like this kept adding up to create an underwhelming and disappointing afternoon. As for the salad - delightful. It was light and refreshing. The chicken was basic, but cooked pretty well. I don't know what kind of crostinis we got but we had six for the table and everyone loved the one they had (they were all different).

2.0,8/22/2015,"Went here for brunch today on the way to MOMA. First off, as a local, we should have known better than to go to MOMA on a Saturday in August. Second, we should have known that trying to find a good brunch in midtown is a long-shot. Fig & Olive had promise. Omelets, Benedicts, pastries...  but the moment we arrived I could tell it was a bad choice. First, it's one of those places where they segregate people by what they're wearing. Nice cloths you get to be seated upstairs, jeans or casual cloths we'll put you on the first floor in the back, by the kitchen. Then when the waiter arrived at our table he asked if it was our first time there and then launched into his spiel that he does for every table (I heard him do the same one four times). I ordered the french omelet (Fines herbes, asparagus, scallion, goat cheeseserved with Mediterranean fries and mixed greens), my companion got the Poached eggs (on toasted bread, mushroom, gruyere bechamel, sauteed cremini mushroom with onions, prosciutto served with a side of mixed salad). And we ordered the bread basket to start. No bread arrived. And when the mains came the omelet had no trace of cheese. When I asked the waiter asked if, ""I'd like a side of cheese."" I said no, he said he could ask them to make me another. I should have considered that, but I was hungry and no cheese wasn't the end of the world. Half way thru the meal, still no bread. I asked the waiter to call off the bread since we were almost done with our meal. When we were presented with the check the waiter, looked at it and said, ""you weren't charged for the bread."" Thanks, you mean you didn't charge me $9 for something you didn't bring me? Over all the waiter was rude and the food was meh.

We ordered a tarte to share as one of our appetizers among 7 guests. When we asked if the kitchen could cut it, she refused. One of our guests ordered another glass of wine.

The Truffle Mushroom Croquette really impressed me. The truffle flavor was prominent but not overpowering. Sadly, I couldn't say the same about the Fig & Olive Tajine. The chicken didn't stand out in any particular category and I felt like I could have similar quality chicken at any midtown lunch hot bar.

I looove raw salmon and this one was perfect !Then, I had the Paella del Mar which was very good.

However, I couldn't finish it.The service is fast which was something that I wanted as it was a lunch break on a workday. The waitress was friendly.

However, I was in between a wine and cocktail mood that day so I had their red sangria to satisfy both cravings. Our server was fantastic and knowledgeable.

Buy wine by the glass as the bottles are overpriced due to the fact they give about a glass and a half in a small carafe of wine when you order a glass at the bar (I'm not sure about when you are sitting at a table).I only ranked 4 stars because of the price.

5.0,4/29/2015,Fig & Olive was a great experience. I came here for dinner with 7 family members during a wedding weekend in NYC.

3.0,4/28/2015,"Lively place unimaginative food.I must preface my comments with a warning.  I am not a fan of rosemary. It takes over whatever it is prepared with.  It's floral bouquet belongs in a vase and not recipes. My opinion.Okay, why unimaginative?  As far as I could tell, rosemary was used in almost every menu item on a special menu prepared for my large group.  It was in the dry focaccia bread.  It was in the salad and it was in two of the three entrees.  Steering clear of rosemary was not going to be possible. The arugula tart sound interesting but when it arrived, as was the case with most items ordered, what arrived looked entirely different than expected.  This can be a wonderful surprise sometimes. In this case, it was disappointment.  Big fat sprig of rosemary sticking out of the top but easily removed. The ""tart"" was actually a flat pastry pad on which the arugula and prosciutto were placed on. Flavor was good but a different kind of bread base would have worked better. For entree I ordered the tuna which arrived looking over cooked though it was not.  Accompaniments were five lonely small potatoes and an eggplant purée. Finished hungry and looking at the rosemary-infused chicken and steak options across the table. Highlight was the dessert which consisted of two shortbread ""crostinis"" with mascarpone and three (each) black cherries on top.  Lovely.  Service was attentive and pricing was New York competitive.

5.0,4/27/2015,"I have come to this 52nd street location several times for business lunches, both with large groups and small groups, and every time they have been able to efficiently serve us, no matter the group size.  When you arrive, they greet you warmly and are efficient at immediately having you seated and taking your order.  The place is pleasantly bright and airy, so even when it is very crowded, with tables close to each other, you do not feel overwhelmed.  As for the food, I have tried their Maine Lobster Bisque, Paella del Mar, Truffle Risotto and their Penne Funghi Tartufo, all very delicious but the Paella del Mar and the Risotto are outstanding.  However, in my opinion, the portions are astonishingly small (more like appetizer size) for the entrée prices they charge, but these entrees are so rich, that you will feel satisfied.   **Recently, I discovered they have Prix Fixe menus for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner, which include the delicious appetizer and entree choices I mentioned, plus 2 very good options for dessert.  In my opinion, you get fantastic value with the Prix Fixe menus because the portion sizes are not much smaller than those from the regular menu, plus they include 2 courses and dessert for what you would be paying for an entree alone under the regular menu.   Their prix fixe menus really offer much greater value for what you are paying. -Their service is friendly and very efficient.  Also, no matter how crowded the place is, they do not make you feel rushed.  They let you dine at your pace, which is important to me.In summary, I will definitely keep coming back because I always leave here feeling pleased with the great food and service they provide.",1,0,0,I Corona D.,"New Hyde Park, NY",2,27,17

We got there at an odd time, between brunch and dinner, when we could only order from the first page of the dinner menu, so we didn't get to try any of the meals. We had the Crudo Tasting, which is salmon crudo, tuna crudo, and beef tartar, all of which were excellent. We agreed the tuna was the best. We also had an excellent salad and a third dish which was great even though I've forgotten what it was (I've been meaning to write this review for a couple of weeks).Since it was my birthday, they brought this wonderful dessert. I'm not sure what it was; nothing quite like it was on the dessert menu. Something creamy with shortbread on top.While I don't drink much, I was tempted by their intriguing cocktails. I had a Summer in Provence, which was tasty, although I wish I'd gotten my girlfriend's drink (I think it was the Fig and Walnut Julep, but I'm not positive).I wish I could say I was going back to try a full dinner, but I probably won't.

It has great ambiance and great service. I had a red sangria with fruits which I love along with steak tartar and sear ahi tuna. My husband had the same appetizer and seafood boulibasse. The food is spectacular and we didn't get dessert because we were full. I will definitely go back to this place and try other foods on the menu and I will try their wines.

This season, I had joined them for lunch and I decided to try all the new items rather than the usuals that I get. I advised my friends to get my favorite dishes and they really liked the choicesl. Let's just say I enjoyed knowing that they enjoyed it more than the fact that the food in front of me wasn't as great as the theirs. The drinks on the menu were really good, definitely try out their red sangria or the rossellini! Truffle Mushroom Croquette: one of my favorites that's stuffed with cremini musrhoom and drizzled with a truffle olive oil. The Maine Lobster Bisque was a huge disappointment, there was no seafood/lobster taste. It was not creamy and not flavorful. How can a bisque not be creamy and rich? On top of that, it was not hot enough to be called ""soup"". Salmon Crudo - It looked like a salad with a few pieces of raw salmon swimming in olive oil. It didn't taste bad, just nothing special. Truffle Risotto - It was supposed to be really good just as I had it the first time but it wasn't up to par. The risotto was a little too wet. There weren't enough mushroom pieces but too much scallion. Organic Salmon - Surprisingly, it was really good. It's hard to mess up cooking salmon though. The salmon was fresh and tenderly cooked with perfection. The asparagus and cauliflower mash accompanying it was just okay. I wish the salmon was paired with some more flavorful sides. And for dessert, make sure to eat the pot de creme with with a small bite of wafer tasting financiers.

Our reservations were for 7:30PM, and we were finally seated at 8:30PM.  The host working the front door did not seem to be in control of her dining room and it was clear that the restaurant was not prepared for the level of business they'd been presented with that evening.  Waiting for our table would not have been a complete let down had the restaurant had sufficient waiting space and/or bar space.  There were people packed into the ""lobby"" if it cab be called that like sardines.  Their were people seated in the same space trying to enjoy their dinner which seemed impossible with the constant push of the waiting crowd.  Waiting at the bar was not any better, as you were right in the way of food runners and constantly bumped into or just shoved aside. The drinks we got at the bar were pretty tasty, though I was served a glass of wine with a rather sizable piece of cork floating in it.  When we did finally get seated the restaurant tried to make it up to us by having some of their corstini's brought to the table.  They were tasty, but at that point my customers had already noticed the failure and the embarrassment was unavoidable.  Dinner service was not particularly notable, and the server was pleasant enough (but not memorable by any means).  The Fig & Olive Chicken Tajine was tasty, and well presented, but the couscous was served on a separate dish and appeared to be a bit of an afterthought.  Two guests enjoyed the Mediterranean Branzino was was cooked perfectly and beautifully presented.  Overall, Fig and Olive is not a place I am going to rush back to... if you have a large party do not even considered it.",1,0,0,Andrew H.,"Arlington, VA",26,12,0

While the portions are on the smaller end, the taste is definitely not. The richness of the food, the various tastes and textures that come on your plate are plentiful.

First of all, thanks to our server, Elyse, who was absolutely wonderful, attentive & helpful during our meal here. We decided to get the crostini tasting, which was delicious, very flavorful, and each very different. I would definitely recommend getting the crostini tasting. It's a few bucks extra, but worth it. My sis and I decided to get the Maine Lobster Bisque, which she enjoyed, and I got the Mushroom Truffle Croquette, which was simple but appropriately tasty. For our entrees, we got the Paella del Mar, and the Filet Mignon. The Paella del Mar was delicious, topped with calamari rings, shrimp, mussels, and one nice piece of scallop. I love paella in general, well jambalayas and gumbos, so this was great. It was risotto-like, & of course, I love risotto. Anyway, the filet mignon was good too, although I think in hindsight, I should have tried the Chicken Tajine, which is one of their signature dishes. The only reason I say this is because the filet mignon's texture wasn't quite what I was expecting. The dessert was perfect. We got one of each, I forget their names, but both are good. One was a dessert crostini and the other was a chocolate pot de creme (I think). The two went well together. The ambiance and interior design was simple and very pretty.

2.0,2/2/2015,"I work around the block from this Fig & Olive location and was excited to try it out for take out after having been to its meatpacking location and loving it.I called to place an order for ""Provence Roast Chicken"" on a Monday night at 7pm and they quoted me 1 hour. Kinda slow given that it's not even delivery..Anyway, I get home excited to eat my chicken. It's pretty nicely packaged and the chicken size is respectable (see pictures). There's plenty of heirloom potatoes on the side and oh wow! they're cooked pretty well and flavorful. When I started cutting the chicken is when I realized all the sauteed vegetables were underneath and they look extremely unappetizing (a phrase I RARELY say). There must've been zucchini and maybe eggplant in there? but I couldn't tell the difference because everything was brown and drenched in oil from the chicken thighs. Overall very VERY mediocre - there was no depth in flavor and it seemed to be sloppily put together maybe because it was a take-out order. I was unimpressed AND disappointed given that it all looked good in the beginning.I was so excited to try their chicken tajine and paninis as well since I heard good things.. but hesitant to be disappointed again.",4,2,1,Sally L.,"San Francisco, CA",497,395,1195

Service is good as well, although a little bit more attention to the customers wouldn't hurt. But again, this is midtown, a very busy location. Unless it is a hyper upscale place, don't expect a level of attention you get in less crowded places. May require a reservation.

4.0,1/9/2015,"I had dinner at Fig and Olive after a visit to MoMA, and it was lovely. I split the crostini, the Fig and Olive Salad, and the truffle risotto. The crostini was great, but rather expensive for a small order. I really enjoyed the Fig and Olive Salad as well-- but the truffle risotto was a real game-changer. This risotto was phenomenal! It was incredibly rich, which made it perfect to split. I proceeded to have the creme brulee cheesecake for dessert, which I would also highly recommend. It's a small cheesecake but the top has the consistency of creme brulee, served with caramelized pears and a graham cracker crust. The restaurant's ambience is fine, but nothing that really blew me away. Our table was cute, but fairly small. This is a nice place to go if you happen to be near 5th and 52nd, but don't go out of your way to come here-- you can do better at a nice local spot.

We had a mix of salads and soups, and I had the lobster soup. I must say though that my colleagues salad looked and tasted much better then my creamy soup, something I did not expect. Our server was on top of water and refilling the bread and oils for us which was perfect. The food did take a long time to come out. Yes, it was lunch time during the weekday and the restaurant was packed, but we all felt it took a little too long to get the main dishes out of the kitchen. The server even apologized for the wait. The desserts are great as well. I think our complaints were really only related to the food wait and that the place is so extremely loud it was hard to have any sort of conversation amongst us without basically screaming across the table. It led us to just talking to the person next to us, which defeated the purpose of a ""team lunch"".

Soups and appetizers were all great. I prefer Chesapeake Bay crab cakes so these were just okay. We usually don't bother with dessert, but they have a little chocolate pot thing that is unbelievable. Everyone should get one! I'd eat here again on a special occasion. Light Dinner was just under $40 pp. No drinks.

This time I had a girl's night with my cousins and decided to do Restaurant Week here. We get seated into the round table in the middle of the room and our server didn't speak english very well so that already threw me off when I had to try very hard to hear the specials. We placed an order for 12 crostini's and when it arrived we had 12 different sizes. Some were so big it was no longer a crostini, some were so small it looked like they didn't even try. The bread was not even crunchy, it was soggy (it just looked toasted)Finally it was time for our entree's majority of us got the lamb chops. Here is my only issue, how can you know who ordered how you want the meat to be prepared if you just placed it on who ever's plate (I get that on the check you write it based on seating but I ordered Medium Rare and in return received Well Done). Finally dessert comes around and some got the cookies and three of us ordered the Pot de Creme. I hope FIG and OLIVE remembers if we look a certain way it does not mean we don't know our food.

My husband actually took me here the night he proposed and I decided to try it once again for Restaurant Week 2013before I wrote a review.  Just like the last time, it was superb with fairly great service.  We started with the crostinis which were my favorite part of the meal. They were all generous in serving size and most full of flavor that blended well, but the ones with sweetness weren't particularly my favorite.  I absolutely loved the mushroom and artichoke one, which the waiter recommended. For the restaurant week appetizer, I chose the beef tartare. It isn't their usual tartare, which is flat and thinly sliced on the plate. This time, it was more thickly cut and molded into a very thick cube. still delicious and has more blends than the sliced kind.  For the entree, I got the lobster risotto. Never have I seen giant huge claws and tails! Although the risotto portion looks small, it was very filling with generous amounts of lobster. It was worth every penny!Lastly for dessert, I ordered the waffle and berries. Unfortunately this wasn't the best part of the meal.

Nice touch to bring the bread with a variety of different olive oils (Italy, Spain, California).  Appetizers were fine.I ordered the sirloin.  Sirloin tends to be a relatively lean cut of beef.  Somewhat more tough but you sacrifice that for relative value and rather consistently satisfying good flavor.  That's what I expected.Sirloin was inferior to what I'd buy in any supermarket.  I could not believe the amount of fat I cut off, which is totally uncharacteristic for a sirloin steak at any price point. I managed to carve out the edible bites.  At the end I showed the waiter the fat and suggested that the chef understand what he's serving.  I probably should have sent it back but it's not my nature.  He apologized and I accepted.

Penne Funghi Tartufo (Cremini and black trumpet mushroom, parmesan, parsley, scallion, white truffle olive oil) - I don't know what a tartufo is, but mushroom and pasta is a perfect combination.

Good choice if you want a lighter pasta dish.Riviera Salmon (Seared salmon, grilled asparagus, braised endive, cauliflower purée, basil infused olive oil) - I only had a piece of the salmon and asparagus.

4.0,9/4/2014,"Came here during restaurant week with a catch up session with a girlfriend and we had a pretty good experience! the choices were plentiful and lots of seafood choices. We ordered the salmon tartare, truffle mushroom croquette, an order of the crostini for appetizer and the salmon and filet mignon for the entree.Truth be told, i loved the appetizers way more than the entrees. The size of the tartare was HUGE! And it was super fresh with nicely seasoned herbs that complimented the fish. And it came with huge pieces of  toasted bread to smear that deliciousness on. It also came with a side of arugula salad. The croquettes was nicely fried and wasn't too creamy or overpowering of flavors. The crostini's was just okay. I wasn't too amazed by it. The waiter also gave us bread and 3 different olive oils to dip. The oils were preeety interesting. My friend had the first bite and she said the oil straight up taste like grass LOL. Entrees was a bit of a blur. But we were just so busy chatting that i kept on eating it. But i do rememeber the cauliflower puree was really really good. As for dessert, we both got the strawberry crostini as we weren't a big fan of chocolate. It was a pretty light dessert with this amazing blasamic glaze thats sooo good with the strawberry and mascarpone spread.The waiters there are pretty attentive but not too overbearing.

3.0,8/15/2014,"I came here for NYC Restaurant Week with a closed friend and expected a 5-star worthy meal.  I felt that the dishes were not that unique or flavorful and the service itself was quite overwhelming.  The waiters took my plates away the second I finished them and I felt rushed throughout the entire meal.  My water was only refilled once even though I had an empty cup at the corner of the table for most of the time I was there.  Appetizer: Truffle Mushroom Croquettes- this was by far the best dish of the afternoon.  The mushrooms were flavorful and creamy and I loved how they garnished it with REAL truffle slices.  This added an extra umph to the dish and I'd certainly come back for more of these deliciousness!Entree: Paella del mar - more like cheesy, wet risotto-like rice with absolutely no saffron flavors and the tiniest seafoods you can find, all of which are mixed in into a rather small mini wok for you to nibble at.  I found this dish to be very bland and not flavorful.  There was no seasoning to this dish; I couldn't even finish this dish.  Why risk the extra calories?Dessert: Chocolate Pot de Creme - very unique and nice dessert for such a bland meal.  I was confused a bit as to how best to eat this.  Do you mix the vanilla cream with the chocolate pudding/custard at the bottom? Or do you scoop it all up with your spoon? Or do the chocolate-then-vanilla-then-chocolate type of deal?  It was good, but it wasn't as chocolatey or vanilla-y as I would have liked it.All in all, this wasn't the best Restaurant Week restaurants I've dined at.  While it glorifies Mediterranean flavors and cuisines, I felt like it was just an ordinary Spanish or Italian lunch.  The complimentary breads and 3 types of oils they give you weren't that special.  Sure, free may bring a smile to your face but all I tasted was bread.  The oils lack flavor and that nuttiness I craved.  Not the best but not the worst of the worst.",1,0,0,Jessica N.,"Staten Island, NY",146,50,144

4.0,8/13/2014,"Is there anything better than the simplicity of getting bread and olive oil? I'd like every meal in my life going forward to have that as my starter. I went to Fig and Olive for restaurant week but I would love to come back, even just for the crostini alone. The atmosphere inside was beautiful, I felt like I was in a Mediterranean terrace. My partner and I were served three different types of olive oils to try with fluffy rectangular pieces of olive bread for dipping. We ordered three crostinis - fig & prosciutto, crab salad, and truffles mushroom & artichoke. I loved each one. I ordered the Fig and Olive salad, which was quite bountiful, refreshing, and delicious. It reminded me of the fall season. It had olives, halved figs, onions, shaved apples, walnuts, Gorgonzola, tomato, and scallion. My boyfriend got the lobster bisque and that was really good, warm and comforting. Our main course were smoked lamb chops, ricotta gnocchi, and honey roasted eggplant. A glass cover is served over the dish as you watch the smoke dance inside, flavoring everything. When the glass top is removed, you're left with an amazing smokey aroma swimming around your face. The lamb chops were small but tender. The dish was served with Rosemary and garlic infused olive oil on the side which you pour yourself. Depending how much you drizzle, the dish itself was quite oily (but at least it's the good kind?) The gnocchi weren't as ideal as I'd like them to be, and I found the eggplant a little too sweet for my liking as it was honey roasted. But this dish was still quite tasty. The dessert was forgettable. My chocolate pot de creme was served with a very small hazelnut(?) chocolate wafer. The strawberry ""short cake"" was merely a shortbread cracker, served with whipped cream, and a slices of strawberry. It wasn't the perfect meal, but the starter, crostini, salad, and lamb chops alone made me love to come back for more!",2,1,0,Doris T.,"Queens, NY",109,52,34

The Crostinis weren't particularly breathtaking but they were tasty enough for some gabby girls.  I had them suggest some drinks for us and my friends got the rosemary spritzer and I got a virgin mixed blood orange drink which after the first, I loved so much I got two more virgin versions of it.  Our server eventually warmed to us, but I wasn't sure why I had to work so hard at it.  In any case, I don't think he and I will stay friends since only one side wants to work on our issues.

4.0,8/13/2014,"I came for Restaurant Week dinner when Restaurant Week for Summer 2014 first opened and it was overall a very pleasing experience . I was pleasantly surprised.   The food was delicious and the portion sizes were very adequate considering it is their restaurant week pre-fixe menu. That is big for me as most places make their RW portions significantly smaller. They also offer more options in comparison to most of the RW menus that I had browsed. The place has a great vibe plus decor  and would make for a good date spot if you really want to impress your date , it would also be good for a special location. The Fig&Olive salad was perfect ! It was a good portion and the flavors blended so well together. I had the petite filet mignon and they prepared my steak exactly as I ordered it , which is a big plus in my book because most places leave my steak too medium when I ask for medium well. I do wish our server would have been a little friendlier although she provided adequate service.

The crowd was buzzing with activity, and the fun, friendly vibe makes it a great place for group dinners.BF and I ordered the truffle mushroom croquette and salmon tartare as appetizers, and really enjoyed them. The standout was probably the truffle mushroom croquette - although to be honest, it's tough to screw up fried mushrooms drizzled with truffle oil. The salmon tartare was great as well, although the dish featured a little too much dill.The main courses were equally delicious - BF ordered the chicken tagine and I opted for the salmon with mashed cauliflower & baby asparagus. The salmon was amazing, and mashed cauliflower has me convinced that mashed potatoes are a thing of the past ;) BF enjoyed the chicken tagine as well, and really liked the flavors in the sauce it sat in.For dessert, we tried the strawberry crostini and the chocolate pot de creme. True to my chocoholic identity, I LOVED the pot de creme and the little sugar biscuit it came with. The strawberry crostini was delicious as well, although the dish looked a little empty with only two crostinis.All in all, the food was amazing. However, the service left something to be desired. Our waiter took a long time with the food and didn't even provide us the bread/olive oil until after we had finished our appetizers - not blasphemous, but certainly odd since we noticed all the other diners receiving the bread immediately after ordering.

Second course was Rosemary Lamb chops.  Now this was the best course out of the three.  I asked my lamb for medium-well and they were perfect.  Slight pink in the center and still very juicy and great seasoning.  I know people always say .. that's not the right way to enjoy meat, I should either do medium or medium rare.  Well .. the right way is .. to enjoy your meat they way YOU like it.  I don't like to see my meat dripping with bloody juice.  Third course was Crostini (strawberries, mascapone, balsamic, on a shortbread).  It was just average for me.  Nothing memorable.My friend had Melone & Burrata, that appetizer was quite refreshing, but there was just too much burrata.  The entree was seared Yellowfin Tuna A La Provencale.  I didn't really care for this dish (I tried a bite).  I felt like tuna didn't compliment well with tomatoes and olive sauce.  Olive taste overpowered that big piece of seared tuna sadly.I think my experience here overshadowed by the two annoying guests next to us.  If it wasn't as loud as the time I was there, I can see that it can be a nice romantic dinning spot.  And service was attentive.",2,0,0,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454

(If you've never had the misfortune of visiting the Luxor or New York New York, that reference might be lost on you.)Instead, Fig & Olive starts with a simple concept, then executes flawlessly and tastefully. Literally every dish, as far as I could tell, is prepared with fig and/or olive, two staples of Mediterranean cuisine. The walnut and fig julep? Check. Bread for the table served with three different olive oils for dipping? Check. Branzino pan seared in olive oil and served with sliced figs and sugar snap peas? Check, check.In lesser hands, this could get tiresome, but Fig & Olive manages to keep it interesting and inventive. The menu is extremely varied, and I found myself constantly surprised by the chef's multiple uses of two signature ingredients. Everything tasted light and fresh, portions were appropriate, and presentation was attractive. With entrees starting in the mid-20s, we all agreed that our dinner was an excellent value (by Manhattan standards, anyway).Many reviewers have complained about service, but I certainly didn't find it ""terrible"" or ""rude.""

1.0,6/17/2014,"Great food, terrible service.I usually never write (bad) reviews on Yelp. However, my experience there was highly disappointing. I Went there last thursday. We were a group of 8 friends, who made a reservation for a birthday dinner at 8:30. We ended up having 9 people altogether, and showed up at 8:30. They told us we had to wait for another table to get seated since they could not just pull out a chair and sit us, which is pretty normal for this ""high"" quality restaurant. After waiting for about 40 minutes, I kept asking the hostess when we would be seated. An hour later, a bus of 30 people came in and were immediately seated. I could not do anything but notice that we would have had time to eat, and leave the restaurant by the time the bus arrived. We were finally seated at 9:50 at a table for 8 people.I was put in the middle of two tables. The AC was leaking on us so we had to ask the waiters to turn it off. They of course offered us complimentary appetizers and desert, but I do not think that it was enough for the amount we each paid and for the lack of respect they showed us. The manager obviously felt bad for us and gave us his cards in case we wanted to come back. I have worked in the industry for several years and I have never seen something like that.

2.0,6/10/2014,"Fig and Olive is a two storey restaurant.  The bottom floor has a large bar and communal tables in the back.  Upstairs the room looks more upscale with banquet seating on the wall side and individual tables in the middle of the room with real tablecloths and napkins.  My 3 sisters and I had an 8:30 PM reservation for an upstairs table.  This would be a second visit in one week for two of my sisters since they live overseas and recommended this restaurant highly.  We arrived on time and told the receptionist that fact and our request for a table upstairs.  The receptionist said to wait since the table is still occupied.  20 Minutes later we were still waiting and the receptionist assured us that the persons occupying our table are paying the bill.  We waited 10 more minutes and still we were not escorted to our table.  Finally, without explanation, the receptionist said that the table was ready but instead of leading us upstairs, she lead us to the back of the room into one of the crowded communal tables.  We protested and then she said our request for an upstairs table was actually never noted on the reservation.  This still did not excuse her presumptiousness that we would accept whatever crummy table offered to us.  We should have walked out then but decided to give the restaurant another chance.  Five minutes later, the table upstairs mysteriously was avalable.  We sat down and tried to enjoy ourselves and the food.  We started with a dozen oysters @$34.00, mixed olives @$6.00, Jamon Iberico served with pan tomate @ $28.00, and Fig and Olive salad $19.00.  The only free thing offered was bread served with 3 different olive oil.  The oysters were cold and briny served with 3 different mignonette sauces but they were not the traditional mignonette, they are all smooth and the same color.  We could not distinguish one mignonette from another  The Jamon Iberico was freshly sliced and served with triangles of toast with some sort of puree of tomatoes.  The Fig and Olive salad was large and the most interesting of our meal since it has two different kinds of cheeses: Manchego and Gorgonzola Dolce all mixed in with apple, tomatoe, walnut, olive, romaine lettuce, figs and dressed with balsamic vinegar with Arbequina olive oil.The rest of meal was just OK for the price, the lamb chops ($39) were overdone (was ordered medium) but were edible, the fish filet ($29) was a small portion but OK but the most egregious part of our meal was the Filet Mignon served with haricots verts, caramelized shallot.  It is usually served with olive oil chive mashed potatoes but we asked to substitute it with pasta with tomato sauce which the kitchen obliged.  I took a bite of the  tender filet mignon that was cooked as requested, medium rare, I had to spit it out.  It was unhealthily salty that it tasted bitter.  I peeled the outside charred part thinking that I would get rid of the excess salt.  Wrong, the inside was just slightly less salty but still too salty so the whole filet mignon at $42.00 was basically inedible.  We ate the garnishes:the haricots verts and the pasta.  When we complained to the waiter he answered us that we should have complained earlier but I told him to take a look at the plate with uneaten filet, my sister who shared the filet mignon together, both of us could not eat the filet.  She agreed that it was way too salty.  Because we also drank wine, the bill came to several hundred dollars but no discount on the bad fillet or an offer of perhaps a dessert as a consolation price for the inedible food was forthcoming.  A pity. I think the restaurant was too heavy handed with salt, especially if the centerpiece offering were salty olives,  very unhealthy for people with blood pressure or other health problems.  Why can't chefs be light with salt, and leave it to the diners to add salt to their preferred taste.  I think, judging from the youthful population of the dining room, most do not realize that salty food is not only inedible but also not good for one's health.  The salt content of the filet mignon must have exceeded even the threshold of what would be considered healthy level. Mind you, I've eaten in more expensive as well as cheaper restaurants and rarely returned food or complained about food but this filet was inedible.  Most restaurants would offer another food or free dessert but not this one. This is not a cheap restaurant and they should have better customer service as restaurant business is a service business.  Although this was our second visit, we will never go back.I also think, since we were middle aged sisters, not high on the exterior ""cool"" quotients, we were not treated better.  Like books, the restaurant help judged us by our ""covers""  and was totally oblivious that we were sophisticates with fine palates.  We can't be fooled by bad food masquerading as fashionable food.  Our money is as good as that of the cooler diners.  We also paid cash.",0,0,0,Gourmandise F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

Perhaps I don't have a palette for upscale dining, but I'm pretty sure I've had better seared tuna and veal. Crap, even Olive Garden might do a better veal than this place. While everyone was nice and super apologetic about our wait, they desperately need more waitstaff. Oh hey, maybe that's why the table turnover is so slow! Either way, the managers came around a few times to see how things were going, and even threw in free appetizers so I was a pretty happy camper. Or so I thought...While the crostinis were pretty darn good, and that the olive oil tasting was a nice touch, everything else was overcompensated with oils and sauce. Yes, I know... that's how expensive restaurants work and I completely understand that when the sauce is friggin slap yo momma amazing. So much to the point that it perfectly seeps into the crevices of tender meat that was lovingly raised and slaughtered (free range/grass-fed/fair trade, of course). But no.

Moving on to the main...I got the cod with a delish zucchini heirloom tomato side. Made me wish I had a mandoline. She got the penne funghi which I loved as well. Lets talk about the cocktails. Summer in Provence. Pure perfection! Gin, blackberries and rosemary thyme syrup. Friend got the cucumber cosmo which tasted like a trip to the spa with booze. Dessert...chocolate pot de creme that was so light and fluffy. On the house, we also got the dessert crostini which made me a believer of mascarpone and cherries as an epic food pairing. Ended with two glasses of sparkling rose and smiles on our faces. Service was spot on and the ambiance swept me away like I was on vacay.",0,0,0,Brianne K.,"Carlsbad, CA",8,14,1

3.0,4/6/2014,"I recently came back here, not by choice. It was a friend's birthday dinner/girls night out event.  If I had the choice in selecting the venue, believe me, this place wouldn't have been suggested.  However, I am glad that I didn't have a say in the venue, because I truly had a great time here.  The food was much better this time.  We had the CROSTINI (one of each), it looked very elegant and was delicious.  FETTUCCINE SHRIMP MASCARPONE - my friend ordered this. I only had a few bites, but those few bites were so good.  If only I wasn't trying to avoid carbs, I would've scarfed down that son of a beeee when my friend went to the bathroom. :)RIVERIA SALMON - great choice! Salmon cooked just right with the skin being very crispy.  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  OVERALL: my second experience left a better taste in my mouth. I will be recommending this restaurant to others now.  But with fair warning of course. My opinion is that most restaurants don't treat restaurant week customers the same as regular customers.   This was clearly the case here. And it shouldn't be. I received better treatment because I was paying more than $35 for my meal.  This is why I'm deducting stars. Every customer should be treated the same, regardless of which menu they're ordering from.",1,0,0,Jay M.,"Manhattan, NY",18,52,191

The food and drinks were delicious! Service was great as well! Between the two adults in our group, we tried four cocktails: The Cucumber Cosmo and Fig & Walnut Julep were both perfect! The Rossellini and 10 cane Raspberry Mojito were good.We had two types of Crostini (Manchego and Prosciutto), both of which were so good. The Fig & Olive salad was delicious. The truffle risotto was to die for!!! The rosemary lamb chops were perfectly done and very juicy. Chilean sea bass was also delicious. The pumpkin & sage ravioli was the only dish that was average.The desserts were also great. We ordered carmelized apple tart, mixed berry crostata and, on the recommendation of our server, added the raspberry sorbet. He mistakenly brought us a Creme Brûlée Cheesecake and graciously told us to enjoy it while he brought out the apple tart he forgot.

We were able to make the reservation easily and they were quite accommodating when we were running a few minutes late.The décor is quite lovely! It's very charming and rustic, and I loved looking at the many oils on the walls. The bread served with fig and strawberry jam was wonderful! And don't pass up the chocolate croissant - flaky, buttery, and delicious!I ordered the Italian omelet and the table shared a plate of 3 crostini. The omelet was fantastic! The eggs were cooked perfectly and I was so impressed with the quality of the vegetables. They were so fresh and they were not stingy at all with the portion size. I don't recall all the third crostini we tried, but the manchego/almond and goat cheese/caramelized onion crostini were perfect!

I cannot say enough about how good it was. The combination of the paper thin meat and the balsamic was amazing.After starting on such a high note, the rest of the meal felt good but not great. I had a risotto as my entree. It had a variety of sauteed vegetables in it which seemed to be pretty fresh. It was fine but my only complaint is that it had a lot of black pepper in it.

4.0,3/12/2014,"First things first, listen to Nelson W. and order their crostini, that was simply the best advice of going to fig and olive during restaurant week.  The crostini was the best I've had and surprisingly many restaurants do it poorly.  Fig and olive also shines because of course they have awesome olive oil served up with rosemary bread.  For the restaurant week menu, Fig and Olive departs from what many other restaurants do which is offer a special menu that is designed just for restaurant week.  Typically restaurants will feature items that aren't on the menu for this event and it's the typical cheaper items like skate, chicken, and salmon, lame.  Thankfully Fig and Olive actually wants people to try their real menu so the restaurant week menu looked great.To start off we had the crostini (amazing), I had their namesake salad, followed by the paella, and to polish everything off I had the dessert crostini.  The salad was excellent, nicely portioned, and the figs really made that dish.  The paella was on the small side but had a decent portion of seafood that wasn't all filled in with mussels.  It was nicely seasoned, cooked well, and overall a solid dish.  The dessert crostini was nothing to write home about.....really could have just given me shortbread and I would have been just as happy.  Fig and Olive is a nice restaurant with modern decor, a decent amount of space particularly on the second floor, and the perfect place to take a date.  The price is on the higher end for midtown and the service was good throughout.  Although I can't say this was the most amazing meal of my life, I can say going to Fig and Olive would be a solid choice.  The waiter was attentive without being intrusive, the kitchen was fast in getting our food out, and everything was executed well.",0,0,0,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",167,876,249

4.0,3/10/2014,"We arrived right on time for an 8:45 Friday Restaurant Week reservation for 4, and the entrance was PACKED. We couldn't even get to the desk to check in for well over 5 minutes, at which time we were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. A server did go to part of the waiting crowd with what appeared to be champagne, but didn't make it over to us. We waited outside for a few minutes and then came back in to the crush of people, and were seated about 9:15, when the host saw me try to catch his eye a few minutes after checking in with him, and came over to us, asked for my name again, and said we could sit at the first table by the door, which was being prepared. The server was very pushy for us to order the $7 bruschetta, so my fiance finally said yes, since we were starving, though I didn't think they were really worth it. The olive oil trio that came with the bread was very nice, as we appreciate good olive oil, though it came with far too little bread for 4 people, so that we each got only 1 1/2 little cubes of bread, and had nothing to soak up the rest of the olive oil with. The truffled mushroom coquette appetizer was good, though I didn't feel they were amazing, and was slightly disappointed that I didn't try the fig and olive salad, which I had been deciding between and which looked even better. My fiance's crab cake appetizer I tasted was good. For an entree, the lobster risotto was really nothing special, and I don't even think I saw it on the regular menu. The chunks of lobster meat were good, though I felt that the risotto wasn't wowing me, and it was punctuated by whole, cooked baby carrots, which was a little odd. Two of our party paid the $5 extra for the grass-fed steak and raved about it, which I tasted and was excellent. The fourth person got the tuna and was very happy with it. The desserts were excellent, a small pot du creme, very rich and indulgent; and shortbread ""crostini"" with mascarpone and some sort of candied cherries, a somewhat unexpected combination of flavors and textures, but exceedingly rich and delightful. The two who got the steak said they would go back for the normal menu just for the steak.

3.0,3/8/2014,"tl;dr -- Came here for restaurant week, waited an hour for our reservation, drinks were expensive, would have been cheaper to not get restaurant week deal, food was good.I was with a party of three and we arrived a few mins early for our 8:30 reservation, and couldn't get inside the restaurant because of the crowd of people near the entry way. I squeezed in to check in for our reservation, and the woman said she'd be right with us. About 15 mins later, we squeezed into the waiting area and went to get three glasses of wine from the bar for $14 each. Half an hour later, we had finished them. 15 mins after that, we were finally seated. Clearly overbooked for restaurant week.The ambiance was fun, the restaurant was full but not loud -- you could hold a conversation at a normal volume. We ordered our food and drinks pretty quickly (hungry after waiting for so long), and were eventually brought bread with three different types of olive oil, which was a nice touch. For the appetizer, I ordered truffle croquet and my friends ordered the lobster bisque and the salad. Lobster bisque definitely wins, and the salad is wonderful too. The five truffle croquets were each about the size of a nickel and tasted nothing more than fried cheese. Not impressed.We also ordered some crostini, which were actually probably the best part of the meal. They're big enough to split into three portions, so we were all able to sample some. Unfortunately, I cannot remember exactly which ones we had, but you probably cannot go wrong. For the entree, I ordered the seafood paella, while my friends ordered the lobster risotto and the tuna. My paella was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. The seafood didn't taste very fresh and it was salty, but I wolfed it down because my appetizer was not satisfying at all. The lobster risotto was also good but rich and the tuna was cooked well but a small portion. No leftovers for us. We ordered two of the dessert crostinis and the chocolate dish, and the crostinis were actually very good, but very sweet and not filling (good at the end of the meal?). The chocolate was super rich.

2.0,3/3/2014,"Fig & Olive,We ended up here because it was the only restaurant week reservation we could get for a large group on such short notice. Lesson learned. As Groucho Marx said, never join a club that will have you as a member. When it comes to restaurant week, never go to a restaurant that can accommodate a party of 9 on two days notice during restaurant week. First, before I get into the food, let me just talk about the venue because I do actually think it's of note. The walls are lined with bottles of assorted olive oils on both floors, you're literally surrounded by oil on all sides. If there were ever an earthquake or the collective population of manhattan all jumped at once, midtown east would have an olive oil tsunami. Here's what we had:Olive Oil Sample Platter and Bread: As many other yelpers have noted, this is definitely one of the highlights of the night. If you're going to base half of your existence on olive oil, you'd better be damn good at it. The samples that we got were avocado, tomato basil, truffle, and a few other indistinguishable ones. Don't eat the bread they say, it'll fill you up they say. Life is short, and your next meal is never guaranteed. Don't take things for granted and enjoy the bread while it lasts. After they took the bread away, things started going down hill; just like the French revolution.Truffle Croquette: Word on the street was that this was the thing to get off the restaurant week menu so I went ahead and pulled the trigger. Big bowl, little croquettes. The dish came with five croquettes. The filling was less so like a traditional croquettes and more like a cream. Tasted like the fancy pants cousin of the TGIF jalapeno popper. The street lied.Seafood Paella: I was originally going to go with either the filet mignon or the tuna steak, but our waiter convinced me to go with the paella. Probably wanted to get rid of it because nobody wanted it...Tasted like rice-a-roni with finding nemo & friends scattered on top. At least rice-a-roni has a ton of sodium and msg, this was plain jane vanilla bland. Just because you put hamburger helper in a cast-iron pot doesn't make it good. Also, the paella that my friend ordered had a scallop in it while mine did not. We're living in a world of haves and have nots. Cracker and Fake Cherry Dessert: They ran out of the normal dessert which was some sort of chocolate-cake-amalgamation so the options available were their makeshift replacement or vanilla ice cream. Naturally, we all went with the makeshift because getting vanilla ice cream at a restaurant is stupid is as stupid does. It was horrible. Probably should have just gone with the ice cream. Essentially two graham crackers with maraschino-cherries on top. It's times like these where I wish I had a hot tub time machine.

The Chicken Tajine was amazing - truly.  Such a wonderful mix of seasons!  Everything was cooked to perfection!  And did double duty too!  Deserts were the Pot de Creme - awesome, and Desert Crostini.Service was very good.  Of course, the wine my dining mate wanted also wasn't available - but she brought several selections of alternatives for a good match.I can't give it a 5, and 4 might be pushing it - the inconsistencies were glaring but their good nature (and ours), doing the right thing, and wonderful meals - it really was delicious!",0,0,0,cyd s.,"Camden, NJ",2,18,0

I highly recommend the truffle mushroom croquette. It was delicately fried and came with a light bachemel sauce and Parmesan cheese. Absolutely delic! The beef carpaccio was another favorite. Light and refreshing, and we couldn't keep anything on the plate. For the main course we ordered the penne funghi tartufo. Simple, flavorful, and great for mushroom lovers like me. Everything was fresh. My friend had the lamb skewers which were also very flavorful. Yum. Definitely worth a visit. If eat here more if I worked closer.

3.0,2/16/2014,"When your friends suggest going to Fig & Olive for a casual catch-up brunch, you know they fancy. My bf and I arrived and basically were taken aback by how luxe and expensive this place looks, but we did enjoy our meal here.I ordered the F&O burger, which comes with Swiss cheese and a Russian dressing type sauce, along with a tiny salad of arugula, and matchstick fries. While it was very tasty, the bun was a bit crumbly and my burger came well-done instead of medium like I had asked. Others at our table ordered the chicken panini and the mozzarella panini, and they enjoyed their meals as well.  For drinks, I got the cucumber cosmo, which was very good, but a little heavy on the lime, and the bf got the bloody mary, which was the winner. It had real horseradish bite and a nice full flavor.  We also ended up getting dessert for some reason, and ordered the chocolate pot de creme and the creme brulee cheesecake to share. They were tasty, and both were almost comically small for the price tag, which I guess I should have been used to at this point in the meal. In the end, given the high price point and the reasonably good food and attentive service, it averages out to 3 stars.

But despite that, I'm still giving 4 stars bc I've been to this location multiple times and that has never happened before and the food made the wait worth itAll of the crostinis were tasty. I love cheese so my favorites were all of the ones that had cheese. This was my third visit to this location and seventh visit to fig and olive in general. I always get the beef carpaccio. To die for. Had the penne and lamb for the entree. So good! I wish there was more lamb to eat when I was finished. Creme brûlée cheesecake was so good. Forgot I was eating cheese cake. Apple tart was the best. Can't explain why, just try it!Overall I absolutely love fig and olive. I go there every year for my birthday.

3.0,2/7/2014,"Fig and Olive was a pretty cool atmosphere. Location seemed perfect for a business lunch or dinner. I had a few complaints with the layout and menu but overall the experience was enjoyable. The restaurant has a long bar at the entrance, however, it is for seated guests only, and when full, there is nowhere for people waiting on tables to stand and get a drink. This caused the entryway to get jammed. We sat right away and the service was great. I decided to order the fig and olive salad and the fig and olive chicken tajine, which both happened to be on the prix fixe menu. What I didn't know is that the dishes off the prix fixe menu are noticeably smaller than if you order them off the full menu. The salad was standard, the figs made it very sweet and the large brick of gorgonzola cheese they added was overkill. The chicken tajine was very tasty, the chicken was soft and fell off the bone as if it were soaked in chicken noodle soup. The side of couscous was pretty plain and could've been integrated into the dish somehow. Overall though, very good, just a little small off the prix fixe menu. Two of my friends split the whole branzino for two, which was filleted and served table side. It was delicious. Definitely the signature dish of the restaurant and highly recommend getting it. Another one of my friends got the paella del mar, it was tasty but not what you would expect out of paella. The rice seemed more like a thick risotto, very creamy, but good. If it were a hint spicier it would've been significantly better. The dessert off the prix fixe was either a Dessert ""Crostini"" or Chocolate Pot De Creme. We got both and I unfortunately only got to try mine, the Chocolate Pot De Creme. It was delicious, but i expected the mousse to be lighter, it was a bit on the puddy side. Overall, the meal was good. nothing spectacular besides the branzino which I made the mistake of not ordering but got to try anyway. Definitely not a place to come if you plan on getting drinks at the bar before. Come with a reservation, sit down, and eat. Don't order the prix fix if your hungry, portions were small and when you do the math its not much cheaper.",0,0,0,Aaron A.,"New York, NY",0,24,0

We'd made reservations ahead of time so when we arrived, we were promptly seated.My friend ordered the summer in provence cocktail and I had the pear blanche.

We got the eggplant one, the goat cheese and fig one, and the prosciutto and ricotta one. They were all really delicious but the eggplant one was our favorite.For our entrees, my friend got the lobster salad and I got the truffle risotto and we picked off of each others' plates. The salad was refreshing with an amazing vinaigrette that was somehow light and creamy at the same time. The risotto was so flavorful and cheesy and mushroomy and creamy and amazing. I can't say enough good things about it.We shared the raspberry sorbet with meringue for dessert. The sorbet was tart, almost to a point where I couldn't eat it but the meringue was so sweet, it made the perfect accompaniment.The staff was v. attentive and nice and our water glasses were never empty - which is the mark of good service in my book.",1,0,0,Rach K.,"New York, NY",245,1067,853

We did not see the server for another 45 minutes and after that he came back saying he forgot to place half our order and they should be in shortly.

I think how Fig & Olive differentiate itself from other spots is that it is one of the few places that offer such delicious healthy selection. I would highly recommend all of its salads and main dishes. The portion size is huge and they are generous with the meats. For a quick appetizers, ask for their olive platter. Their free bread selection is dipped in 3 different types of olive oils. I come here often and each time I leave feeling satisfied.

At every course, they kept asking if we were done, ready to take our plates...If you see that the plate is not even half way finished and utensils still on hand, it's obvious that we are not done! 2  minutes after the dessert was placed on the table, the check followed. We didn't ask for it nor did they care to mention, ""take your time, we'll take it when you are ready"". Instead, they kept hovering and checking if we had already provided our card. Considering we had cocktails, 3 course meal and wine, we were in and out in less than an hour and half. I eat out on an average 3x/wk and I have never felt so rushed out of a restaurant.

It was a bit bland and the bowl they used had a little dip in the bottom (not sure what these plates are called) but basically the oils all gathered there so eventually whatever pasta was there was sitting in a pool of oil.

However, the reviews were favorable. And the lamb did indeed come smoked a-la-minute, under a glass cover. It added nice drama & a yummy campfire-esque aroma.)Now for the complaint: our waiter was a combo of strange, pushy, rude, and clueless. He asked my friend to throw away her outside coffee cup (this is not necessarily strange, but we just sat down and were planning on spending a lot of money at their establishment), he made a hard sell for the Crostini (both before AND after we ordered plenty of other appetizers), & he made unwelcome recommendations on the menu (we were starting to think this up-selling was a thing there). The best (or worst) part was when our friends asked if the restaurant had Lagavulin available, to which our waiter said yes. He brought them two ""scotches"" in low ball glasses. All our palates were refined enough to immediately note that he did not, in fact, bring scotch, but rather, bourbon. He then not only admitted that what was in the glass was actually Bulleit bourbon, but that it was (I'm not kidding.) the same thing as Lagavulin. When the mistake was fixed, we thought the drama was over, until the bill came and we realized our friends had been charged $32 each for their glass of brown liquor. A brief conversation with the understanding manager and the charges were stricken from the record.You can't make this stuff up. That last bit about the service was mainly to tell a good story. I mean, people will go here anyway because the food is good. But there are enough restaurants in Manhattan with comparable menus, prices, and ambiance, where you don't have to swallow the bitter pill of poor service and still get a good meal.

5.0,9/7/2013,"I am absolutely in love with this restaurant and I'm so glad to have attended my friend's Bridal Shower here! The food was delicious, the place is gorgeous and the staff are very attentive. This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city now. Best of all, I was able to park across the street from the restaurant. Thank you NY for inventing a 6 hour parking meter and not letting these parking garage take my money and run for it. We spent around 4.5 hours in this place. Great jobs by the bridesmaids!Why do I think this place is the best to have a party or bring a date? It's truly beautiful. Upstairs was reserved for us and as you're walking up their stairs, they have these candle lit lanterns (I can picture how beautiful it would have been during the night as they dim down their lights). The walls are gorgeously decorated with tea-light candles and different frames. Wait until I mention their foods. We started with Chef's choice on Crostini which were toast served with different kinds of fish, meats, and vegetables. There were shrimps with guacamole, mushrooms, salmon, tuna, peanut and cheese, and figs with scallions. They also had french fries served with different herbs and truffle oil which were the best fries I've ever had. Also, they make the most amazing drinks of all. I don't often drink alcohol, but I personally loved their white sangria served with blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. For appetizers, I decided to go for the Truffle Mushroom Croquette. They were crimini mushroom with parmesan cheese and béchamel sauce (which is a Truffle Olive Oil Aioli dressing). ABSOLUTELY A MUST TRY! My friend ordered the Fig Gorgonzola Tart which had warm gorgonzola, prosciutto, fig, walnut, arugula, scallion, and tomato served on a fine puff pastry. For the main course, I ordered their Rivera Organic Salmon with a side of grilled asparagus, braised endive, cauliflower puree with basil infused oil. YUM!Last but not least, I was in love with their dessert. I was so mad that I accidentally deleted the picture of my Chocolate Pot De Creme. I've never had such amazing creamy chocolate mousse served chilled with vanilla cream. My friend ordered the Fresh Berries with Green Apple Sorbet (2nd favorite dessert of the night). The sorbet tasted like apple sauce. Thank you Fig & Olive, I had a wonderful time! Will be back one day!",2,2,2,Win C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",325,623,3078

The food though is delicious and actually the items that we ordered that the waiter didn't recommend were better than the ones he did.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu as well as off the restaurant week menu.  We had 3 crostini's - Burrata, Tomato, Herbs, Balsamic, Manchego, Fig, Marcona Almond, Prosciutto, Ricotta, Fig, Olive, Walnut.  All 3 were great.  I would say the Manchengo was one of my favorites because of the Fig which made it sweet.  We ordered the paella and the truffle risotto for entrees.  The waiter didn't recommend the paella and I found like I liked it a lot better than the risotto.  There was more variety in the taste of it.  The dessert was good but must not have been all that memorable if I can't even remember what it was!  Overall, the food is good here but the wait for a table really damages the experience.",0,0,0,Kim W.,"New York, NY",19,240,31

I started with the mushroom croquettes which were over the top. For my first time ever braved the rose wine and loved it. It was between champagne and wine and precisely what I wanted. For dinner I picked the chicken and was blown away! Yes. By chicken! The meat was juicy and moist (but not greasy). The veggies were perfect ..figs, olives, peaches, carrots.

I can probably eat 6+ for myself. The idea of raw beef always turned me off but, on the recommendation of my friend, we ordered beef carpaccio. It was delicious - thinly sliced and topped with balsamic, some greens, and cherry tomatoes. Yumm. The appetizer scallops were tender and sweet, 3 small ones to a plate. For dessert, our server recommended the mango sorbet but we went with something heavier, the chocolate souffle with orange peel and vanilla ice cream. It was pretty satisfying though I have had better fluffier ones. The chocolate was kinda thick and.. pastelike? and the orange peel piece was kinda a big strip in there and I just ate it separately. I did enjoy my drink, the summer in provence cocktail. I tried the mojito which was also nice. Kinda pricy though.

3.0,8/8/2013,"My friends and I ate at fig and Olive last night for restaurant week 2013. The place is a bit small and cramped but overall nice ambiance. The service. I really don't know where to start. After we sat down, three other tables sat and all received olive oils and bread and we didn't until after we ordered wine and our meals. It was very unpleasant and unprofessional. Moreover, the waiter was rarely in sight when we needed him which was also a problem. The service comes off ""high end"" but in essence it's far from. I'd rather not have a pompous waiter and actually receive SERVICE than have someone who's all fancy the few times he's actually around to GIVE service. I wasn't pleased in this department. Food- average. The Crostinis my friends I started off with we're superb. They were delicious bites and a great start to a meal. I wouldn't recommend skipping them. The tuna was phenomenal and the mushroom and Parmesan one were amazing. For our appetizers my friend had these lobster somosas which she loved. They were served over a mango and vegetable chutney which complimented the somosas great (or so she said). My other two friends and I had mushroom croquettes which were delicious. Perfectly fried mushroom balls lightly breaded served over a creamy béchamel sauce with thick Parmesan shavings atop. They really were outstanding.  As per our entrees. My friends shrimp in her paella was undercooked and we waited a good 10 minutes till the waiter finally took it back to the kitchen. My other two friends filet mignon looked amazing. Cooked to perfect temperatures. They loved it. I had the tuna steak and it was nothing as the menu described. It wasn't crusted, it was grilled. Moreover it was served in a pool of olive oil. The eggplant caviar was simply a lump of roasted eggplant aside my plate. The tuna was also over cooked. I asked for rare to medium rare. I got medium WELL. It killed the taste of the tuna but at this point I was hungry so I just kept eating. Dessert- we tried the chocolate creme de pot which was rich and decadent. It was accompanied by the perfect praline. As per the fig and olive waffle, it was bland. It lacked flavor, it wasn't fresh and there was nothing special about it. I would give this restaurant a second chance and go back to try their real menu. Perhaps their restaurant week menu just didn't give the restaurant the reputation it deserves. There was items I loved eating while others were a flop. Therefore, I wouldn't mind going back to try other things off the menu. Besides, their items are fresh and delicious and that is key",0,0,0,Isaac E.,"Flushing, NY",55,54,86

My husband actually took me here the night he proposed and I decided to try it once again for Restaurant Week 2013before I wrote a review.  Just like the last time, it was superb with fairly great service.  We started with the crostinis which were my favorite part of the meal. They were all generous in serving size and most full of flavor that blended well, but the ones with sweetness weren't particularly my favorite.  I absolutely loved the mushroom and artichoke one, which the waiter recommended. For the restaurant week appetizer, I chose the beef tartare. It isn't their usual tartare, which is flat and thinly sliced on the plate. This time, it was more thickly cut and molded into a very thick cube. still delicious and has more blends than the sliced kind.  For the entree, I got the lobster risotto. Never have I seen giant huge claws and tails! Although the risotto portion looks small, it was very filling with generous amounts of lobster. It was worth every penny!Lastly for dessert, I ordered the waffle and berries. Unfortunately this wasn't the best part of the meal.

The prix fix brunch includes an appetizer, and entree with coffee/tea at the end. I started with the TRUFFLE MUSHROOM CROQUETTE served hot and fresh and was wonderful. To continue with the mushroom theme, my entree was the PENNE FUNGHI TARTUFO.

Food: 4/5The crostinis were very tasty, especially the Mushroom, Artichoke. The pairing was very unique, and the taste very deliciously memorable. The other two, Goat Cheese, Caramelized Onions, and Prosciutto, Ricotta were safe crowd-pleasers. For lunch, we had the lamb skewers and the seafood paella. The paella was quite tasty, but the lamb skewers were not very memorable. As dessert, we got the Andrew tasting plate, and the most memorable dish there was the mango sorbet. The mini chocolate pot de creme lost its charm without the crunch of the lady fingers.Service: 5/5Waitress was attentive and even remade my mojito when it was too strong.

We had crostinis, the cheeseboard, the lobster bisque, the fig and gorgonzola tarlet, chilean sea bass, fettucini shrimp and veal milanese.  I would say the most fun and interesting eating was the crostinis and cheeseboard.  My friend had the lobster bisque and said it wasn't the best she's had  BUT in defense of the restaurant when I read the description on the menu, I thought it might be a little different than what my friend expected.  She said it wasn't bad, but not what she expected.  Beside trying the crostinis, the fig gorgonzola tarlet is recommended as well as the Chilean Sea Bass and Fettucini Shrimp.  It was a lovely evening with great food.  We all enjoyed the restaurant!",0,0,0,M I.,"Honolulu, HI",1,24,32

5.0,1/18/2013,"Is Fig and Olive (F&O) the definitive restaurant for a Mediterranean experience? Not necessarily. Does it offer some of the best service and ambiance for a New York City restaurant? Doubtful. Will this be on your list for a Restaurant Week destination? It's possible. True to form, F&O as a whole is a three-star experience as its composite Yelp rating indicates.While all this may be true, it is a five-star experience for foodies and educated eaters. In other words, F&O is perfect for food lovers with a focus. Those who have an affection for figs and olive oil will definitely have made a visit. Those who love small bites will love their soups, salads, and crostinis. And for those who enjoy crostinis, F&O is frakking amazing!  As an eater with a focus and adventurous spirit (like Emily G.), the allure of enjoying delicious crostinis topped with fresh, salty and savory ingredients is irresistible.  Any individual that recommends Fig and Olive as a destination is sure to highlight their crostini selection as the main attraction.

3.0,12/24/2012,"Fig and Olive is one of the most schizophrenic restaurants that I've been to in New York, or anywhere for that matter. The highs are very high - the crostini selection is tremendous, and there is an option for every taste. Fresh, savory toppings sit on toasted bread and the wide array of olive oils seem to be carefully selected for each - the flavors of everything really come through. Another bright spot is their dessert menu, and I don't usually opt for the last course. The pot de creme is unbelievably good; rich but not overpowering and won't weigh you down.As for what I don't love about Fig & Olive. First, the portion of the entrees. On my last trip to Fig & Olive, I opted for the Veal Medallions. As for taste, the food was spot on. The veal was tender and juicy, and the mushrooms, tapenade, and potatoes served as great accompaniments to the dish. HOWEVER - the portion was really small, especially given the $35 price tag. There were 4 or 5 small veal medallions, and the sides didn't add any true sustenance. After finishing my meal (it only took ~5 minutes, even going back and forth with the wine), I was still hungry. The wine was tasty, but with the 'cheap' selections still north of $12, I could again feel my wallet getting lighter.Fig & Olive is best experienced as a quick stop to enjoy an appetizer, and maybe a drink. If you are planning on having a full meal, I would recommend piecing as many crostini and small plates together as needed to feel satisfied.

This wasn't bad since the kitchen view was only partial due to a wall of olive oil bottles. However the room was very very cold and we all were a bit uncomfortable with the temperature and noticed other tables with people still wearing their scarves and jackets. There was cold air blowing ups from the wall. Actually cold became the theme of the dinner. When our food arrived some of the dishes were served cold. One order of lamb chops was sent back and some side dishes too. I had the filet mignon which was ok and the fingerling side potatoes were quite good.    The manager was kind enough to send over a round of dessert wines to our table to make up for the cold food. 3 of us ordered cappuccinos which ...no surprise were served lukewarm.

I will definitely continue to dine at fig and olive.I've been to Fig & Olive at this location as well as the locations downtown and each time the food was great.This experience today was a complete 180 of the quality of food that I've been use to.  I ordered the Branzino for lunch and the fact that it came out luke warm only 10 minutes after I placed the order was a bit alarming.  Not to mention the fact that the fish looked like it had been sitting out for about an hour, it was dry, bland, and the skin was not crispy, but rather soggy and difficult to cut through.  I know how this dish should taste because I've had it before and this was a major disappointment.  The whipped potatoes that it came with was hard as a rock and stone cold as well! I should have sent it back!They also ran out of Earl grey tea, which isnt as big of a deal, but was just another disappointment to not have my favorite tea following a horrible lunch!Management needs to get involved with better quality control with the dishes that get sent out.  This was unacceptable!",0,0,0,Jazmin A.,"New York, NY",49,21,0
1.0,11/11/2012,"Talk about a misleading Yelp rating. My experience at Fig & Olive was not good. I have zero intention of every returning for lunch. Fig & Olive is just a few blocks up from my office and I met a friend there on my lunch break. I was the first to arrive. The area by the door was surrounded by people who were waiting since they don't seat you until your entire party arrives.....for lunch really?Once we sat down our server promptly came to our table and we ordered entrees. The weather had been chilly and with a sore throat I decided to order the carrot soup thinking some hot soup would soothe my scratchy throat. The soup was cold.....what the hell? It was also bland, drowning in olive oil, and just all around mediocre. They were out of the sandwich I wanted so I ordered the pumpkin ravioli. There was a 45 min gap between getting my soup and getting my entree. When I come into a restaurant for lunch during the workday I expect them to move quickly. I don't have all the time in the world to hang out. I have to get back to work and that is just unacceptable. Not to mention our server pulled a disappearing act. When we finally tracked her down and asked about our entrees she was all ""oh they should be out any minute let me check on them."" They arrived lukewarm.

3.0,11/4/2012,"As many reviewers before mentioned, the crostinis are the bomb, particularly the manchego, fig and almond crostini. For an entree, I got the penne funghi tartufo. I was super excited by the simple fact that it had truffle oil, lots of mushrooms and pasta, which are some of my favorite ingredients. How could you go wrong?! I must say, I was disappointed. The dish was very bland, even when topped with parmesan flakes. Meanwhile, the dish was drowning in scallions, which I enjoy...but in moderation. I felt like I was eating scallions, accompanied by mushrooms and some cheese. Maybe the other entrees are a different story.The vibe was pretty much what you'd expect from a midtown east/5th ave-y Mediterranean joint. Very chic-modern with bottles of olive oil all around.

5.0,9/13/2012,"I lived in NYC over the summer and was lucky enough to experience all the food options it has to offer during restaurant week! One of my coworkers actually took me here on our lunch break one day. Our office is right over on Madison and it was the closest-nicest place in that specific area of Midtown. I can recall walking by a couple of times and really wanting to try it out. From the outside, it looks extremely well decorated, they have a long bar and high tables with business men and women drinking wine and snacking on small plates. Plus, anything with olives in the name is a no brainer for me! I looked the menu up online and was hesitant to spend the money going to this place by myself for lunch, but when the opportunity arose to go with a coworker, I was all for it.Like I said, lucky for us, it was right in the middle of restaurant week where lots of NYC restaurants will offer a pre fixe menu at a reasonable price. It's the perfect way to sample a little bit of everything the place has to offer. I forget the price but it was somewhere around $25 a person and we got our choice of an appetizer or salad, entrée, and dessert. Side note :: when it is not restaurant week, they do offer a pre fixe lunch menu for $28. We both ended up ordering the same thing. We started with the complimentary crostini and olive oils. I'm not a fan of bread and oil, but theirs was great! Each oil had a unique and distinct taste to it and it was the perfect way to get my palette warmed up to all the great food I was about to taste. For my starter, I got the fig and olive salad. It's a big mesclun salad topped with juicy apples, smooth manchego, sweet figs, gorgonzola, tomatoes, walnuts, and three different kinds of olives. The salad is then tossed in light layer of fig balsamic and olive oil dressing. I honestly could have stopped here. My favorite part of the salad was definitely the manchego and olives. Everything complimented each other perfectly! For my entrée, I ordered the Chilean sea bass. I'm a huge fan of fish, I usually eat it a few times a week just for lunch, but for some reason I had never had Chilean sea bass before. I think I was expecting a sweeter, fuller fish when I got it, but it was surprisingly light, fluffy, and took on the flavor of the oil, thyme, carrot, and celery it was cooked with. Fingerling potatoes topped with charmoula sauce (basically a mixture of garlic, lemon, thyme and other Mediterranean seasonings) came as a side. My coworker thought her fish was a bit fishy, but I loved mine. I would definitely order it again as it was a lighter and more summery choice that would probably go well all year round. Finally for dessert, we chose the dessert crostini which was basically Fig and Olive's take on strawberry shortcake. It was a shortcake crostini cookie, dusted with a mascarpone cheese spread, topped with a sliced strawberry, and drizzled off with a balsamic reduction. I noticed that some people here said the balsamic part was weird, but if you know food, you know that a balsamic reduction is like syrup. Its sweetened, but also adds a big of tanginess to the fruit. The crostini was probably the side of a triscut cracker so you didn't feel bloated and too full to finish up the rest of the day.I have since moved back to Chicago and I am definitely craving some unique food pairings from Fig and Olive. I will definitely frequent this place a lot when I move back to NYC to start my career. There are so many endless options on the menu and there really is something for everyone. Don't get put off if you don't like figs, olives, Greek, or Mediterranean. Fig and Olive is a modern take on old, rustic food and there is something to please every diner's palette!",5,4,3,Christina F.,"Chicago, IL",322,280,162

1.0,9/10/2012,"Horrible, horrible service.   Looked on open table...lots of openings for tables (as it was past theater time), but I was waiting on an out of town business person stuck in a meeting,  so we just strolled in when she was done.  At first it was great...walked in, nice place...and I said we don't have a reservation, the host said no problem, said they could seat us right away (no surprise based on open table). ...told us to go right upstairs. Up there we were treated badly when they found out we did not have reservations. Told to stand to the side...not a lot of room at the top of the stairs!  There were plenty of tables.  Finally they sat us...  It was a 90 plus degree day and they sat us by the kitchen, looking into where they dumped the food.  We complained and said could we have one of the better tables for two (again there were LOTS of empty tables) and they said this is all they had ...because the other tables were all reserved and these are the tables for people without reservatins.  PEOPLE GRAB YOUR IPHONE, USE THE APP AND MAKE A RESERVATION BEFORE YOU WALK IN THE DOOR...THERE WERE OPENINGS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES AT THIS RESTAURANT ON OPEN TABLE...no reason to be treated this way.  I almost thought it would have been better to leave, grab my iphone, reserve and table, and come back in and see if I could get a better table.   But... we were hungry and tired, so we just sat in this bad table...and waited...and waited.  Insult to injury.   We didn't have menus, we didn't have place settings, we didn't get water.  We tried to get attention...but all the waiters were running, sweating, and crazy, so I felt kind of sorry for them.  But then it was ridiculous...as stressed as the staff looked, we did watch other tables seated long after us being served.  I kept putting up my hand only to be ignored.  I finally physically stood up and stopped someone and said (nicely), could we please have a waiter.  It helped a little, but it was never great service, never great food, and just a miserable dining experience overall.  I had to put on a good face for my out of town colleague.  To other potential diners who are local....this may be a restaurant that caters to tourists, so behavior like this can happen in Midtown.  I'm a local and my friend and I were in full business attire. WE ordered a bottle of wine and three courses...because we were hungry, not because of anything that F&O did to entice us to spend any $$ at all.   This is one restaurant that I thought had a good reputation and rating (maybe the other locationis), but I will never return to this one.  This is NYC, even in Midtown you do not have to be treated like this.  Most Midtown restaurants can be ""meh""...but generally you get good service.  To others who wish to try this restaurant, AT LEAST MAKE A RESERVATION. You might get a better table and perhaps better service. But for me, there are plenty of other better choices in the neighborhood.",2,0,0,Rosemary A.,"New York, NY",15,23,1

Mascapone, balsamic + sliced macerated strawberries is not the stuff of dreams...The seasoning of the food was average at best, although the olive oil presented with the bread was delicious + fragrant.

We started with a plate of bread with three different olive oils to dip. My husband opted for the Restaurant Week menu, and I ordered a la carte. He started with the Fig, Gorgonzola, and Manchego salad. I definitely stuck my fork into his bowl a number of times; the dressing was light, and the contrasting flavors of cheese with the sweet figs was fresh and memorable! His main course was branzino a la plancha, which he reported was cooked perfectly/was tasty.My dinner selection was the Zucchini Blossom and Goat Cheese Ravioli. It was beautiful and absolutely scrumptious. There were thinly sliced ribbons of zucchini on top, as well as fried squash blossoms, which added a nice salty crunch in contrast to the creamy goat cheese ravioli. I practically licked my plate clean.There are a number of Fig & Olive locations in New York City, so I definitely would recommend looking one up if you're in town!

4.0,8/15/2012,"Disclaimer: I do not like figs, nor do I like olives. But I decided to risk it and come to a restaurant called Fig & Olive. I managed to avoid eating any figs and olives, and had a very pleasant dining experience.I came here with a friend from out of town and had a very pleasant dining experience. I arrived slightly earlier and was seated upstairs (they have 2 floors). While waiting for my friend, the waiter brought me bread with 3 types of olive oils and explained where each oil came from. I didn't like 2 out of  3 of the olive oils because it tasted like grass, and made me feel like a cow, so I just stuck to the most normal tasting olive oil. I wish I knew the name of out waiter but I really don't remember. Not only was he a walking dictionary, he was also good at making recommendations. We started off with the crostinis (basically an expensive piece of toast with toppings) at an additional charge of $16. We tried the following crostinis:1. Burata, tomaato, herbs, balsamic: the burata, which is a super rich cheese, was amazing.2. Cucumber, shallot, yogurt, pink, peppercorn: I didn't like the taste of it, and the pink peppercorn was weird3. Salmon, ricotta, citrus, cilantro: delicious!4. shrimp, avocado, cilnatro, tomato: delicious as well5. crab, yogurt, tarragon, tomato: delicious!6. mushroom, truffle artichoke, scallion, parmesan: can't go wrong with this!For my starter, I had the salmon carpaccio. I chose it because I love sashimi and this was the closest thing on the menu to sashimi. It came in some sort of olive oil/ lime marinade, which was ok.As for my main course, I had the fig and olive summer chicken tajine. The chicken was extremely tender, the meat was literally falling off the bone. It came with a side of cous cous, that came with 3 toppings including almonds. The cous cous was ok, I'm not a fan of cous cous in general. As for desert, my friend and I ordered the strawberry desert ""crostini"" and the chocolate mousse with cream on top, and decided to share. The strawberry desert was basically 2 slices of strawberry on a cookie, with balsamic vinegar. It was a weird combination, my friend and I secretly hoped the vinegar was chocolate syrup. The chocolate mousse was not bad, but not special.I had seen online that you could do the sommelier wine tasting for $20, but I am not sure why I didn't see that option on the actual menu of the restaurant.

But I encountered enough issues that I know I won't be coming back. We both ordered the prie fixe brunch menu. For $28 you get a drink, two dish and coffee/ tea. I had a diet coke, granola with fresh fruits & yogurt, truffles scrambled eggs, and coffee. The good - the granola was HUGE and quite tasty; coffee was nice. The bad - diet coke was FLAT. It tasted like sugared water, like the bottle had been opened for days and the fizz was all gone. The scrambled egg was under seasoned. What a waste of truffles.The worst - so my friend finished her first dish way before I did (like I said the granola was HUGE). The waiter decided to drop our 2nd dish when I was only half way through my granola. There wasn't even enough room on the table to put my scrambled eggs! I literally had to adjust my chair cuz my granola got pushed to the side! Come on!!! And then I noticed there was a HAIR in the side salad on the scrambled eggs. So we told the waiter about the HAIR, and if he could just bring the whole dish back to keep it warm while I finish my granola. He took the dish away. When I finally finished my granola, they brought back my eggs and salad, WITH THE HAIR!!!!

The service was a bit slow, and our waitress seemed confused but I figured she may have been new and/or overwhelmed with the lunch/restaurant week crowd. The decor is awesome, simple and elegant.

2.0,7/14/2012,"We were disappointed with this restaurant and should have paid more attention to the Yelp reviews. It was difficult to find a restaurant in midtown before our show because we did not want to pay a lot of money for our dinner (by NYC standards), we had a vegetarian with us, and when in manhattan we want a local restaurant, not a chain.As we walked in, four employees were discussing that they ran out of wine glasses and did not know how they were going to serve wine to all the expected guests. Fortunately, I ordered a wine right away and it was served in a wine glass.We were not as fortunate with dinner. The service was slow and in attentive with the exception of the busman who did an excellent job. I will admit that we asked for two separate checks which probably didn't endear us to the waiter.Three of our four dinners came out one at a time over 5-7 minutes. We waited about 5 more minutes for the fourth entree until we finally flagged down the hostess who happened to be passing our table. The waiter then came over and asked what our final guest ordered for dinner. We knew something was up.By this time we had been there over an hour and were concerned about finishing dinner prior to our broadway show. By the time her dinner was served, the rest of our entrees were, of course, cold. The food was ok, but once cold, we did not get to make a fair judgement on this.As a manager passed about 5 minutes later, I told him we were going to a broadway show and needed our checks. Even though we were still eating, I thought I should get the process started.We finished eating and Again we waited. The waiter made his way over and asked what we had ordered for the dessert on on prix fixe meal. We told him we did not have time at that point for dessert and just needed our checks so we could get to our show. We also asked that he take dessert off our bill.Again, we waited. He finally brought us one check, after which He served dessert anyway. In the restaurant's defense, they deducted 10% from our bill for the errors.At this point, we were very concerned about making it to our show in 20 minutes.As we left, one of the upstairs manager told us the hostess was hailing a cab for us. She did not. Had the food been better or the prices more reasonable, perhaps we would have had a better experience.We only get to visit manhattan once every couple of years and really look forward to the fabulous restaurants here and this one really let us down.",1,0,0,Tracy P.,"Palm Springs, CA",55,29,12

Manchego is one of my favorite cheeses, so I was automatically a fan. The almond brought some nice nutty flavor and texture to the mix.The mushroom/truffle artichoke starter was also delicious. There was definitely a healthy portion of mushroom on the toast.After appetizers, I had the gazpacho, which was a little bland. Didn't think it was worth the $9.50, but I'm no gazpacho expert.For my entree, I had the shrimp and salmon salad. I've had shrimp that's been both bigger and fresher, but that's not to say their shrimp was bad. It just wasn't noteworthy in any way. The salmon was good, as was the olive oil dressing really pulled it all together.Their coffee also leaves a bit to be desired for, but it was still a good way to cap off the meal.",1,0,0,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015
3.0,6/28/2012,"I've actually known about this place (Well, the meatpacking branch that is) for a while and when my friend had invited me to come eat here I jumped at the chance. The experience itself was somewhat mixed. I step into the restaurant and my first impression: ""What a beautiful restaurant... but why is the area by the maître d' so hot? Where's the air-conditioning?"" My friends show up and we're shown to a table upstairs. The restaurant is very nice and chic looking.To start, we ordered the ""crostini"" which is kind of like a bruschetta. We got the prosciutto, the mushroom and the red bell pepper one. My favorite one was the mushroom one. The prosciutto one was very good as well, though the red bell pepper one I think I would pass on if I ever came back here. I would definitely recommend that anyone coming here to eat order the crostini, it's quite good.Then, I had the Fig & Olive salad. The salad dressing is a bit lighter than what I usually like, but overall it was a great salad. The ingredients used were very good and I enjoyed it a lot.Unfortunately, the great appetizers marked the end of the great meal. My friend ordered a paella which she felt was lacking in flavor. My other friend ordered the Chilean sea bass which she said was so so. As for me, I ordered the spaghetti calamari. The spaghetti itself had a strange texture and was on the soggy side. Also, while I love eating squid tentacles... in this instance, squid tentacles with soggy spaghetti was just unpleasant, they should have stuck with squid rings. In the end, I couldn't really finish my entree.Dessert however was a better experience. I ordered the tart du jour which was a chocolate tart while my friend ordered the apple sorbet. Both came out really well.If I could just come here, have a drink and order an appetizer- that's all I would really want from here. Unless some improvement is shown with their entrees, I'm not sure I'd come back.

I generally recommend this restaurant for brunch, though. It's got a great vibe, great natural light, and though a bit froo-froo, is really classy and well-maintained. If you pile up on the ordering, your bill will probably be big. It's not a cheap restaurant. But if you stick to the basics - like the incredible fig & olive salad - you'll walk away full and VERY happy (and your wallet will still be intact).Sidenote: I also bought oil & fig-infused vinegar to use at home, it's really great, and I sometimes stop in just for that.",0,0,0,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",13,106,4

I highly recommend the Olive Dirty Martini. It had a wonderful flavor-tasted like olive juice with a kick!We started out with a trio of crostini""s and the zucchini carpaccio as starters for the table. They were very good and flavorful. As mains I can vouch for the filet mignon and the special of the day- whole Branzino fish. They fillet the fish at the table. It was outstanding. My wife's filet was very good as well. The only disappointment I had was my olive oil mashed potatoes were cold. I should have sent them back. If you go, you have to order their chocolate Pot De Creme for dessert.

The truffle oil was the most distinct taste in the dish and I loved the abundance of mushrooms. I was able to pack the rest of the meal back for another meal!

If you're a fan of infused oils (oceans of olive oil and truffle oil were used throughout the meal!) then you'll love it here =). First of all, we were given warm bread with a sampler of various olive oils to start. Delicious! All the oils were sooo good that we kept asking for more bread. My first course was the mushroom truffle soup. Sooo good! It was creamy and just bursting with truffle-y flavor. You also get some bread to dip in it, which is a plus. My main course was the pumpkin ravioli, which was also quite tasty. My only gripe there was the portion size, I would have liked more than the few pieces of ravioli that I got! Others in my group got the chicken, which was super tender and came with a variety of yummy roasted root vegetables. For dessert, we all shared the chocolate pot de creme and dessert crostini. The chocolate was definitely the winner here, but I liked the crostini as well (minus the nasty medicine tasting cherries served on top that we removed).

But don't take it out on the guests!Fig & Olive was the worst of the restaurants I tried over the last two weeks (by far!)  The food was unimaginative and the service horrendous.Having the plate removed before your fork is out of your mouth is annoying. Having the next course thrown onto the table by a server who's head is turned over his shoulder and already walking away before the plate even hits the table is an insult.The food was bland. The chef obviously doesn't know what a bouillabaise or tajine is. Both dishes were absent in flavor. The bouillabaise lacked the rich seafood stock flavor with the undertone of saffron... probably because there was no stock to begin with. It was so thick, they should have just called it a puree. No crouton either! You only get a bowl of soup... no bread refills during our visit. Ugh. The tajine wasn't served in a tajine. The vegetables were too big to eat readily. And the spices were so dull, all I got was a lingering bitterness. Mr. Chef, please stick with what you know. (I'm not sure what that is...)Utter disappointment.

4.0,2/3/2012,"This place was bustling at lunch!  The entrance was congenially and comically crowded, but my friend and I were seated at our reserved table pretty quickly once we were both there.  Definitely make a res if you want to have lunch here.The olive oil trio with bread was a nice treat.  We ordered from the RW menu where truffle oil appeared surprisingly in the majority of the dishes.  I could hear the Chopped judges in my head protesting ""NOooOOooo!!!  It's a copout!  Don't do it!""  Don't get me wrong, I love truffle oil and yeah, basically everything is better with truffles, but I like variety in a meal...though as it turned out, I'm pretty sure I ended up, happily, truffling out with both of my choices.  For app I had my first ever beef carpacchio (how had I never had it before? I just don't know) and it was super delicious.  Then main was penne with mushrooms, parmesan, parsley, and truffle oil.  The mushrooms were delicious, and other than being a little too oily it was a great light pasta dish.  My friend had the seafood bouillabaisse which looked awesome, but very saucy and oddly they didn't give her a spoon, which brought to mind the new French diet fad ""forking"" (it's a thing - look it up).  We shared one of each dessert, which were both heavenly and perfectly smallish.Service was speedy until it came time to get the check, when we had to wait a while, but our waitress was very friendly despite being obviously crazy busy.  This was a good place to ""lunch"" (and I mean that in the upscale, Midtown way) with a good friend whose presence I don't mind splurging on eats to enjoy.  I would go back.  The regular menu salads looked yummy.",0,0,0,Sherri M.,"Brooklyn, NY",214,384,148
3.0,2/2/2012,"Went for Restaurant Week with two friends.  Ambiance and decor are great.  Our waitress was incredibly pleasant and more than willing to offer suggestions and her opinion about the menu.  We started with assorted crostini which were absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend the one with the proscuitto and the fig.  For my appetizer I had the Truffle Mushroom Soup and it had great truffle flavor, just a tad bit on the oily side but probably because they top the soup with the truffle olive oil.  I was pretty disappointed with my main dish.  I ordered the pumpkin sage ravioli and I had such high hopes but the dish didn't deliver.  The ravioli instead of being stuffed with pumpkin, were stuffed with a chicken mixture that had a strange texture and was rather dry.  It definitely needed more ricotta or pumpkin or something.  It was just weird and kinda threw off the entire dish for me.  Oh well.  For dessert I had the chocolate pot de creme and it was AMAZING.  So smooth and rich and chocolately, I absolutely loved it!  Portions appeared kinda small, but I left feeling satisfied and not overly full.  Service was good, if not too quick?  The busboys were hovering waiting to take your plates away as soon as you were done, which was kind of annoying.  All in all, I would give it a solid 3 stars.",0,0,0,Allie M.,"New York, NY",0,36,7

It kind of felt like they were having bus boys learn how to be waitstaff by training at our table both times. Not fun.First of all, don't bother with the crostinis.   When I am home from the bar, drunk, and hungry, I make better culinary delights with whatever mystery ingredients are in my fridge that I slap onto bread/crackers. (You do it too, don't judge). The vegetables are bland, the tartines were boring. I had the seafood bouillabaisse, which was ok. The broth was yummy, but the seafood was just ho-hum.

3.0,1/23/2012,"I have to start off by saying that this review is really a 3.5.  My friends and I came here before we went to Porgy and Bess.  We originally were suppose to have a table of 6 but one of my friends dropped out at the last minute.  Also for the full disclosure of this review, two of my friends got confused and went to one of their other locations down in the Meat Packing district.  (The amazing hostess Vera still let us be seated and we ordered yummy cocktails.)So I choose this restaurant because it's not only Restaurant Week but I wanted to choose a place where I knew the food would be fantastic.  I was not wrong about that whatsoever.  My friends all raved about their dishes.  There wasn't one dish that they didn't like.  We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and I must say that their tuna carpaccio was sinfully good.   (I got the pumpkin ravioli for dinner and while I enjoyed the actual pasta I have a texture issue and the filling totally turned me off.  So this is nothing against the restaurant, I just personally didn't like it but my friends LOVED it.)The only reason this establishment gets 3.5 stars was the service that was provided by our waiter.  Yes I understand that my party got here late but we ordered cocktails.  Yes I understand that you have other tables but it's slightly rude when you roll your eyes because my friends who just sat down to order, wanted to know what is in your dishes.  Yes I know that you have a line out the door but by no means is it okay to drop the check in my lap when I haven't even finished my dessert or asked for the check.  Those things are not okay with me.  I understand if this guy was having an off day but he left a sour note in my mouth.  I would come back here again because the food was excellent but I could care less if the food was mediocre and the service was impeccable.  I go to a restaurant for an experience.  My friends and I had a wonderful time but hopefully that waiter cheers up.",0,0,0,Cynthia L.,"Astoria, NY",32,30,0

We were with a party of 35 so maybe that had something to do with the food but...mixed crostinis although - big and heaping with toppings were tasteless. Starters: My husband and I both enjoyed ours (carpaccio and scallops).  Mains: I had the branzino and it was really very tasty.  My husband ordered the filet mignon and sent it back b/c it was overdone and the side of potatoes was cold.  He chalked it up to the fact that we were a party of 35 - my take is that if you can't properly serve a party of 35, DON""T.  If you're going to charge people $150 - $200 per person (I""m guessing) make sure that EVERYTHING is perfect.  I didn't get to taste his food when it came back.

The ambiance was nice and service was excellent.Now to food and drinks. I loved the selection of olive oils in the beginning! It's a pity that other people reviewing this place are saying that olive oils were blant. They just don't know olive oils. The cocktails were wonderful (I had the one with pear and eggwhite, and a rossellini). Starters were amazing! We had tuna and beef carpacio, and especially beef was divine.The mains were a disapointment though, both in terms of quality and quantity. Hence minus one star. We had the soup (trio del mar or something) and the ravioli. I pity that I didn't order the penne. People on the next table ordered it and it looked and smelled great.Deserts were ok.

The place was packed after work with people sitting and standing around at the bar area.  We got seated upstairs where the interior was just as sweet and welcoming as the downstairs.  There was some lawschool party going on that night so the upstairs was jam-packed with people too!  Didn't mind at all though, the noise kept the place alive.  For starters we had the fig jamon goat cheese, chicken samosas, and some type of ceviche (I forget which one, I think I'm getting old).  Every dish was just as amazing as the next and fig jamon goat cheese was truly a memorable trio!  Never had anything like it!  The bread that came with three different olive oils to dip was good too.  Out of the three oils, only one was a bit funky... other two were aromatic and perfect to get our appetites going!For entrees, we ended up deciding to try every pasta dish they had (adventurous, much?) So I got the paghetti mediterraneo, and two other friends got the pumpkin ravioli and penne funghi.  Lisa P. went with the mediterranean tasting (what a daredevil that one is!).  My pasta was amazing because it had cilantro and I have yet to try a pasta dish that uses cilantro right.  The shrimp was fresh and the dish overall felt pretty light for a load of carbs.  The pumpkin ravioli was amaaaazing and portions were just right.  Wasn't a huge fan of the penne.  A tad flavorless to me and I ended up just eating the mushrooms in it.  Lisa seemed very satisfied with her tasting entree as well.  It came on a lonnggg dish with a whole bunch of stuff on it - definitely recommend to people who want a little bit of everything.We also had raspberry mojitos which were the highlight of the night!  I think it was my first time trying raspberry-flavored mojitos and they were definitely the tastiest mojitos I've ever had!  Mixologist, thumbs up to you!Great experience and I will definitely be going again for drinks/small plates/dinner/what have you!",0,0,0,Cheryl K.,"New York, NY",43,119,0

I understand olive oil is a specialty of theirs but, jesus, too much of anything is no good.  My sandwich was DOUSED -- I literally had to pick it up with napkins to avoid it dripping down my hands as I ate.   The steak itself tasted like roast beef you get from the deli.  The cheese was lackluster.

And we usually try for a place that will make our taste buds sing.I showed up a little early, or my friends were running late. Needless to say, the hostess was really kind and even suggested that I sit at the bar and grab a mimosa if I wanted. I didn't, but it was nice for her to make the suggestion. All too often, you may enter a place and just be ignored. Even though I wasn't seated, I felt comfortable and at ease. Our waitress was very pleasant and gave us the proper amount of time to figure out what we wanted. We opted for the 6 Crostini adn each picked 2 different crostini. They were all delicious. I had the Salmon and the Roasted Bell Pepper crostinis. They were both tasty. The ones my friends picked were also delicious, but I can't remember which ones they got. They all looked so tasty. For the actual brunch dish, I went with the South of France Poached Eggs with Salmon. So, I had never had poached eggs before, but have a love for eggs over easy. Poached eggs aren't for everyone. But I happen to love them! Why not get something you've never tried before at a place that will do it right. Totally worth it.Oh, and you must try one of their cocktails. The Rossellini was good and very beachy. It was a freezing day in NY when we went, so it was kinda ironic. One friend got the Pear Blanche, and I must say it was very delicious. The black peppercorn sprinkled on top actually surprised us all. It went amazingly well with this drink. My other friend got the Summer in Provence, summery type drink. This one also surprised me with how delicious it was.Fig & Olive is definitely deserving of a return trip. The only negative thing that caught my attention was the B rating placed low on the window.

4.0,9/25/2011,"Fig & Olive on 5th totally exceeded my expectations on both food and ambiance.  I met a friend here whom I hadn't seen in quite a while, and wanted to make sure I picked a place that would be memorable.  The space is two floors, with a skinny bar up front and a few awkward 2-seaters surrounding the runway back to the main dining room.  Upstairs, however, it's much more spacious, with several tables hosting larger parties, a few booths, and tables in the center.  The place glows light orange, with several small candles lining the walls, giving the room a very cozy feel.  We shared a selection of bruschetta, which are the star of the show at F&O in my opinion.  The shrimp avocado and crab avocado were predictably my faves, but my friends enjoyed the combination of sweet jelly and sharp cheese on one, and the truffled mushroom & artichoke on the other.  Skip the black olive and bresaola - it's way too salty.  I'd double up on the truffled mushroom and crab avocado when sampling 6.Additionally, the fig gorgonzola tartlet is a great sweet starter with a crispy croissant-like pastry and a spicy bite of arugula.  The prosciutto atop is generously portioned and deliciously cured.  I never go for sweet appetizers, so this was a departure for me, but I'm glad i did.  I wish our appetites had been bigger so we could sample more pastas - but we had to split the penne funghi tartufo.  Can't go wrong with truffled olive oil and thick shards of parmesan on top.  It wasn't the most flavorful or spicy pasta I've ever tried, but I found myself going back for bite after bite long after I felt full.Good for a special occasion, especially with family, or for a small gathering of friends - definitely good for people comfortable with sharing.",1,0,0,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4
4.0,9/25/2011,"I am generally a little cautious of ""chain"" restaurants but i was very pleasantly surprised with Fig & Olive. Our party of 2 sat upsairs, and most reviews here gripe about the service.  I'll admit it was a little slow, but when you're with good company and having good conversation, that shouldn't bother you much.  I actually welcomed the slow pace as I hate feeling rushed.The food was spectacular.  We started with a few starters - the Brazino Lemon Ceviche, Sea Scallops & Truffle Artichoke Tapenade, and Fig Jamon Goat Cheese.  Brazino ceviche was good, but outshined by the sea scollops (favorite dish all night) and the fig prosciutto dish.  For our entrees we had the penne funghi tartufo and the rosemary lamb chops.  Penne was great - loads of mushrooms (almost same amount of mushrooms as pasta!)  and the perfect amont of truffle oil.  Scallions complimented the dish perfectly.  Lamb on the other hand was the one thing that disappointed all night.  it was definitely over cooked (we asked for medium rare), dry, and bland.  Was a total flop and we could have done without, however the other dishes made up for it!  Didn't take a good look at the drink menu but I had rasberry mojitos all night.  Declicious but definitely little to no alcohol, so doesn't justify the steep price tag. One of my new favorite restaurants and will be trying the other locations soon!",1,0,0,Lisa P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",97,169,97

The hostess immediately copped an attitude when I checked in and then she made us wait 15 minutes for our table and the waiter just plain sucked. He wasn't fit for Applebees.  Service notwithstanding, the food and atmosphere more than made up for the service. The fresh ceviche, cool cucumber soup, roasted chicken and lemon sole were all excellent. More impressive was the extensive and reasonably pricde wine list.  Be warned that the service is spotty, but the food is worth the risk.

1.0,9/8/2011,"This was my second visit here and was excited for an awesome meal. But from the very beginning, our waiter was very curt and appeared disinterested in waiting us. After our appetizers and entrees, any decent waiter would've asked if we would like a dessert menu. So I sit there waiting for him to come over with menus. Finally he comes over and asks ""Anything else?"" in a tone that was very curt and unfriendly.

3.0,8/22/2011,"Their NYC Restaurant week extended menu only applies to the Meatpacking location. I was going to order outside of that menu anyway, but I would've liked that option. I like that they bring out their rosemary bread with 3 different olive oils. I'm not an oil connoisseur, so I couldn't distinguish between them. Oh well. We ordered a bunch of Crostini's to share as well as the beef carpaccio. Beef carpaccio was nicely seasoned; I love the arugula along with their truffle olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The crostinis were nicely plated, and I got to try the salmon, crab, and shrimp. The crab crostini had a funny taste, which I handed off to my friend because well, I didn't want it. They forgot my salmon ceviche. Sad face. They must've predicted that we would be full and waste food. They were right. Bravo, clairvoyant waiter. Main course: Rosemary Lamb Chops. I got this as per a fellow yelper's recommendation. Surely, my dish was the best out of the table, but that's not saying much. The dish comes out with a cover, and as the waiter uncovers the glass, you're supposed to smell the aroma of burning rosemary sprigs and fall in love with the lamb presented in front of you. However, burnt rosemary? Not appetizing. The ""roasted eggplants"" were also burnt. My lamb did come out medium rare, which was a good thing. My 4 pieces of lamb were tiny in portion (for lamb, I recommend Pylos). I ordered Andrew's tasting and sharing plate which consists of 4 mini desserts. They gave me the wrong 4, but whatever. Dessert is dessert is dessert is dessert. Nothing really extraordinary. Drinks:1) Piscine - beautiful presentation, but lacking in flavor. 2) Cabernet - went well with my lamb, can't complain. 3) Moscato - THE BEST PART OF MY MEAL. They also overcharged us around $20+ more and the waiter came up with some excuse that didn't make sense; we debated and he came back with the correctly adjusted check, and still tried to save himself in argument. Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance, decor and the presentation of food. In fact, I might be suckered into going back, but to a different location.",2,1,0,Elsie W.,"Queens, NY",482,1737,4055

5.0,8/12/2011,"When scrolling through the list of restaurants participating in this year's summer restaurant week, the menu at Fig + Olive looked light, refreshing and refined. After wining and dining, I'm happy to say the restaurant's Riviera and Coastal cuisine didn't disappoint.Each dish was beautiful and all of the flavors were well defined and simple. The eatery touts its use of olive oil and did a wonderful job of highlighting its natural qualities.My Tuna Tartare was fresh with wonderful notes of citrus, while the Mediterranean Chicken Samosa was like an empanada--only better. Filled with chicken, cilantro, bell peppers and scallions, the Harissa Olive Oil and Greek yogurt brought a delightful richness to the flaky samosa. I only took a few bites of Jake's Grilled Steak Skewers and Couscous, but the meat was tender and deserved its place in the limelight. The skewer itself was actually a sprig of rosemary--a stroke of genius if you ask me. Jake couldn't get enough of the Greek yogurt and honey mixture, which kept the couscous with fig, red onion, scallion and tomato from being too dry. Of course, you can't forget the Koroneiki Olive Oil.  When it came time for me to order I completely butchered the name of my dish--Poulet Aux Legumes de Provence, a yummy mix of free range organic chicken breast, grilled zucchini, eggplant, heirloom tomato, cippollini onion, roasted fig, polenta, marinated red bell pepper and Frantoio Olive Oil.The chicken was cooked perfectly with a nice crispness to the skin. The polenta added a warm smokiness to the dish, while all of the varying textures and flavors of the vegetables gave the plate a rustic feel. I imagine this is what it's like to eat on the farm--well, if the farm happened to have a classically trained chef.When the Chocolate Pot de Creme came out I thought we'd gotten jipped. As Jake dipped his spoon in, however, the real chocolate emerged beneath the vanilla creme. I wish there was more of the crunchy praline financiers, but they were so delicious I'm lucky Jake even shared any at all.The Dessert ""Crostini"" absolutely blew my mind. The strawberry, mascarpone and pistachio on shortbread with micro-basil concoction was out-of-this-world good. Seriously. It wasn't too sweet and the mascarpone made the shortbread luscious and moist. The strawberries brought a brightness to each bite and I literally melted into my seat with pleasure.Fig + Olive is definitely my new favorite place to eat in NYC. I loved it so much I even went back for a wine and cheese tasting on Bastille Day. If given the chance to go, don't just say yes--say hell yes.",0,0,0,Victoria P.,"Astoria, NY",25,57,0

1.0,7/27/2011,"First let me say that I'm not a restaurant snob.  I'm more interested in spending quality time with friends and having a pleasurable dining experience.  That was not the case at Fig and Olive.The place was noisy and very chaotic. Tables are far to close to each other (you're almost dining with the neighboring table).  They had a huge waiter/bus staff buzzing by your seat constantly (with plates and trays passing very close to your head).  But that wasn't the serious issue ...We were seated for over 20 minutes and had not even been acknowledged by our waiter.  Remember, i said there was tons of staff flying by our table all the time - just not our waiter.  He finally appeared, frazzled and slightly aggravated (probably because we had complained to the management). He took our drink orders and delivered 2 out of 5 incorrectly.  Then he disappeared for another 20 minutes.  When he returned he was extremely abrupt in taking our order.  A few minutes later they FINALLY deliver some bread to our table (over 45 minutes after we had been seated),  BTW, the busboy with the water pitcher was on top of us every time we took a sip out of our glass - go figure.I'm not going to go on, because it just gets worse. In the end, 5 people were forced to shell out $350 for a poorly prepared meal served with horrible service.In closing, If you're looking for a mediocre dining experience, average food with less than adequate service - this restaurant does not even meet those standards.

3.0,7/25/2011,"The interior decorating of Fig & Olive is definitely on the better side compared to most restaurants but I would assume that it would be since it's located in the heart of midtown. I came here for restaurant week and ordered the tuna tartare, the seared tuna salad, and the crostinis. The tuna tartare was made extremely well with the best complementary toasted bread. I was a bit disappointed by the seared tuna salad because of the meager number of seared tuna and the itsy bitsy pieces of scallop that were littered all over the dish. If it had come with more meat I would've loved the light dressing but because I was still starving after this meal it made the dressing look really sad. It definitely made me want to drizzle the whole dish with some nice 1000 calorie Ranch dressing but hey, I'll keep it classy. The best part of what I ordered had to have been the sweet crostinis. The way the cookie crumbled in my mouth and the combination of the creme and strawberries really made me understand why dessert comes last.",0,0,0,Danielle K.,"New York, NY",215,233,43

Sadly, it wasn't that great to the both of us plus our other friends there. I ordered the Fig and Olive Mediterranean Tasting which gives a  small sample of 3 different dishes served as an entree for $30. The portion is kind of small and wasn't filling.

3.0,7/18/2011,"The main draw at Fig & Olive is the ambiance fostered by the romantic dim lighting, the pastel splashed interior, the dark metal vines that meander along the walls, and the rows and rows of flavored olive oil in beautiful glass bottles. It's classy and comfy at the same time.For those wanting to try the RW menu, it showcases the majority of Fig & Olive's entrees fairly well, although their specialty crostinis were left off of their appetizer list and their fish entrees were off limits. A disappointment to me.I ordered from the regular menu and had the gazpacho, a chilled tomato soup that was rather refreshing, with a surprise layer of parmesan pesto at the bottom of the cup. I'm not fond of parmesan so that wasn't a welcomed addition, but for those that do like it, prepare yourself for a pungent punch of tiny parmesan bits!The salmon was soft as requested (medium cooked) but lukewarm in temperature, which had me a bit concerned. The fennel was a great addition to the fish, but overly salted. The dish was unsalvageable at that point, because the sodium masked any natural flavors of the fennel and left me parched!My friends that had the pot de creme of chocolate and crunchy financier swooned.

I ended up getting the Tuna TarTar, Seafood Paella and the Dessert Crostini(fruit topped shortbread). They also gave complimentary bread with three assortments of dipping oils. While at first it looked like small portions, I felt content and not overally full by the end of the dinner. The food was delicious and definitely to my liking.

Sadly none of these were included for restaurant week, but I was very satisfied nonetheless. The best part was dessert, the Chocolate Pot de Creme, which was incredibly rich and perfectly portioned.

Granted, I hope I'm not paying the bill (teehee). While I was slightly disappointed with my lemon sole due to the lack of mashed potatoes in my entree and lack of strong lemon flavor, the tuna ceviche and desserts made up for it! I really enjoyed the cucumber flavor in the tuna ceviche. The mushroom and truffle oil crostini was also good along with the prosciutto and fig. Now for the desserts - OH MY GOD! They were SO good. We had the chocolate pots de creme and the marzipan cake topped with olive oil gelato. While the olive oil gelato disappointed due to lack of flavor, the rest of the dessert was fantastic.

For the main course, I had the truffle chicken paillard with the potatoes leek confit.  It was a small portion but I was satisfied.  My boyfriend had the seafood paella and he thought it was good but not as filling as he would have liked.  I had the warm apple tart for desert which was nice and not too heavy/greasy.  My boyfriend had the chocolate pot de creme which he loved but I thought was so rich it was impossible to eat even a single complete bite.",0,0,0,Kathleen M.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,12,0

2.0,4/18/2011,"The food and atmosphere are great  - I can tell you right away that the place does smell amazing when you walk in, and the atmosphere is lovely and chic without being too stuffy, the cocktails are delicious, and the appetizers (crostinis, the fig jamon tart!) were delicious.   Entrées are solid -- I enjoyed my branzino dish and my hungry coworkers thought the lamp chops, although portioned on the skimpy side considering it was $38, were perfectly cooked.  Desserts were great too - wonderfully decadent if you were in the mood for the chocolate souffle and sufficiently sweet and light if you went with the raspberry sorbet.  So why only a sad 2 stars?  The service.  It was really pretty awful for a nice midtown restaurant.  I was here most recently for a work dinner with 6 other coworkers and frankly feel as though this place let me down.  We were seated at a tiny table that could barely fit everyone.  That was the first problem.  Then the service issues kept coming -- we weren't given cocktail menus until we asked for them, and our waiter while he was attentive in the beginning kept disappearing.   Considering we were a table of 7 for an early dinner reservation (7pm) on a Wednesday, I didn't think we should have to flag him down for everything from getting menus to ordering and getting the check.  He also didn't really give recommendations as to good appetizers to share for a larger group.  Despite all the uncoordinated service, which I usually don't mind since I'm with good company and the food is delicious, the most unacceptable thing that happened that night was the fact that we were told right off the bat that they were out of scallops.  At  7pm on a busy weeknight?  Several people wanted to order the Trio del Mar, which would have included scallops.  I've had it before and the scallop was REALLY delicious.  We weren't offered substitutes for the scallop in that dish or anything.   But we didn't question it too much, people were flexible and opted to choose different things.  However, around 8:30 when we were finishing up entrées, on my way to the restroom I passed by a table close to ours where the waiter had just put down the Trio Del Mar dish.  It was definitely the same dish from the menu, which I recognized from having before, and there were definitely scallops.  I'm not sure why they lied to our table about not having scallops but that was truly unacceptable.  I guess it's possible that they somehow located a crate of scallops sometime between 7pm and 8:30pm, but even if I were to give them the benefit of the doubt, it seems like a stretch.  Some other reviews have characterized this place as a solid 3 stars, and I agreed with them before this experience.   Food can be pretty good, especially the appetizers and, if you choose correctly, the entrées can be well executed too.  It is a nice place to grab a drink and have something different from the steakhouses that are abundant in the area.   But honestly, after that disappointing experience, I have to say a large part of why this place survives despite the inconsistent and sometimes inconsiderate service is its convenient midtown location.",3,0,0,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

Red sangria & The Perfect Pair cocktails were pretty good. On the sweeter side for those who don't mind that. The prosciutto & fig crostini was good but found the mushroom & artichoke to be tastier. We had all 4 tartar/ceviche items and none were very good. I would have liked the flavors to be bolder and texture of some of the fish was a bit mushy. I would pass on this section of the menu and stick with the other appetizers and small plates. The fig & prosciutto tart was tasty. The combination of puff pastry, fig, prosciutto and peppery arugula worked for me. But what I enjoyed the most was the special entree of a grilled whole wild branzino stuffed with herbs. They fillet the fish table-side. I was pleasantly surprised at how seasoned the fish was and not just from the skin of the fish but throughout the fish.

Seared scallops were good too - but pretty on par with other good restaurants. My friend had the penne Funghi. It was all right. Nothing special. Paired with wine, it was alllll good.

3.0,3/15/2011,"I LOVE figs in any form and only marginally like olives unless however, they're in my martini, ground up in a tapenade or pitted and stuffed with something yummy. And btw, I definitely don't like olives on my pizza. With all of that said, we were looking for a spot that we could relax in, enjoy some light appetizers and some yummy libations served pitcher size while enjoying each other's company. Here's what transpired on a Sunday afternoon in mid-March:Pitcher sized libations:+ Red wine sangria. Their sangria was GOOD and it was just that. It was very heavy on the berries (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and raspberries) and provided for a refreshing mid-day drink. It was a bit sweet and didn't contain cinnamon or nutmeg which I think is integral for sangria success.Foodstuffs:+ Prosciutto, Ricotta, Fig, Olive and Walnut Crostini. So you're at the Fig and olive restaurant so it's basically required for you to order something with fig AND olive in it right? Yeah, well, so we did and it was a solid ""GOOD"" and just that. This bite was a texture explosion...fig preserves, crusty crostini, mushy ricotta, firm olives and stringy prosciutto..+ Manchego, Fig Spread, Almond Crostini. This crostini was another solid contender for being ""GOOD"" and once again, just that. It wasn't overly spectacular however the marcona almonds were the key to this item providing the much need nutty crunch.- Mushroom, Artichoke Truffle Parmesan Crostini. As you've noticed in the rest of my reviews of other foodstuff establishments, I love truffle anything. This sounded amazing as I had to order it...ahem, truffle. However it disappointed and was a flavor confusion/disaster- Mediterranean Chicken Samosa with chicken, cilantro, greek yogurt, bell pepper, scallion - Harissa Olive Oil. I'm Indian so I had to order this and see how well they could do a Mediterranean version of this dish. DISASTER. The Harissa olive oil did nothing except provide a nice burnt orange/red color to the dish, the cilantro and green yogurt was bland, the samosa were small and overly stuffed with ground up chicken. This is NOT the way to do samosa folks...and if you're trying to be trendy/fusiony, you failed.My summary on the Fig and Olive? As I've scored them at a solid 3 Yelps, it's a good spot to go and hang out at without spending a lot of money. I will return to one of their other locations to try a few other items but if my next visit proves to be another ""decent"" / 3 Yelp visit, I'll probably go elsewhere thereafter.THIS has been a review by Gaurav",1,1,1,Gaurav P.,"New York, NY",486,512,2436

4.0,2/22/2011,"I dined here during Winter 2011 Restaurant Week. My bf and I made reservations for a Friday night. We arrived earlier than expected and thought we'd get lucky, but ended up having to wait for our reserved time slot since they were so busy. This place was poppin'! There was a steady flow of people in and out of this location and this was clearly felt from the huge gusts of wind that kept hitting us from the door opening and closing as we were waiting inside. When our reservation time rolled around, we only had to wait 5-10 min before a table cleared up. We were seated upstairs right by the kitchen. It was pretty cool to see the chefs doing their thing in the back, but yet a little annoying to see and feel the dinner rush that the wait staff had to deal with. They were literally zipping by us back and forth like Flash. The restaurant had a nice ambiance to it. Dim lighting, candles on the walls, and nice décor. The only thing I didn't like was how cold it was upstairs for some reason. I couldn't figure it out if we were just seated underneath a vent or if the whole upstairs was cold. The waitress we had was ok. She didn't come around much to check on us, but the other staff were very much on top of refilling our waters and clearing the plates once we were done. We ordered off the Pre-fixe Dinner Menu ($35):Appetizer:Beef Carpaccio - this was thinly sliced marinated (Truffle Olive Oil) raw Beef drizzled with 18 y/o Balsamic Vinegar and topped with Parmesan and baby Arugula. It was my very first time trying Beef Carpaccio and I LOVED IT. The flavors came together so well. It was delicious! Portion size was just right. Spanish Vegetable Soup - this was a vegetable soup that had Lentils and Chorizo. It was good and hearty. I loved the added flavor from the Chorizo. Main Course: Grilled Truffle Chicken Paillard - free range Chicken Breast marinated with Thyme served with Truffle Mashed Potato Leek Confit in White Truffle Olive Oil and herbs. This was very good. The Chicken was moist, tender, and perfectly seasoned. The Truffle Mashed Potato Leek Confit was delicious also, my only wish was that there was a bigger serving of it! I felt the serving size of this dish was a tad bit small. 10 oz. Grilled Filet Mignon ($8 extra) - grass fed Beef, marinated with Rosemary, Thyme, and Garlic. Served with sautéed String Bean, caramelized Shallot, roasted fingerling Potato and Shallot. This was absolutely delicious. The bf had this and I had to hold myself back from eating his entire plate. The Filet Mignon was juicy and so flavorful!Dessert: Chocolate Pot De Crème - a little pot with extremely rich Chocolate topped with Vanilla cream. This was accompanied with crunchy Praline Financiers. The Pralines provided a change in texture which went very well with the very decadent chocolate pudding. Unfortunately it was SO RICH that neither my bf or I could finish it. Dessert ""Crostini"" - Amarena Cherry, Mascarpone, Pistachio on shortbread with micro-basil. This was sooo good! The crunch from the shortbread, the sweetness from the Cherry, the counterbalance from the Mascarpone .. it all came together to create a delicious dessert. Overall, we had a delicious meal.

As I stated earlier I went for restaurant week and on the menu there was an option for an additional $8 to order the Lamb Chops.  If you are into lamb highly recommend this.  The presentation alone was fantastic.  I always am a little iffy of ordering lamb chops because I have done in the past and been disappointed with either the amount of chops or the size of them.  This wasn't the case for either.  Out came a dish covered in a clear bowl and inside were the chops and a semi-lit piece of rosemary so when the waiter lifted the bowl the aroma was amazing.  There were 4 nice sized lamb chops, cooked perfectly (I like med rare).  It was placed on a bed of goat cheese mash potatoes which were so so, not crazy about it and eggplant roasted with thyme and honey which were good and cooked to make them nice and soft. Dessert...one word..yum!!  It was some type of chocolate mousse with a whip cream on top.  It was just great, I don't know what else to say about it.   I am a huge chocolate fan and finished it within seconds.  If you are looking to try this place and have been waiting, I would go now while you can for restaurant week and try it out because you are getting a great meal for a really great place.  The menu had a lot of great choices and for the price was worth it.  I made RSVP and was seated up stairs away from the noisy downstairs so if you are going on a date I would recommended requesting the upstairs.",0,0,0,marc s.,"Jamaica, NY",32,78,163

I got to the restaurant early and nursed a glass of white wine until my friend arrived. We were promptly seated and supplied with menus and waters. But we weren't given any bread and olive oil when we sat down. I had to flag down the waiter and ask for it. He looked at me funny. What? You're supposed to give that to us without being asked... On the recommendation of another friend, we ordered from their prix fixe menu. For appetizers, I had the Mediterranean Chicken Samosas and my friend got the Zucchini Carpaccio. The samosas were delicious! It was flavorful; the crust was flaky and the inside was warm and gooey. I really enjoyed it. My only complaint is that there were only two small pieces. I think I could have put away about five of those. My friend's zucchini was nice; she seemed to enjoy it. The olive oil, pines and shaved parmesan complemented the fresh zucchini slices. However, if it hadn't been a part of the prix fixe menu, I don't think either of us would've ordered it. At $12, it seems a little steep for a few slices of zucchini topped with olive oil, pine nuts and cheese. For our entrees, I had the Grilled Truffle Chicken Paillard and my friend had the Grilled Lamb Skewers and Couscous. My chicken came in the shape of a heart, over a bed of mashed potato and leek confit. It was cute. It tasted all right. The chicken was moist, but some parts were a little tough. The flavors didn't really wow me. My friend's lamb skewers were quite good though. The lamb was cooked nicely and the rosemary was fragrant, but not overpowering. For dessert, I had the Chocolate Pot de Creme and my friend decided to try the Dessert Crostini. The waiter was nice enough to stick a candle on my friend's dessert; it was a pleasant end to our meal. I enjoyed my dessert; the chocolate was very rich, though it might be overwhelming for people who are not huge chocolate fans. My friend really like her crostini dessert, but though the bed of micro greens underneath was strange. Overall, a nice dining experience. I don't know if I'd ever come back though. I think there are better restaurants out there.",2,0,1,Christy C.,"Bellevue, WA",79,147,153
3.0,1/9/2011,"This is a solid 3.5 stars. It is pricey but the food is good and a bit unique. I had the scallops and the Fig and Olive Salad. The scallops were actually amazing with this like mushroom hash drizzled with truffle. The salad was okay- it was fresh and the ingredients were good as were the flavors but there was something missing. I can't put my finger on it tho. My friends both had the Lemon Sole which was served in a wonderful bag that they open in front of you- very cool! The reason I didn't rate it higher is it is not cheap- every drink is over $12, and the food was expensive too. The service was also not fantastic- the restaurant was empty but it took almost 40 minutes to bring our food out....",0,0,0,Samantha K.,"Manhattan, NY",363,33,1

It gets a 4 for the setting: full of well dressed European tourists who were taking a break from dropping big money on 5th Avenue and local, wealthy New Yorkers in their mid-30s who were looking for a quick, casual lunch; decorated with rustic chic furniture and smelling slightly of fresh rosemary. The food is only a three because I had a very average grilled chicken salad - it came with raw onions, a sliver of avocado, raw peppers and two overcooked, under-salted potato wedges. Ho-hum.

2.0,8/5/2010,"I was going to give this place a solid 3 but looking back and reading other people's reviews made me realize I would be too generous doing so.I ended up here for dinner with a friend yesterday. We didn't have a reservation but they quickly showed us to a table which seriously looked like they just quickly and randomly set up for us since it was against the wall upstairs and basically blocking the walkway. We were really confused about this since the place at the time was practically scarce (at around 6:30pm) and granted by the time we left, a good portion was filled up but there were still many tables to be filled! We even asked if we could change our seats but we just got a quick and resounding no. This basically established our experience for the rest of the evening. To note, we ordered from the restaurant week menu. In terms of our food experience, here's the breakdown:Bread: The waiter quickly brought over some bread and a sampling of olive oil which was a nice touch.Appetizer: We both got the chicken samosa that was complemented with a tasty greek yogurt sauce. The chicken samosas (2 per person) were just a pastry filled w/ a ground chicken mixture. I did find a corn kernel though so I'm assuming it was ground with vegetables but I also found a piece of cartilage which was a negative. My friend thought it was her favorite dish however and loved it. I thought it was just meh.Main course: We both got the cod. I asked the waiter if the penne was better or the cod and he briskly (a common theme throughout the dinner btw) said the cod. I seriously wish I ordered the penne instead. Thinking back on it now, I really thought he said cod just because fish doesn't take long to cook and he could get our dishes out faster.  First, it came in a bowl. Why? I mean who's idea was that really? Not easy to actually cut things up and pick them up at all. Second, the balsamic sauce was waaayy too strong. Third, they just threw in the most random vegetables you could think of. In short, none of the ingredients complemented one another, the presentation was bad, and the entire idea was just basically lazy. Dessert: I got the dessert crostini. It was okay. The mini strawberries were an interesting touch but the cream was tasteless and the crostini was just whatever. My friend got the chocolate option. That to me was better. The chocolate was served in basically a small coffee cup (again why??) but the consistency was good.Now let's get down to the worst part of our dining experience. The waitstaff. I have never in my life been so rushed to finish a meal. Our waiter wasn't blatantly being a bitch or anything, but they took away our plates before we could even blink. Several times throughout our meal, we were witness to blatant hatred between the waitstaff and busboys. They would intentionally hit into each other while serving people's plates, curse at each other, and start fights right in front of the diners! It was completely unprofessional. Going back to being rushed, they waiters were ridiculously rushing all over the place. I do not have any explanation for this whatsoever! You don't need to serve the food within a second of each course and you don't need to tell us time and time again if we wanted drinks. Or ask us if we wanted anything else AFTER we paid the check which is an obvious way of telling us to leave. It got so uncomfortable, we did leave earlier than we wanted to.  Seriously, this dampened my experience so much that I can't understand why anyone would come here. There was a poor attempt at complexity with their dishes and the experience overall made me feel so unwelcome. Maybe the other locations are better, I don't know, but all I can say is DON'T eat here.",0,0,0,Anjela D.,"Great Neck, NY",4,39,0

We arrived at 12:45pm on a week day and the restaurant was quite busy, but thankfully, since we had a reservation, we were seated right away.We each ordered the $27 pre fixe menu and it came with 3 courses. Before our food came out, they gave us bread with 3 different kinds of olive oil, with each of them from a different region of the world.

It was quite tasty and quite refreshing because it's chilled.

My date and I started off with the tuna carpaccio, which was very fishy--a bad way to start off our meal. Though this is something we would never normally do, it was something we simply could not enjoy. We asked our waiter to send back the dish, in which he responded, ""let met get my manager"". Really? Why not take the dish back and ask if there is anything else he could do (i.e, have us order something else). The manager apologized, asked if we wanted to put in another appetizer order, and never brought the menu back for us to consider doing so. Another definite no-no in my book. I ordered the artichoke/crab meat and ricotta cheese ravioli, which was nothing great, my date ordered the penne funghi, which was good, and we shared the trio de la mer (a tasting of their seared scallop, branzino, and salmon). The trio de la mer was the best thing that we ate, but if you're going to order it as a main course, its best to add on extra appetizers, crostinis, or a salad, because it is SLIM pickings. Service was slightly slow, but the cocktail menu is fun and the drinks were well made. All in all, I was rather disappointed.

However, the shrimp and scallop paella was basically 2 shrimps, 2 scallops, over a scoop of rice with corn and tomato sauce. Not very pleasing. My friend and I went for restaurant week dinner the other night and just had an awful experience. We looking for a relaxing dinner, and relaxed was not how we felt when we left. Yes, I know it was restaurant week which is synonymous for less service, but don't restaurants sign up voluntarily for this?None of the waiters or food runners asked if we were finished with the bread and our first plates before snatching them away (we weren't finished). This set the tone for how the rest of the meal would flow. We were encouraged to settle the bill before we were even done with dessert. The waiter then told us 'Thank you, have a good evening"" even though we still had more than half a bottle of wine left and our desserts.  Shortly after, the manager on shift motioned for the waiter get the ball rolling with hand gestures. The waiter stopped next to our table and filled our glasses to the brim with the rest of the bottle. It wasn't long after that the waiter stopped again, said, ""Thank you again"" and cleared the entire table while we were still sitting! All that was left was one glass of wine that was still more than half full. My friend was left to sit there as if she were drinking alone. She was so embarrassed that she quickly asked me to help her finish her wine so we could leave. The feeling that resonated was a dinner guest who over-stayed their welcome.Now, had there been a long line waiting to be seated, I could understand if the waiter stopped to explain the situation and we would have gladly taken our drinks to the bar. However, there were a few empty tables surrounding us. I would hope that if there weren't enough time to enjoy a bottle of wine, the waiter would discourage customers from ordering a bottle.

2.0,7/27/2010,"My cousin was in town and staying her family's pied-a-terre (just barely) on West 53rd.  I knew she would be jetlagged and not wanting to travel far so I decided to try Fig and Olive, having heard some positive things about it from friends (though mostly from the Meatpacking District location).We didn't have a reservation, but when we came in around 8:45 pm on a Monday, were easily seated way in the back near the kitchen.  Normally, I might mind this, but it actually provided us with more space than you usually get at a NYC restaurant since there wasn't another table squished on one side of us.Everything was OK...not great (though there's some potential), but just OK.  Menus were placed in front of us, though nothing was said about them...not even anything highlighting the Restaurant Week menu (which I am guessing they decided to extend since I believe it ended the Friday before).  And throughout the meal, we never got truly personal service.  The waitress was bland.  I don't think she even asked how we were or if we had any questions.  She recited the three different olive oils that accompanied the bread so quietly, you could barely hear her.  Another person delivered at least one course (our entrees, though to his credit, he did know which person order what item).  And one time, the waitress disappeared for so long that we had to summon a busboy (which I hate doing) to find her so my companion could order another drink.My friend had two raspberry mojitos during the meal and seemed to enjoy them.  I had two glasses of the Gascogne - Domaine d'Uby, Sauvignon Blanc from their decent, but pricey wine list.  I think that it was one of the cheapest options at $10/glass.Both my companion and I had the cucumber ""carpaccio.""  In reality, it isn't anything that one couldn't make at home (assuming you had cucumber, olive oil, parmeggiano reggiano, and pine nuts), but it was beautifully presented and quite tasty.  My friend had a fish entree (Forgive me, I forget the details, but think it was cod).  I tasted a small bite and the fish was fresh and flaky.  I had what was titled on the menu as ""shrimp and scallop paella.""  I LOVE paella and was so looking forward to this.  What came out did taste good, but it wasn't paella in the slightest (which crushed me a bit).  The very lightly saffron-flavored rice didn't get that crustiness on it (because it wasn't made in a paella pan) and just sat on the plate (placed there in a ring mold, I am guessing) with two little scallops and two shrimp on top.  The protein was good and fresh, but it was just hanging out on top and not incorporated into the dish in any way.  Sigh.  Seafood and rice, yes.  Paella...not on your life.For dessert, my companion had the Dessert Crostini, three little divine pieces with wonderfully fresh strawberries, a bit of mascarpone, touch of balsamic, atop a little shortbread.  I had the Chocolate Pot de Creme.  The chocolate custard was wonderful, rich, and not too sweet.  The creme on top was a bit flavorless...and definitely not the ""Crunchy Praline Financier"" that was promised.  There was nothing crunchy and texturally different about the dish.  But despite its shortcomings, it was still tasty.  And I had a perfectly fine cup of coffee.It was a lovely meal that ended up somewhere in the neighborhood of $125-ish total, a bit pricier than it should have been due to the wine mark up and the sadness that was my un-paella.  But it was a nice meal and a calm (and really beautiful, rustically decorated) establishment.  I'd give it another try.  It does have some good food, minus the few misses, and bland waitress.  I wish I could give 2.5 stars though.  It wasn't quite ""A-OK,"" but just ""OK"" for me this time.",0,0,0,Kristin C.,"New York, NY",9,90,0

My friend got the penne with truffle oil and mushrooms, which was delicious. I should have gotten that instead. The wait staff is very polite, although a new employee spilled a glass of water near our table and some of it got on one of my friends.

True, the prices are great, especially for the location off 5th Ave. Portion size was to be expected - regular, fine dining sizes. The drinks were sad. The restaurant has a huge bar, but my cocktail was weak, overly sweet, and enormous. I would have preferred a smaller drink that was higher quality. The starter, some white bread and three different olive oils, was also just OK. The oils were amazing, but the bread was a huge letdown. It was so bland and dry that it almost overpowered the oil. Can a bland taste overpower something? Well, it did. I started with the tuna tartare, which was a bit boring. It was fresh, yes, but the tastes could have been pushed so much further. I followed this with the branzino, was was tasty but the edges were a bit overcrisped. They were thin pieces of fish, which I know is nearly impossible to cook well, so I can cut them some slack here. The figs that accompanied it were tasty, but oh so tiny. I guess I expected plumper figs, haha. The dessert was chocolate pot du creme. Delicious, but it couldn't save the meal.

Why in the world would they refuse to do that?Anyway, the person paying for the meal overheard the conversation and finally got them to let me pick the other pasta off the menu (some kind of Mediterranean one with tomatoes).

4.0,3/15/2010,"I was pretty impressed with this place - we came in a group of four for a birthday on a Friday night. We had a 8:30 PM reservation, but were very accommodating when we were half an hour late, and had to wait for another person to arrive.The decor is nice and the atmosphere was great. The tables are somewhat close together, and at first, it seems very bustling. However, once you sit down, it becomes very clear that each table has it's own separate atmosphere, and would be ideal for both business luncheon/dinner or romantic date. The dress here was casual elegant.Our waitress was very accommodating, and water service came at appropriate times without seeming to intrude upon our conversation. We started off with a quick olive oil tasting, and the descriptions she gave of the three different oils were true to taste.After asking for recommendations, the waitress first recommended the Prix Fixe menu ($36), although the most expensive out of all individual choices, seems to be a great deal for the money (included appetizer, main course, and dessert). Then, she recommended sampler dishes (both $28), which most of us settled upon. I had the Trio de la Mer (seafood), while two of my friends had the Fig & Olive Mediterranean Tasting (meat). The overall theme of this restaurant is to have a particular olive oil featured in each dish.When the dishes came, many would get the impression that the portions are somewhat small. However, the portions were perfect, allowing room for dessert later. The presentation of each dish was gorgeous.The Fig & Olive Mediterranean Tasting dish came with the following:- Grilled free range chicken with rosemary & garlic, porcini puree - Porcini Olive Oil - Grilled lamb on rosemary skewers, bell peppers, Greek yogurt & honey, couscous salad with figs - Grilled shrimp & tomato skewer on a saffron rice - Oregano Olive OilMy dish, the Trio de la Mer, came with the following:- Mediterranean branzino, glazed with fig & aged balsamic vinegar, snow peas & figs- Seared sea scallop, artichoke truffle tapenade, mushroom - Truffle Oil- Seared salmon marinated with pimenton & thyme on broccoli puréeI started off with the scallop, which was slightly heavy on the salt. Otherwise, it was very tasty with a bit of the tapenade on the side.  I then moved onto the branzino (a white meat fish) which was seared, and cooked perfectly. It was delicious, but seemed like any standard white meat fish fillet. I thought the salmon was the best (maybe a slight bias on my part, as I'm rather partial to salmon), and the broccoli puree was amazing. The salmon was tender, and the puree added a great twist to the fish when coupled together.Each of the dessert averaged $8, but we opted to have dessert elsewhere.The waitress gave us our bill, and was very patient while we conversed (actually, we started discussing calculus and started using the receipts for proofs). We were allowed to take our time, and in no way did we ever feel rushed.Overall, I'm very happy with this restaurant and would not mind bringing family or friends here again.",0,0,0,Tinya C.,"Durham, NC",57,92,233
4.0,3/8/2010,"I was impressed with this place. I went here for a bday dinner this past saturday. We had 5 people, and we were seated on a table near the bar that was like a counter top. It looked like it was originally part of the bar and they sectioned it off and added stools to make it a table. I had a glass of the Burgunday Pinot Noir. It was light and flavorful. I liked how it came in a mini carafe and then the waiter poured it into my wine glass. For an appetizer, 3 of us shared 1/2 dozen assorted oysters of Malpec, Blue Point, and Fanny Bay. I had a Blue Point and another oyster i don't recall. They both tasted very fresh, and I liked the sauces that came with the oysters. They provided complimentary bread with 3 different types of olive oils from different areas. I wasn't able to hear which came from which, but each had their own distinct flavor, and I liked all 3. For entrees, my friends and I ordered all bunch of sorts. They have a solid menu. The birthday girl ordered the Porcini & Fig Jamon Iberico Ravioli. Her friend ordered The Trio De La Mar. They ran out of Branzino, so they substituted the fish with another kind, I am not sure which. My other two friends ordered the  Tuscan Caramelized Cod & Garden Vegetables and the Grilled Lamb Skewers & Couscous.I myself ordered the Fig&Olive Mediterranean Tasting. It came with grilled boneless chicken with a garlic, porcini puree. A grilled lamb on rosemary skewer, bell peppers, yogurt, and couscous with figs. It also came with a grilled shrimp & tomato on another rosemary skewer over saffron rice.  The chicken was very moist, tender and flavorful. The porcini puree was average at best. The grilled lamb was cooked rare so it was a bit tough (I didn't get to tell the waiter how i wanted my lamb). The lamb was flavorful with the hint of rosemary. The bell peppers were cooked unevenly. The yogurt was okay, but the couscous salad with figs was really yummy. The grilled shrimp was good. They deveined it and got rid of the tail. The tomatoes were grilled well so it added more sweetness to its part of the dish. The saffron rice was also very yummy.For dessert, we ordered the Warm Chocolate Souffle for the birthday girl. It was a nice surprise that we ordered as she went to the bathroom. We asked the manager to add some candles to the cake which they were happily to oblige with the request. The waiters came with the cake and sang happy birthday. Yes we embarrassed the bday girl but it was all in fun. The cake was very gooey and rich in the inside. It oozed chocolatey goodness as you broke the surface. The vanilla ice cream really mellowed the flavor out since it was chocolatey. The dish itself was huge for one person. I think it would have been nicer if it was like a cupcake size instead the size of a soup bowl. Will i come back here again? You betcha. The food was good, and the menu looks extensive.

4.0,2/6/2010,"We ate here for lunch during restaurant week.  The food was good and a good value for the discounted price!  For the  app, I had chicken samosas which were lightly fried to perfection.  I chose the scallop and shrimp paella for my main, which was ok - skimpy on the seafood and a bit too sticky for my taste.  For dessert I selected the chocolate pot de creme - what a decadent delight!  My roommate had the rotisserie chicken which had great flavor and was perfectly moist.  I didn't like her appetizer or dessert though (salmon mousse and a tart cherry crostini).  The service was actually too fast - we felt rushed.  There was almost no lag time between each dish, which if you were on a lunch break would probably be a plus, but we had just arrived to NYC and were looking for a more leisurely fare.  Plus it took awhile for us to get coffee and refills during dessert.  Overall, good but I wouldn't come here without some type of discount.  The food was good, but not good enough to pay $20 per dish for lunch.",0,0,0,Deann G.,"Baltimore, MD",2,47,0

3.0,1/31/2010,"I came here for Restaurant Week lunch and ordered the salmon mousse, truffle oil penne, and dessert crostini. My favorite out of those 3 was probably the dessert since the salmon mousse was too salty (but very light, flurry, and beautifully presented) and the penne was lacking imagination. Should have gone with the filet mignon for entree. The dessert crostini had like a cherry cream paste spread on crumbly graham crackers and was topped with whole cherries. A little too sweet but yum!

4.0,1/31/2010,"Walking through the rustic wooden doors, I was hit by loud music and the reverberating chatter in the background, but being directed to the dining area upstairs I realized that I underestimated what dinner would be like. The drink menu is notable they have champagne floats and raspberry bellinis along with a decent selection of wines. Given that I came during the RW rush and being a friday evening, the service staff wasn't particularly all too cheery when a friend asked for milk and sugar for her tea, and then proceeded to ask for a second cup; our waiter glowered. But the food was great! Started off with the salmon tartar and a salmon mousse, followed by veal. The veal so tender, my ethical friend who vows to not eat it for moral reasons even asked me for a sliver! The winning entree I must say was the filet mignon was a pad of olive oil sage infused butter. It left a savory richness to it.

4.0,12/15/2009,"We went there last weekend and couldn't have been more surprised - pleasantly, that is. Our rather last minute 'open table' reservation worked like a charm and we were seated immediately - impressive for a Saturday night. We opted for several of the Crostinis - seemingly you just can't do no wrong there, they were all just delicious and the '6 for $18' is actually pretty reasonable for what you're getting. Drink wise, we had Mojitos - tasty, but, like most NYC restaurants, a bit too pricey for the amount of drink that you get (same glass as the water glasses, $12/each). Also tried the Salmon Mojo and Sesame Tuna Tartar as well as the Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio. The Carpaccio was just straight up forgettable and very disappointing - barely any fish and just way too much green to inflate the plate and suggest a quantity that just wasn't there - avoid. On the tartars, my favorite was the Salmon Mojo - the flavors just came together a lot more than the also rather mediocre Sesame Tuna one. Lastly, we tried a very interesting baked puff pastry/cheese/tomato/salad goodie (I don't recall the name and it's not on the menu online for some reason) - also very, very delicious. While we felt a little underwhelmed by the dessert menu, we will definitely come back for more very, very soon. Very solid four stars here - for five stars, I would have needed to see either a bigger or cheaper drink, much better quality on the Carpaccio and just a bit more attention from our very polite and pleasant waiter.",1,0,1,Manuel C.,"Austin, TX",34,57,5

You had me drooling over the photos of your food and I can remember the anxiety going on in my head over what type of direction I would go in, tarts? crostinis? a plethora of appetizers? or a tasty main course dish?I was lucky enough to be taken here by my Boyfriend and his generous Boss. We sat down and ordered a glass of wine (which took awhile to actually arrive)We started out with Fig Gorgonzola Tartlet and the Ceviche & TarTar (a variety of 4). The tartlet was very sweet yet savory and I love TarTar but found it to be a bit bla (aside from the Branzino) For our main course I had the  TRIO DE LA MER  which I must say was 10x better in taste and display than what the others had ordered. We also ordered dessert but it was nothing special.Overall, I would say it is a 3.5 stars.

2.0,7/19/2009,"Just want to give a quick review without going much into details:The food, despite the presentations, has a very ""bleh"" taste and inconsistent quality. There is an apparent lack of attention and care to the cooking; only cold and uncooked (and relatively simple to prepare) dishes came out the way they are expected to (e.g. beef carpaccio), or even if--the desserts were also ""bleh"".  It left us rather unsatisfied. For those who go kaka over that bread/three olive oil dipping: please go check your local italian deli. You'll probably find not only better tasting extra virgin dipping oils in bewildering variety with very affordable prices, but also far tastier bread to dip with. It's hardly worth writing home about.The service has been horrendous: can't even get a server to *respond* to my request to refill my water even after saying it to his face TWICE (and yes he heard me), never mind getting him to actually doing it; the entree came out lukewarm after over 30 minutes of wait and a request to rush, and the plates were served to the wrong diners.I observed that the younger customers were more agreeable and forgiving than the servers, perhaps charmed by the location and decor? I imagine if one has any critical demand over his dining experience (for business or personal reasons), this place simply wouldn't pass the test: i.e. it would be embarrassing.The decor is hip, but the lighting was uneven with some tables left in uncomfortable darkness, and the dining area wasn't ideally laid out and was too noisy. It appears to have the pretense to garner the price without the substance to indulge the experience or palette.Meh.

4.0,6/29/2009,"During a recent business trip, I was determined to spend my one night in NYC on a good restaurant - nothing pricey or trendy, but just some place good with decent pricing. When some colleagues raved about Fig and Olive, I was open to all the possibilities. I loved this location as it was close to my hotel. The vibe was upbeat and festive, not cramped or stuffy and small like most eateries. The staff was attentive and helpful as well. I ordered the Tuna Carpaccio - absolutely tasty and refreshing! Fresh tuna can truly transcend cultures and cuisine techniques. The fish was presented perfect thinness, drizzled with a wonderful aged balsamic vinegar dressing, topped with roasted nuts and herbs. I then chose the grilled Branzino with fig and balsamic. The snow peas and fresh figs finished off the grilled fish and 18 yr aged vinegar perfectly. Yes, my appetizer was also a fish with balsamic, but the preparation and fish were completely different yet so complementary to each other. I finished off my meal with a berry and fresh ice cream bowl. Also, very refreshing and a great finish to a tasty meal. I decided to try the Dirty Martini and boy, was it good! Extra dirty, almost filthy, but strong and savory! I liked the fact that there was a variety of olives in the drink - nice!

3.0,6/17/2009,"I spent much of last summer in the Mediterranean and had a newfound love for the food. I went to Fig & Olive with a few family members and had already picked out off the menu prior to going there, what I was going to eat. I shared the Tuscan Salad (prosciutto, parmesan, fresh ricotta basil pine nut tapenade, olive tapenade, marinated eggplant warm olive oil toasts, tomato, artichoke, arugula salad, fig balsamic vinegar - frantoio olive oil) which was delicious. Especially the fresh ricotta basil pine nut tapenade! For my entree I had the Penne Mediterraneo shrimp, tomato, garlic, cilantro, scallion - spicy sundried tomato olive oil (without shrimp) and it was very delicious. Lots of flavors and yumminess. The food was very good.Loved the ambiance of the restaurant, just a cool vibe (minus that in the 1 1/2 hours of being there, they changed the lighting THREE times, um, huge pet peeve). Two complaints. When we received our appetizers, we asked for extra plates (because of 4 of us, we were sharing two salads) and they brought us bread plates. The waiters were very difficult to understand and didn't seem to understand us in wanting a bigger plate. FINALLY after I had picked at the salad so much already, they brought other plates. Other complaints--the bathroom was upstairs. Why would people want to go to the bathroom UPSTAIRS when you're eating downstairs? Just kinda inconvenient. Again, food was very yummy (everyone else enjoyed their food as well) but there were definitely some drawbacks",0,0,1,Harper S.,"New York, NY",546,426,7
3.0,5/21/2009,"My dad loves Mediterranean food, so I took him to Fig and Olive because I heard very good things about the menu. Granted, the clientele at Fig and Olive is on the young side, and for an upscale restaurant in the very traditional Midtown area, it's a pretty trendy place. But still, even though my dad (who is not an old guy by the way!) was one of the oldest patrons there, it's no reason for the staff and maitre d' to treat him rudely. Because that's the vibe I got. My dad is the kind of person who's very nonchalant about this though, but it irked me. The service was so slow. We were waiting 45 minutes for salads, which I find unacceptable. We had an excellent bottle of wine - Capezzana Barco Reale di Carmignano (2005). Despite all my gripes with the stuck-up service, the food was delicious. I like that the menu changes from season to season and that there are always such interesting choices. We ordered an assortment of olives to start off the meal and they weren't doused in oil and they had the perfect firmness. The three varieties of olive oil and the bread were also very good. The salmon carapaccio was amazing - not overly salty and very fresh. The jamon serrano salad was phenomenal - there was plenty of manchego cheese, tomato, and onion. For dessert, the apple tartlet was the perfect way to finish the meal - not overly sweet and the pastry portion had the right texture. Throughout the meal, it was near-impossible to get the attention of our waiter and we also had to wait 15 minutes to get the check (I love taking my time throughout dinner, but I also have a problem when the waiter isn't there when I actually need him and dinner was pushing 3 hours at this point). Even though I had made a reservation 3 days in advance, we were seated in the back of the restaurant, extremely close to the kitchen, which I was annoyed about. The food gets five stars, but because of the obnoxious service I received, I'm scaling back. I've been toying around with the idea to return because the food is excellent considering all of the overpriced, marginal restaurants in Midtown but I just can't justify returning somewhere with such lackluster service.",2,1,1,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

The food itself was all right - the crostinis were much smaller than expected for us to share around the table, but I guess the size of the entrees compensated for that somewhat.

When we came in with a party of four the palce was pretty busy, so we decided to check out the bar and have a drink and look over the brunch menu. When we sat down the bartender, who we later learned was one of the managers brought over an olive oil plate of three different oils, I think one was from spain, one from greece maybe...well...all three were good. He explained how they all were different and told us about how they were all also avalible in the restuarant. After looking over the menu, we decieded to sit down for brunch and try it out. They were pretty full so the hostess politely told us it would be about 5 to ten minutes before they could accomodate. While we waited, the bartender stroke up conversation telling us about the owner and concept. All of which made sence. If you stop by definetly ask...it can describe why theres no butter in anything and you leave feeling refreshed and not famished.Our server was pretty attentive even with business going around and the food was well seasoned, brunch food.I had the italian Omlette with pancetta and Mozz, theres an option to add a few more things, but I was content. It came out well seasoned in part due to the pancetta and you could tell it had a little salt and pepper. the potato fries were good and the greens were dressed with some type of olive oil and fig vinaigrette.My girlfriend had the Spanish casoulette (sp?) she said it was really good and the spicyness from the chorizo was offset by the sweetness in the fig jam. Kudos.The couple we went with, Andrew and Mike both had salads, sans the poached egg. They liked. Overall I think the atmosphere was great, the food came out quick and we werent so cramped next to obnoxious people that we had a great time. The foods no bernadin or per se, but its clean and seasoned, so when you eat your full, but you leave not feeling blated. I dont know how to explain it. Delish.Pros: Desserts!, Poached egg option, Options in omlette choices, large wine by the glass list, service and polite friendly staff.Cons: Casoulette takes 15 minutes, so order the omlette its better.Place gets really busy so either call ahead or make a reservation.

3.0,1/23/2009,"This is a good spot for something quick and light!! Small plates that are filling, different tastes combined in one plate, a good selection of wine...the only catch is that the place is small, tables are too close to each other, it can get loud very easily in the back room, and of course service is lacking!! Love the first sampler page of the menu, cheese selections with fig on the side are awesome... also tried the chicken salad last time i was there - wouldn't try that again!",0,0,0,Olivia F.,"New York, NY",0,13,0
4.0,1/21/2009,"Just recently had a work group lunch there and was very impressed.  I had been down to the meatpacking fig and olive for drinks and enjoyed myself there, but never had a chance to try the food.We all ordered from the restaurant week prix fixe menu and everyone really enjoyed their meal.I had the Chicken Samosa and Penne Funghi Tartufo.  Both were delicious, though the pasta dish was a bit too much to finish in one sitting.  For desert Sorbet w/ a cookie and some coffee.I would go back for lunch or for drinks... i don't get a very ""dinnerish"" vibe from this place, but it seems like a great place to get drinks and some apps.  The bread and olive oils are also very tasty.",2,0,1,Catie B.,"Charlotte, NC",40,30,3
4.0,1/6/2009,"As an olive oil connoisseur (or at the least, a huge fan), I am completely on board with Fig & Olive's food philosophy: prepare every dish with one of the finest olive oils of the Mediterranean region. Fittingly, the restaurant's light, airy ambience and décor create a European feel. While dining here recently, I was served a complimentary tasting of three virgin olive oils before my meal. I later discovered that if you like any of the oils, you can buy them right there in the restaurant ""store"" (a small counter in the back rather than an obtrusive tourist attraction a la Tavern on the Green's gift shop).  As an appetizer, I had artichoke and fig crostini (the menu offers an assortment of crostini -- small, thin slices of bread topped with various ingredients). The wait staff recommended the Tilapia as an entrée, and it didn't disappoint. Only recently did I learn that they have a Mediterranean tasting for only $28, so I will certainly be back. Maybe next time I'll check out Fig & Olive's downtown counterpart at West 13th Street (Ninth Avenue and Washington Street).",0,0,1,Cara C.,"San Diego, CA",8,20,0
4.0,12/4/2008,"Fig & Olive 5th Ave - as they call themselves, although they're on 52nd and Madison - is great for lunch but not so much dinner. I've been there twice. Once for lunch with a colleague and it was great. We had an assortment of the crostinis, which are to die for! I had one of their salads and my friend had a seafood dish. The food was very tasty, very well presented. The waiter was very knowledgeable but a bit socially-awkward... not sure if he was intimidated by our good looks or if we  were so repulsive that he couldn't look at us in the eye. Overall a great experience for lunch.My second visit to the 5th-Ave-address-wanna-have restaurant, was okay. Again, amazing crostinis and wine selection was decent. However, they managed to mess up a basic Mediterranean dish... pasta!! The white sauce, which I think was an Alfredo, was simply BAD! I was sooo disappointed! :(Aside from my bad experience there, it is overall a cute place for lunch and a casual dinner, possibly even a casual 3rd or 4th date (if he/she makes it that far). ;-)",0,0,1,Juni D.,"New York, NY",30,191,35
4.0,11/30/2008,"I loved the food and the wine. The decor is elegant and moderately aesthetic. The presentation was beautiful- I especially loved the prosciutto with figs and goat cheese. That is a must! The entrées and the appetizer are designed for sharing, so bring your date. The service is slow and the waiters frequently forget to bring small orders such as olives or glasses of wine. Be sure to check your bill for proper price of wine as mine overestimated.  I would recommend keeping this place in mind for a healthy and fun family or friends diner. A stylish way to start night out.",1,0,1,gene s.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,8,1
4.0,11/18/2008,"Great spot for lunch. Went with a friend who highly recommended it and I wasn't disappointed at all. It's light if you want it to be and can be more than that if that's what you're in the mood for (aren't trying to lose a few like me!). The crowd was mostly office workers on lunch and the place is easy to look at. The manager and wait staff were super cool and it wasn't expensive for the area or quality at all. WHAT ELSE do you want?! Go. I will say, I did drop some dressing on a white shirt which is the reason I won't be getting up today anymore. That's besides the point though.",0,0,1,Danish I.,"New York, NY",18,56,8
3.0,10/15/2008,"Imagine that Panera Bread served wine and wine-related items (olive oils, cheeses, figs, bread with spread, etc.)  That's Fig & Olive.  It's bright inside, the tables are close together, and the menu is a mixture of the same 6 or 8 ingredients used over and over again in different combinations.  The wine list is so-so, and surprisingly limited.  The food is quality, although a little pricey for a chain.  My friend and I ordered the plate of 3 crostinis with the goat cheese & roasted peppers, radish & guacamole, and pine nut & parmesan spreads.  They were tastey, although the portion was suprisingly small.  We shared the salad with cerrano ham, manchego cheese, figs, and greens over crostini spread with goat cheese.  Again, very good.On to dessert!  First up-the mini chocolate cake, which was little more than a semi-dry chocolate cupcake with no frosting.  (It even came in a cupcake wrapper.)  The apple tart with ice cream was nice, with a flaky crust and fresh, thinly sliced apples.Good in a pinch, but if you can find a non-chain wine bar, go with it.",0,0,1,Meredith F.,"Jamaica, NY",99,372,4
5.0,9/29/2008,"Being in NYC for a wedding, we only had one night to go out to dinner on our own. So I asked a friend who used to live here, if he had to go out for one meal, where he would go ...and I am so thankful he said this place, because it was amazing. The atmosphere was so calm and relaxing, yet still made us feel like trendy New Yorkers. To start, we got the beef carpaccio and scallop appetizers. Both just melted in our mouths. And we got to try the different olive oils, all of which were unique in their own way. Ironically, I am not a fan of olives themselves, or figs for that matter -- my bf got the olive sampler and made me try one. Sorry olive, i still don't like you. Anyway, i ordered a special rotisserie chicken meal, and he got a steak. The steak was cooked perfectly, and the chicken was incredibly moist, sometimes a hard feat for a rotisserie chicken. Dessert was an apple tart. Everything was so amazing, and even better was just being a few blocks from the theatre district where we were seeing a show (yes, we were total tourists). For my first time in NYC, it was a wonderful experience!",1,0,1,Kristin C.,"Chicago, IL",34,99,7
2.0,9/27/2008,"To sum this place up, my review is ""eh"". I was so excited to try this place-a place where you can taste different olive oils? Sign me up! However, it was a huge disappointment. The food was just average; I'm sure there are far better charcuterie bars in NYC. The restaurant was extremely noisy; we had to strain to hear the waitress. Which leads me to the biggest complaint-the service. Right before dessert, we finally got the water we asked for twice (not a refill, mind you, our first glass). We had to wait about 15 minutes after being served for someone to explain which meats and cheese were what since our waitress didn't know. Then, when we got our bill, it was wrong. We had to wait at least 30 minutes to pay our bill, during which time our bill was wrong twice.  Just a big disappointment all around.",0,0,1,sarah s.,"Alexandria, VA",5,285,0
4.0,8/21/2008,"Working in midtown, you quickly run out of restaurants at which to dine, so I was thrilled to try Fig & Olive's 52nd Street location.  The restaurant itself is very modern and comfortable with, obviously, a Mediterranean flair.  The bar area downstairs is gorgeous with about thirty low-hanging silver light fixtures above the bar shelf.  And while there are a few tables on the main level, try to be seated upstairs.  There you will sit beneath 10 foot ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows lining one entire wall, letting in lots of light and fresh air.The service is very good, and the waiters/waitresses really know the menu; they are able to offer great suggestions and will help you make the best decisions for food and drink.  Everything we ate (and we ate quite a lot) was delicious!  We tried nearly every appetizer, my favorites being the Seared Sea Scallops with Shaved Artichoke and the Chicken Empanadas.  The server recommended a very nice pasta dish for my entree, the Penne Mediterraneo, which was perfect for a summer's day and served in a bowl instead of a plate, which I loved!  While I didn't have any figs at Fig & Olive, I did very much enjoy all the fresh olive oil drizzled over all the dishes we tried!  I will definitely be back for another meal!",2,1,1,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35
5.0,8/7/2008,"I've never been to any other Fig & Olive, but I definitely was not disappointed with this one.  The service was great.  We made reservations, and we were going to be seated downstairs by the bar area, but it was just too bar-like and noisy with all the people after work.  So, we asked to be seated upstairs, and they were kind enough to grant us that favor.The waitress we had was very attentive.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu items, which was particularly helpful because I've never eaten this type of food before.  I highly recommend the crostini's, especially the shrimp and avocado, and bell pepper one.  It was so delicious.  The chicken samosas (I think that's what they were called) were greasy, but not too bad.  I wouldn't get them again though.  I had the lamb kebabs with couscous, which I thought was not bad either, although it wasn't all that impressive.  My boyfriend got some sort of pasta that was spicey.  He liked it, although I thought it was a bit plain.I must mention the white sangria.  It's a beautiful drink, and I could barely taste the alcohol, which is very important because I'm such a wuss.  The fruits soaked in alcohol in the bottom were also quite tasty.I'd come here again - if I could afford it more often :)",4,1,4,Fen P.,"New York, NY",61,64,39
3.0,8/7/2008,"I'd been meaning to try Fig & Olive after a friend of mine who used to frequent the Upper East Side original location raved about it.  The food was generally good, and not all that expensive considering the location.  We had the fig jamon goat cheese carpaccio, which was so good I considered ordering it twice.  The provencal vegetable salad was also good, if a bit overdressed.  We also tried a cucumber (and apple?) soup, which was refreshing, but which we did not finish.  What killed our lunch bill was the (horrible) sangria.  I don't think I've ever had sangria quite so alcoholic.  We were barely able to choke down one glass, they had so much Grand Marnier in there.  This is even though my  friend was breaking up with her boyfriend-- and if there's any time you need strong alcohol, it's then!The atmosphere is lovely and peaceful.",2,0,2,Alison M.,"Paramus, NJ",165,125,1
1.0,7/31/2008,"went for RW and was underwhelmed. completely underwhelmed. seems like an *okay *joint with *okay* food. i had the melon prosciutto appetizer, the chicken polenta goat cheese entree, and the berries, balsamic, and cream dessert. my appetizer made me wish i had ordered the tuna carpaccio.... the italian folks at my table tried my polenta and agreed that it was gritty and they've certainly had better.... at home.one of my dining companions had the striped bass pipillote on the waiters recommendation and noted how bland it was..... and asked for limes... to which she used all of them...overall, we found the food to be absent from discussion. we hardly had reason to comment on it, as if we were all trying to politely say, this place sucks. my favorite part of the meal was the berries and balsamic... which - um - i could easily make at home. note - avoid the main dining room restrooms. if you visit post-meal.... you may second guess your decision to dine there in the first place. if i had paid any more than the $35 RW special, i would have felt completely ripped off.",3,1,2,Nik N.,"Oakland, CA",115,343,82
