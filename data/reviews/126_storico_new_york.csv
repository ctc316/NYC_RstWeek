4.0,3/17/2019,"Very nice restaurant in the New York Historical Society building.  Having had coffee there several times, friends, my wife and I decided to have dinner there.  Ambiance is very nice, clean and open.  Noise level is moderate - very easy to carry on a conversation.  Service is attentive and friendly but not overbearing.  Food is quite good: pasta, salads, steak, dessert.  Only minor complaint: the butterscotch dessert did not have too much of a butterscotch taste.  Otherwise, a good place to go after visiting the Historical Society, Museum of Natural History, Central Park or anywhere else!",0,0,1,David E.,"Evanston, IL",1,38,0
1.0,2/9/2019,"We had a 1pm reservation for 2 people. A table for six without a reservation were seated immediately before us at three tables of two. There were plenty of empty tables (4 tops), but we were told to wait for the next table of 2. Then, we had no waiter. We waited until 1:25 to get any water, but still no waiter.

3.0,2/9/2019,"Went for a lunch during restaurant week.Due to a miscommunication with the server somehow arancini turned into salad - but I'm not going to complain because that salad was good, and face it...I probably could stand to eat a couple more salads instead of fried rice balls. Alas, I'm sure the arancini would have been amazing. The caesar kale salad was delicious though.Got the Storico Burger - which I ordered with salad - so yes, two salads over the span of a meal (gee Mr. Waiter, this should have been a hint to you, no?) although this was more lightly dressed greens than a proper salad like the caesar. The burger was awesome.The food and atmosphere was great, the slip ups and slow service were annoying.",1,1,1,Heather C.,"New York, NY",164,878,527
2.0,1/24/2019,"Service was awful and slow not just for us but other random tables. We had reservations for lunch and were seated promptly. The server (Fred ?) Was awful. We were right by the bar in high traffic area and waitstaff could see we were waiting 40 minutes for our meal. Ridiculous. The table 2 down had to get theirs to go or must their appointment. YET other tables came after us, were served and left before we got our food. Could it be that our table and that other table had older ""less hip"" patrons? They were offered compensation. We were not. $53 for a disaster lunch is ridiculous. I should deny the charge.... but won't be be warned so you do not have same unpleasantness.",0,0,0,Nancy C.,"Cary, NC",0,5,1
5.0,1/21/2019,"Storico's understated but nuanced take on Italian fare is a ways like the Historical society itself, far more complex and well done than most recognize.  The risotto for example is a rich tapestry of flavors with one bite tasting of rich basil, another of chestnuts, another of leeks. The duck is perfectly cooked with a savory richness that is offset by a delicious sweet creamy puree that accompanies it, two rich flavors that work on different ends of the spectrum to balance one another out. The restaurant is a sunlit delight during the day and a perfect dark golden hue in the evening, great for brunch, dinner or lunch. The decor is perfect, just enough there to create an impression but not to overwhelm either the food or the museum itself. If I had one complaint it's that the menu does not pay homage to the museum itself. Imagine a restaurant that featured an array of historical New York food from the early days, that would truly make it the perfect spot after a museum visit, and certainly could be done well by the staff given how well the current menu is done. As it is now it is still a wonderful post museum, or in the park and want to grab a quick bite eatery. Prices are a bit higher, but inline with museum restaurants, and portions are reasonable. Staff always seems nice, not always the case at museum restaurants. Highly recommend the Parliment cafe next door as well if you are not in the mood for a sit down meal, I believe its run by the same folks, though there is no corresponding menu that would suggest this.",0,0,0,Jonathan B.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,54,5

The food eas great but the service was aweful. We work in the industry and we understand that the place was sliw, but we were out of the place before ten. Our waiter was so rude with us the entire time and we ended up finding two mouses running around the dining room, no noticed the manager and just justified if was an old building.

I typically like to get something other than chicken when I go out to eat (because I have it at home all the time) but the chicken here was amazing!

4.0,10/17/2018,"Place: This place is very stunning! I love the chic white marble look interior with large glass windows and chandeliers. It's a good place to dine with a significant other or to catch up with some friends.Service: The woman at the front slid us a table despite not having reservation which I greatly appreciate since we came very last minute. The waiter also was also very accommodating; he refilled our waters and asked us from time to time if we were alright with everything. The staff here were very hospitable.Food: I ordered the spaghetti while my friend ordered the chicken & kale salad. My friend was very happy with his choice, and I was likewise. Looking at their menu, I was curious to try their version of spaghetti. I don't know about you, but when I think of spaghetti, I think of noodles, tomato sauce, and meat balls. You know, the usual. But here, they brought to me something much tastier. I was surprised with noodles doused in olive oil and mixed in soft yet firm pieces of seafood. I was eager to eat each and every bite. I just wished that I had some bread to sponge up the remaining sauce on the plate. It would have further enhanced the finishing taste.Price: Despite, loving the dish, I was sad to not ordering another plate because of the price. I tend to eat a lot so the amount they gave me served sort of an appetizer to me hahaha. But then again, American serving size is very different from the general world's view of serving sizes.Result: Would I come back? Yes, despite the food being slightly pricey, the taste and the service tempts me to come by and dine there again. I look forward to seeing Storico again soon.",0,0,0,Elaine E.,"Bronx, NY",164,97,626

2.0,7/21/2018,"BRUNCH review only. We'd always wanted to come here after hearing a celebrated chef opened it. A nice (if noisy) room...4/5th empty yet took so long to get service - even water - I was dying of thirst and had to get out my own water bottle. We pointed to an empty corner table, which the greeter said had been ""requested"" - YET IT STAYED COMPLETELY EMPTY FOR THE ENTIRE 2 HOURS WE SAT THERE. After ordering, server returned to say they'd ran out of certain key ingredients - right in peak brunchtime 1.30pm!My unremarkable omelette resembled that which you make yourself at home - a scant portion (looked like exactly 2 eggs) with veggies inside for a very steep $18.But a big shock was the ""tiramisu"" - our party's favorite dessert - I kid you not, it was couple of sponge fingers placed in a shallow bowl then topped with coffee flavored cream - FOR WHICH THEY CHARGED $12. You can tell it was slammed together like that - it wasn't composed as the ""cake"" was chewy and dry. This is a total rip-off  and I can only assume they don't have a proper pastry chef or think the customer is really stupid - it took FOREVER to be served dessert in a now 1/2 full restaurant. And beverages? No chai latte on the menu, unremarkable bottled juices etc. Granted, this is no Untitled @Whitney or Robert @MAD but it shouldn't be this mediocre all round. PS the one good thing were the greens - they had been properly dried and flavorfully seasoned. Gold star to THAT prep chef.",1,0,0,Lynette C.,"New York, NY",22,102,62
4.0,7/6/2018,"Be reassured - this is one of the best places to eat that the Upper West Side has to offer. Storico is by no means a traditional Italian place (nor is it Venetian as it was originally made out to be). So, perhaps it may not please everyone, especially those with different expectations of what an Italian restaurant or a good cafe should be.  However, it is a most pleasant encounter to discover simple but creative dishes that Caffe Storico consistently offers with their highly interesting and varied menu.   Almost every dish I had here was simply very good, in tasting, quality and presentation. A slew of starter types to choose from - stand outs such as marinated sardines, avocado toast, tuna carpaccio, and even nice sandwiches at lunch (i.e. lobster club) or wonderful dinner-time main courses such as Suckling pig or seared scallops - all were terrific. Main dish pastas, in particular the lunch-time bucatini with guanciale--albeit not made in Italy) are perfect sizes, not obscenely large and done to near perfection. Sensible portions, excellent food preparation, a nice variety to choose from, priced reasonably (for Manhattan) plus good service.

4.0,1/25/2018,I visit the NYHS often and really enjoy the museum. I've recently been to the new Parliament cafe and I liked the improvements there. I've never really had a chance to try Storico because it seems like a sit down place but I glad I finally tried it. My friend and I ordered a soup that was offered at the time. It was lentils and escarole with pancetta. It was perfectly balanced and delicious. Very rich but not overwhelming. It made me curious about other items on the menu.

4.0,11/22/2017,"Finally made it over to Storico for drinks with a colleague and what a wonderful addition to CPW, and N-YHS in particular. It's a big, bright, airy space in the side entryway of the museum (off of 79th Street) with a small bar, open kitchen, and generous seating. They have a small selection of wines by the glass (about 3 of each kind, red, white, sparkling, and one rose) and about five beers to choose from. They have a small curated selection of cocktails that touch all the major liquors (brown, clear, tequila etc.) and a bit larger selection of wines by the bottle. The food menu is lovely for dinner - we ordered the burratta which is served cold and mounding on top of a nice chewy sourdough bread and with some microgreens. The staff is attentive and pleasant.

4.0,10/22/2017,"This is a cute restaurant inside the New York Historical Society (across from the Museum of Natural History) that I think would be perfect for a museum day brunch. The recently renovated space is so cute with the chartreuse couches, marble tables, chandeliers, and china display. There's also a window through which you can see the ""Dying Chief"" sculpture in the museum lobby.I actually came here for a dinner event -- not so sure I would've found or come to this place on my own. The food was very good. We started off at the bar, where I ordered the Central Park drink (vodka/cucumber/mint). Then we moved to tables and started off with a cheese and cured meat board. My favorite was the preserved walnuts and one of the cheeses drizzled with honey. For the appetizer, I had the wild mushroom topped with a crispy soft-boiled egg, which was good but not flavorful enough for my taste. For my entree, I had the skirt steak with figs, romaine, and farrotto. It was delicious (!!) and I'm not even a steak person. For dessert, I really liked the deconstructed tiramisu. I also just had to take a picture of the Big Apple, which I didn't try, but look how adorable it is!Will have to plan a museum day and return for brunch!",0,0,0,Megan G.,"Manhattan, NY",98,74,57
4.0,10/18/2017,"I hadn't heard of Storico until the day I showed up for dinner. The space is incredibly well designed and refreshingly open. High ceiling with gold chandeliers contrasting with the white walls and china was just so open and fun. The bar area was small but quaint. I started with the Cabernet Sauvignon Blend and for a person who does not like red wine very much, this was absolutely delightful, it was light and slightly sweet. I had three glasses, that's how good it was. I would definitely recommend getting the sharing boards because the cheeses were phenomenal, but the stars of the board are the preserved walnuts and the charred country bread. I had never had Burrata before, so I tried it for the appetizer, it was so light and fresh I happily finished the whole thing. The tried the mushroom salad as well and it was really good, but much heavier since it's a whole egg slightly fried along with the mushrooms.  I tried all the entree options but you MUST try the Pumpkin Risotto. It's like the grown-up mac and cheese of your dreams, the aged parmesan was to die for.  The scallop dish was also good. Aside from that the other entree I would recommend is Skirt Steak, the farrotto was delicious and balanced well with the flavorful meat (which comes pretty rare, so fair warning on that). I had ordered the Linguine alle Vongole initially but it was too salty for my taste and when I commented on it the waiter happily replaced my entree which was definitely more than i expected. I have to say their service team was exceptional and professional. I finished my meal with a deconstructed Tiramisu which was the perfect ending to the meal. The ice cream was really creamy and not too sweet and the coffee foam was light and full of coffee flavor. I have to say though that the Big Apple was very well presented. Overall I would definitely come back for dinner or just to catch up with friends. It's a great location and very friendly atmosphere.",0,0,0,Holly M.,"New York, NY",43,108,181
5.0,10/18/2017,"I hadn't heard of Storico prior to coming here with a group, but since dining at the restaurant I've already recommended it to a few people I know! The restaurant is located inside the New York Historical Society, but you can access it without being a member. The menu was recently changed and the inside of Storico was updated with some renovations. The result was a very clean, bright and open feeling restaurant with so great offerings on their menu. Served by an incredibly friendly and welcoming staff I ordered the steak tartare, seared diver sea scallops, and the Big Apple dessert after starting off with the meat and cheese sharing boards. All the food was served in a beautiful fashion - and it was as fun to eat as it was to look at. I was blown away in particular by the scallops and the accompanying pork belly. The pork was so juicy and flavorful, while the scallops were perfectly prepared and were neither over or undercooked. If you want a super instagrammable desert, then the Big Apple is definitely for you. It's a dessert full of apples served in a concoction that's shaped like a little apple. It's absolutely adorable!

Think would be better if the chocolate sphere was sealed (melt the ends and let it hardened) it would be better when customers crack. Scallops and pork belly was excellent, melts in mouth, succulent, flavorful. Tuna carpaccio was good but wish uni was spread on the tuna.

5.0,10/16/2017,"The most incredible restaurant in the NY Historical Society. The decor is simple with large windows, cases of china plates (that looks like they can from the historical society's displays), an open kitchen, gold chandeliers, and pops of bright yellow with their couches. I went with a large group and tried almost everything. We began with the meat and cheese platter which had a perfect mix of hard, soft, stinky, salty and crunchy. Then we had the tuna carpaccio which was my favorite dish served with sea salt to give the tuna a crunch, and uni toast on the side. We also had the buratta which had a refreshing pesto, wild mushrooms with a really umami fried soft boiled egg, and the beef tartare served bone marrow with a quail egg which was the most beautiful dish I've seen. For entrees we got the pumpkin risotto which was rich, but cut well by an aged Parmesan and a 50 year old balsamic. We also got the pork belly and scallop dish - both proteins were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside - it was also artfully done with quail eggs (second use of quail eggs) on the scallops. Lastly, we finished off with the big apple which I found to be a big disappointing. I skimmed the menu for this choice and had expected a baked apple so was a bit disappointed when creme apple stuffed with apples showed up instead of the real deal. However, it was a beautiful bright red so made for great pictures. Overall, storico is fun for a meal before/after the NY historical society, the museum of natural history (which is only one block away) or a nice stroll in Central Park.

After pointing out the issue again, they asked if we wanted the rest of the fruit from the same plate!  Their big concession was to take the cost of the fruit plate off the bill. We are not unreasonable people and don't expect perfect fruit.  What we do expect is to not be served ROTTING fruit. Even then, we understand that mistakes can occur. However, the dismissive way in which the situation was handled was just as appalling as the rotting fruit itself. After the initial apology, they just didn't seem to care that much about what should have been an absolutely mortifying situation.

Upon arriving for our reservation we were told that a ""special event"" was taking place and we would have to wait until the staff had their pre-show and meeting. The funny part is that they had called us several hours prior to confirm the reservation and never mentioned we would not be seated on time or that we would have to wait 30 minutes outside the restaurant on a super hot day to be seated. The air conditioned coffee shop next door closed at 5pm. After coming back late for our reservation after being kicked out we were informed that complimentary apps had been pre- prepared for us. The apps showed up (one cold appetizer to be exact) and the server took our order. Before dinner complimentary champagne was served and a glass was subsequently dumped in my lap and splashed in my face. The server apologized however no management ever came over to address the situation. They FOH staff seemed to laugh it off and we were served dinner. Food was outstanding, fresh pasta and seafood all executed well. I WOULD go back for the food. At the end of the dinner we were dropped the check and ignored no compensation was made for ruining my clothes or inconveniencing me with a cold champagne shower(not the right venue for that).

5.0,5/31/2017,"What a fantastic little Italian spot right next to Central Park. Not only was the food and service top notch, but the aesthetics were very pleasing as well. Both the lunch and the dinner menus had a good selection between appetizers, pastas, salads, etc. You have the option between half and full size entrees which can lead to a multitude of combinations when sharing dishes between the table. I might also add that if you're a coffee lover you need to get a cappuccino or espresso as it was some of the best I have had to date. Our only complaint was the price. We felt it was just slightly over priced, but I would like to note that the locals told me it is actually very reasonable for New York City. All in all make sure you stop by.

2.0,12/29/2016,Enjoyed the museum and looked forward to this highly rated cafe. Yes the ambience is lovely but the hostess wasn't available to greet the line of people waiting for a seat so some left to the espresso bar. We waited. Finally without a smile or warmth we finally were seated but the waiter was friendly. The tables around us and ours waited quite a while. Seems that dishes came out one at a time. Not good for the table next to us waiting with 2 children for a long time.  Two of us ordered the pear risotto and what a disappointment. A plate of wet mushy rice with very little pieces of pear. No taste and texture bland. A package of Trader Joe risotto has more taste and better consistency. One serving of the pasta with speck cheese etc. nice flavors but not combined to make one dish. Each ingredient was a separate taste on the plate. On top of this the prices of these uninspired dishes are not appropriate. Stick with appetizer size because definitely not worth the full size price. A rip off.,0,0,0,Elaine B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,79,0

The atmosphere was charming (very white and clean) and the service excellent. My wife and I ordered the Portabello Panini and the Chopped Salad, and then shared.  The salad was very good but not exactly what you would expect of a chopped salad.  It was more like a traditional salad with baby greens, apple, feta, a healthy helping of avocado and candied pancetta.  The portabello panini was outstanding.  I am not sure what they marinate their portabello in, but it was extremely flavorful.  The sandwich was cooked just right.  The sandwich came with a plain side salad.  Our friend ordered the Arugula Salad and the Ricotta/Chick Pea Crostini.  I tried some of the crostini and was unimpressed - the toast was a bit too burnt.  Overall, it was an excellent choice and will return in the future.",0,0,0,Darryl R.,"New York, NY",0,478,77

5.0,7/28/2015,"Wow. I came here to photograph a wedding reception and had a really great time in a truly amazing venue. You can probably tell by the photos, but the ambience of this intimate restaurant is so cheery and lovely. Normally, I'm not a fan of yellow from an aesthetic viewpoint, but the lemony hue just WORKS for this restaurant. It's so lovely to see the light coming in from the sun and ricocheting off the delicate china and yellow furniture. The managers, staff, and cooking team are superbly accommodating and helpful as well.I sat near the second bar area, right by the open kitchen, so it was like a live showing of Food Network or something. It was so cool to see the food getting prepared, and the manager, chef, sous chef, and line cooks were so friendly and willing to explain the dishes to me. The maitre d's were also polite and friendly. The entire atmosphere was just really conducive to a positive dining experience.The first antipasti dish I tried was the Misticanza Salad, which consists of arugula, cherry tomatoes, and ricotta salad. The flavoring of this salad was quite lovely and balanced. I never felt like the salad was too stingy with dressing, or completely drowned in the stuff. The arugula was extremely fresh and was complemented nicely by the cherry tomatoes and cheese. Light, refreshing, and clean antipasti dish.The second antipasti dish I had was the Burrata, which also came with English peas, spring garlic, and radish. First, the presentation of this dish was fantastic. It was so beautifully laid out on a nice, creamy pea base. The colors just screamed Spring/Summer. I was tentative about it before I tried it, thinking that it might be a bit too heavy for me as an antipasti, but the manager reassured me that it was light, and he couldn't have been more correct. While the burrata is perfectly creamy and smooth, it is not heavy or dense by any means. The taste isn't in-your-face either; I'd actually consider this one a palate-cleanser. The light and subtle flavors of the cheese and peas went together very well and made for an excellent antipasti.For the primi dish, I had the Mushroom Cappelletti en Brodo with pecorino and leeks. The cappelletti was perfectly al dente - a tricky feat. It came in this lovely broth that was nutty, rich, and not too salty. The mushroom wasn't overwhelming, and was complemented very well by the hints of leek. It was a great dish and the portion size was very nice for a primi dish. I learned that the chef personally went to the artisan pasta maker and sat down for an entire day to make sure that the pasta was crafted perfectly, which I find very admirable.For the secondi, I went for the 28 Day Dry Aged NY Strip Steak. Wow. It was served with salsa verde and this amazing crispy polenta that I am still marveling over. The polenta had this great crunch on the outside and was so warm, creamy, and smooth on the inside. The salsa verde went very well with the steak and elevated the flavors of the beef. My favorite kind of steak is one that is crispier and rougher on the edges and pretty medium-rare on the inside, and the chefs here executed it perfectly. I was very satisfied with this dish (and I'm very picky about my steaks).Contorni included grilled asparagus with lemon aioli and zucchini fried in an herb tempura and olive oil. The asparagus was grilled to perfection and who would have known that lemon aioli would make it taste so GOOD? And the fried zucchini...wow. It reminded me of sweet potato fries. Not soggy or greasy (it probably was greasy, but it didn't TASTE greasy). So crispy and fun and I could have eaten like five plates of it, but I had to save room. As I've stated before, this is a great restaurant with fantastic staff and ambience. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for an nice, intimate, and upscale Italian dining experience. Also, it's location in the Upper West Side is very nice. Would come back again.",6,0,4,Katherine Z.,"Washington, DC",561,473,556

Very bright and light space with cheerful light green banquet benches and everything else very bright white. Beautifully decorated and lovely atmosphere. We had the burrata starter, covered with fresh peas and pea shoots, and the duck papardelle, and a couple of salads. Everything was delicious. The only thing I would change would be to make the chocolate and orange flavors pop a little more on the duck. Maybe use a little more bitter chocolate and more orange zest. But it was still yummy (though a little hefty). Lighter appetites will do well with the salads. We had a child with us and it was no problem; the staff was very attentive and nice.

Thanks for the explanation!It's a limited menu; I had the grilled chicken panini, with ""broccolini, onion mostarda & fontina"". What arrived was a tiny sandwich, with little evidence of grilling, no discernible broccolini, and cold insides (the cheese was melted at the edges but not in the center). The onion mostarda had a pasty, mushy texture - not appealing. The sandwich was accompanied by a warm potato salad - a few chunks bathed in vinaigrette. For dessert I had the tiramisu: a small portion served in a coffee cup -- good but nothing special.Service was lackadaisical and charmless.It's a lovely space and impressive room, with high ceilings, great light, and all that gorgeous white porcelain in the built-ins up the walls... but the food and service were sub-par and seemingly not in line with either the location or the prices (sandwich + glass of lambrusco + split dessert approached $40 w/tax+tip).",3,1,1,J.

I inhaled the lemon and cherry bombolinis to start; I preferred the lemon custardy texture over the cherry jam, since the former was tangier, zestier, just overall more arousing. A small downside was the INTENSE coating of sugar, completely smothering the surface. Not a big deal, since they only pumped up my taste buds for some savory goodness. All 3 following dishes were spot on: the polenta and eggs, with tallegio and mushroom ragu; pappardelle w duck ragu; and the standout - a simple spaghetti carbonara w pancetta, gooey grated cheese, and a sunnyside egg sitting on top. The first two were great. The polenta had the perfect consistency, not runny, but not thick. It was hearty and filling, though paled a bit in flavor RELATIVE to the pasta dishes. I remember the pappardelle having a nice kick to it; I was a fan. But the spaghetti was out-of-this-world. The sharp and meaty taste of the pancetta cut into the rest of the dish, both in flavor and texture, while the yolk from the runny egg oozed out and coated the noodles in a smooth and even layer. Absolute amazeballs. I admit that the kitchen was occasionally noisy - dishes dropping, pans clattering, cooks chattering, but the pasta was a distraction. A scrumptious, delectable, mouthwatering distraction.",1,2,1,Rebecca H.,"New York, NY",22,56,659
1.0,1/31/2015,Hostess ( a kid who knew nothing) seated us in a table next to the kitchen/bar-the worst deuce in the house with most tables available at 6:30 pm. Waited 10 minutes for a glass of water. Noisy with minimal people in rest. Bad vibe. Hire a real hostess to greet people.

5.0,1/31/2015,"Caffe Storico is to the NY Historical Society what Café Sabarsky is to Neue Galerie - GORGEOUS!Central Park's truly caught in the middle here! Bookended east to west with two fantastic restaurants: Sabarsky to the east and Storico to the west. Where Cafe Sabarsky's dark, classic and elegant, Storico is bright, modern and refreshing. Just sitting here and having a cup of coffee already elevates the day.Was here for lunch during the week without a reservation and was immediately sat. The food is delicious and the salad servings most abundant. Now Storico is not a place for a quick meal with quick acting service but rather a leisurely stay with appropriately calm and attentive service. Items are reasonably priced for a museum restaurant (appetizers and mains $8-$22) and they operate a full service cocktail and coffee bar.Second, the space is gorgeous and very well done. Aesthetes, interior designers or designers in general, will surely love it.

3.0,1/13/2015,"I'll be honest, I had pretty low expectations as it's literally inside the same building as the New York Historical Society and assumed they'd count on people eating there out of convenience (and it's very convenient when you're going to the NY Historical Society or American Museum of Natural History). I went for brunch on Saturday at noon with a girlfriend; I had made a reservation on OpenTable, but there were also some available seats so it's probably not necessary. The cafe is really cute, very bright and airy. We were seated promptly and ordered quickly. I had the baked eggs and spicy tomato and my friend had the spinach frittata. Both came with two pieces of toast. The food was very tasty, my eggs were cooked perfectly and it was a little spicy but not mouth-burning, but it was a pretty small serving. Thankfully I wasn't very hungry so it worked out, but if you are hungry I'd recommend ordering a side. On the other hand, the frittata was pretty big and my friend said it was good. Our waitress was very nice, but the service really left something to be desired - no one checked on us, and we had ask at the bar twice for salt and pepper.",0,0,0,Laura C.,"Manhattan, NY",7,22,0

My boyfriend and I arrived and were seated at a table meant for 4 people, not a big deal as the restaurant just opened and we were the second table seated. However, the host immediately sat two people (an older man and his son) right next to us! Under normal circumstances, this isn't an issue as I know space is a premium in crowded restaurants however there were a total of 6 people in the restaurant at the time. We spent the duration of our meal trying not to elbow our forced table mates and awkwardly not making eye contact as we ate in the empty restaurant.

The desserts were meh but the rest was great.The bad: This restaurant could be much better if the management wasn't made up of two young men who stand around and do nothing while the waitstaff run their butts off and customers wait. We waited for 20 mins for our check, our ""neighbors"" waited to place drink orders and a man at the bar waited to order his food all while the two young men stood by, leaning on the bar and chatting with one another. The bartender actually came out from behind the bar to care for a customer at a table, while those two stood by and did nothing. We tried to make eye contact with them (we were across from the bar) but neither ever checked in with the room and looked to see how their customers' experiences were going. The ugly: The hostess dropped a menu on the floor and then placed it on the customer's napkin and walked off. That is disgusting and unacceptable in a Denny's.

2.0,8/25/2014,"Was there with a group of 5 friends (40's and 50's age wise), having a guys night - talk some business, catch up, and ready to spend amply for a great dinner.Food was 3.5 star - solid flavors, well executed, but small portions even for high end dining - with the exception of the osso buco. Burrata dish had a thimble size dollop of cheese...and the pasta portions (about $20 per) were absurdly small.Decor was 3.5 star. Pretty room with windows onto the trees of CPW - ground floor restaurant so just the wall of trees, but quite nice. The room is way too bright though and not comfortable feeling - way to white and sterile (almost like a hospital in fact).Service was 1.0 star unfortunately. The waitress was a very awkward young lady in general, who just didn't ""get it"" regarding the level of service she should be providing. Or due to the Natural History Museum local she used to serving many tourists who tolerate poor attitudes better, as they are just excited to be in NYC.This was a Tuesday night, and despite the host the week before pretending on the phone to be closely searching his book for an open table when I made the reservation, the restaurant was completely empty when we arrived at 8:00 (one other table perhaps) - and stayed that way until closing. Despite expecting good service, we are a nice group of guys, laid back and not really complainers. But despite the empty restaurant, our cocktails took a half hour to come to our table!!! When we inquired about the delay, the waitress said they had to go downstairs fo the stock room for more liquor. She actually said to us ""the wait is better than having no liquor in your drinks, isn't it?"". How about, properly stock your bar for dinner service, or use a higher end spirit to get the drinks to the table quicker, or at least the tall clueless manager (doing nothing in the corner), could have come by and apologized for the delay (that would have made all the difference)...but of course, despite being fully aware of the delay, he did nothing.Then, when we simply suggessted to mention to the kitchen how small the previously mentioned burrata appetizers were, she said ""well it's really meant to be eaten by one person"". Attitude yet again, and the funny thing is she reccomended these as good ""share dishes"" when we asked her opinion!Than just the additional usual nonsense with poor service. The place was empty so 10 feet from us in clear view she was talking to the bartender and other staff about us regarding our minor and understandable complaints...with all of them staring at us confrontationally- especially the short bald bartender guy who was giving us dirty looks, probably because he heard we critiqued the 30-minute cocktail wait. Hey buddy, stop hitting on waitresses and keep your bar properly stocked! Our waitress also cleared several drinks before they were empty without asking us, and spent the night chit-chatting with the bartender and cluless manager, to the point where we had to wave her over to get her attention - literally flailing away with both arms until she noticed. Needless to say we spent $600+, but instead of drinking more there and ordering some additional high end bottles of wine (which was the original plan)...we took our business to an unplanned second venue for some great wine and extended the evening. They can thank Caffe Storico's poor service for our business!!Pretty room, and promising food...but the Stephen Starr affilliation, like so many underperforming venues connected to famous restaurant groups, does not make up for the ""Applebees"" level staff and service.

4.0,7/29/2014,"RW Summer 2014 review:I'm not a big fan of Italian food and Italian restaurants in general but I had a surprisingly wonderful experience at Caffe Storico. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I'm just not that generous with my stars and again, I'm not a big fan of Italian food. However this place did deliver and I would definitely understand people giving this restaurant 5 stars. It's very cute, elegant, as fancy looking as it looks in photos but is casual enough and unpretentious to give off a relaxed vibe.  The place isn't huge, has an open kitchen, and shares the building with a museum. The service was impeccable. I actually regret not giving them more than 20% in tip because the service was truly outstanding and memorable. I highly recommend the panzanella salad for appetizer and bucatini fruitti de mare for the entree. APPETIZERSCrisp Spaetzle - I found it interesting because it was my first time to have such appetizer. It was good but it wasn't amazing. Roasted Baby Beets - pretty boring salad, nothing specialPanzanella Salad - wow just wow I enjoyed this salad a lot and I'm not even the type to get salad at a restaurant. It was very flavorful and the croutons were so good. ENTREESBucatini Fruitti de Mare - OMG this had to be the highlight of our dinner. It was flavorful and delicious. I have to warn you that it's a bit spicy but I love spicy food so I enjoyed this entree a lot. I had to scoop out the remaining sauce and pretty much cleaned my plate at the end because I just couldn't get enough of the flavor. Flat Iron Steak - This was pretty good too. It was smokey and cooked perfectly for us. I've had better chimichurris though so I wasn't too impressed with their sauce. Roasted Organic Chicken - Chicken was good but nothing impressive. I love mushrooms so I was a bit disappointed because the mushrooms came out pretty salty. The gnocchis were good though.DESSERTBoth the tiramisu and apricot panna cotta were creamy and delicious.",5,1,1,Nin A.,"New York, NY",136,367,185

As a New Yorker, I'm fully aware that one must be willing to shell out the extra money to go to a place like this. I decided to go for it, desiring a respite from museum-visiting with family and out-of-town visitors. I suggested some pampering over coffee, and one in our party of four hadn't had lunch and wanted a light meal. Unsurprisingly, another mixed age party with mixed desires arrived at the same time as us. The place was half-empty but clearly open for business, making me a bit unhappy to be treated rather coldly by the greeter. Both parties were quite direct in explaining our unconventional intents, which ought to be accommodated at a place serving as a museum cafe (glorified), especially after peak hours have passed. We were served and given menus and had our orders taken promptly by pleasant servers at our table. But we had to wait an unacceptable 15-20 minutes for our ordinary coffees that, at $3.50, were unremarkable and rather small. No refills were offered. As for lunch, the meal served was exquisitely delicious if pricey and small. The servers were friendly and graceful, and filled our water repeatedly but never explained or apologized for the coffee taking such an unacceptably long time, given huge numbers of staff still on duty. Also, it's clearly stated on the sign and on-line that the place is open all day long. Management at both the restaurant and the museum needs to address what happens here during off hours.

After we finished eating, I asked the waitress if the pasta was cooked in separate water from the wheat pasta. She asked the chef and returned to say no it had not been. This, I admit, was partially my mistake for not asking the waitress before. I assumed, if they offered gluten free pasta, the chef would know something about cross contamination.  After we paid the bill, I was approached by a manager, who told me, that she was informed of my allergy and apologized for the mistake but didn't quite understand why this was an issue.  She added her friend is a celiac and she eats the pasta and many other customers do and they never asked this question.  The most insulting portion of this is encounter with the manager was that she added......""this is a SHARED RESPONSIBILITY, so next time you know to ask first"".  I can't believe that a food establishment would even state this to a customer.

My aunt & I went for brunch, and while we definitely enjoyed ourselves, I was not left itching to come back. My baked eggs dish was fairly good, not amazing, but my aunt's order got completely messed up - and she'd ordered scrambled eggs with a side salad. When they finally got her the right thing, the portion was meager and the plating lazy; in such an image focused setting I expected them to turn out something a little nicer looking. A little garnish never killed nobody (I think). We had two different servers, one great, one not so much. We waited forever to pay our bill, but at least that meant we got to enjoy the bright sunny room a bit longer. Word to the wise - they take reservations even for brunch, and we heard larger parties getting turned away.",1,1,0,Colleen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",266,330,61
5.0,7/20/2013,"What a surprise this meal was. I went to Caffe Storico on a nearly 100 degree evening  because it just seemed easier after a visit to the Historical Society. I did not think I was going to get anything more than your typical museum meal-meaning overpriced and totally forgettable. Was I wrong. First of all was the cocktail. Sitting at the bar, being served by a wonderful and knowledgeable bartender, we had two of the best made Manhattans. Generously sized and mixed to perfection. We then tried the buratta and the bitter greens as starters. Both were made with a deft hand on the dressing and were really fresh. Finally, we had the lamb pasta and the veal tartar. The pasta was delicious and while the size is not a typical NY over sized platter of food, it was just enough and very, very good. The tartar was not quite what I expected but still really lovely. Very fresh and not overly dressed. A scoop of gelato rounded out the meal.The room was quiet and spacious. While we sat at the bar, the tables did look a little small in the room. But the entire experience, from the welcome as we came in to the friendly service to the well prepared food, was entirely delightful.

The decor reminded me of the country, white and yellow, glass cabinets displaying dinnerware and an open kitchen. We were sat by the hostess and greeted by some menus. I ordered a bloody mary, burrata and the oxtail agnolotti, my friend orders the toast. Bloody mary was good, had the right amount of kick and vodka. My first time trying a burrata, it basically tastes like mozzerella a little stringing at some parts and creamy at the same time. The agnolotti was amazing, it was seasoned prefectly, and smelled great, my friend and I finished it all.

4.0,6/7/2013,"Pickled ramps cocktail! Probably not available anymore and basically just a gimlet. Man, I could really go for a gimlet right now, to be honest. I'm not walking all the way to the Museum of the City of New York to have one, though. Or is this the New-York Historical Society? I can't ever distinguish between the two. But the New-York Historical Society has a hypen in ""New York"" because that's how it was written in olden times. And it also has the most gorgeous cafe-cum-restaurant at any museum in New York. Except Cafe Sabarsky. And the Modern at MoMA. And I really like the cafe at the Ruben Museum downtown. But if your kids really want to see the squid and the whale, just find some homeless guy to take them inside (remember, the admission fee is only ""suggested"") and then head across the street to Caffe Storico for a few gimlets, with or without pickled ramps. I may even be seated next to you. But probably not, because I don't really go here that often.

2.0,11/25/2012,"This is the first place that made me realize what a museum cafe should NOT be about.  While it is a lovely space, the purpose of a museum cafe should be a respite and a place where food is available to those enjoying the exhibits.  Instead, the menu at Cafe Storico is designed with three courses in mind - salad, main & sorbet/gelato. There were two mothers who were awkwardly trying to bottle feed babies while I was there and they just looked out of place. The menu doesn't really have any child-friendly options.  It's great for a standalone restaurant, but not in a place where you have things to see!    I think it's a great spot for ""ladies who lunch"" and can spend an afternoon without any time pressures.In addition, the space is also not designed appropriately.  The hostess was tucked into a wall cupboard, away from the sightline of people coming into the restaurant from two different sets of doors. Facing the wall, she isn't able to see customers when they first enter from either entrance. As a result, some patrons coming in didn't realize that they were expected to wait to be seated and the hostess had to chase them down, which I think reflects poorly on the establishment.  I also think if a computer is needed for reservations, etc., it should be installed at the bar, and instead there should be a lectern with menus and a hostess positioned to greet patrons (otherwise, what's the point of having someone there?) Finally, menus were not posted outside, which may also help inform patrons of what the cafe has available.In conclusion, I think the restaurant concept of Storico works well as a secondary, more private, dining room in the museum space. However, the primary function is lacking and there should be more flexibility with the range of food options offered, like sandwiches, fruit plates, and a variety of baked goods. It is not a welcome space where families, especially, can take a brief respite from the exhibits.",3,3,1,Asta S.,"Boston, MA",22,363,28
5.0,11/20/2012,"J'adore. When your future Mother-in-Law suggests eating on the Upper West Side, you may not be excited for a few reasons. Let's start with the fact that you and her have completely different tastes and I'm sure whatever she loves is not at all what you love. Also, the Upper West? I don't have anything against it, other than it's far away from my apartment which is a real pain and when she mentioned the restaurant was in the New York Historical Society I just assumed it was dark and old and not in a good downtown speakeasy sort of way. But I went, because that's what good Daughter-in-Laws-to-be do, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Caffe Storico is gorgeous. It's not at all the dumpy old museum restaurant I assumed it would be. It's all airy and high ceilings with original building details painted white and bright yellow accents everywhere to cheer it up even more. Honestly it makes a modern statement with the twist on the traditional building you see outside and assume will be inside as well. The marble tables, hardwood floors and white and wood chairs all work so well together, my heart skipped a beat for a moment as I made my way to...you guessed it! The bar. They have a lovely drinks menu, loaded with wines and a few artfully crafted cocktails, all of which were surprisingly strong, yet still delicious. I personally had many of the Bellini Stagionale, the perfect fall/winter beverage consisting of prosecco, apple cider and figenza. It has hints of spice, a tad bubbly and very heartwarming. You know I heart good cocktails. I was instantly in love, but anxious to get a move on dinner...you know how I adore food. My fiance's mother arrived and we sat at one of the tables near a massive window looking out onto the Natural History Museum, which isn't a half bad view, if you care about my opinion at all. The menu is sort of the perfect size, plenty of options, but not so overwhelming that you just can't get it together and wind up ordering something you realize you didn't really want once it arrives. We tried a couple of the appetizers: Meatballs, Whipped Baccala, Chicken Liver Crostini, Mozzarella in Carrozza. All were very good. I especially liked the chicken liver crostini and have been back several times since my first visit and always order it. The only appetizer that left something to be desired was the marinated olives. I don't even know how you mess that up. Really. But these olives tasted like straight up play-doh, and if you are wondering how I know that, please don't ask. I didn't say I was proud to know that's what it tasted like, but I want to be as accurate as possible for you. You're welcome. In an effort to have full disclosure, all the appetizers are really small. I mean you couldn't share. Or you could, but then you have to get a lot of them. Sorry I am a complete pig. In any event, we loved everything else and continued on to the main courses. Since I have been here a few times I'll just tell you about everything I've tried. I hope you like this lengthy format. If you don't, head over to the next review, but I can almost guarantee you mine is better. Gnocchi Gratinata with black truffle fonduta. This was heavy like gnocchi usually is, but the small portion size left me happy and full, not overstuffed and sick. It was very tasty, and they went heavy on the truffles which is exactly how I like it. Hand Rolled Garganelli with cauliflower, pine nuts and bottarga di muggine. So this was supposed to be a play on a cream sauce. The sauce was white and looked heavy, but...surprise! It wasn't. It was just the pine nuts and cauliflower ground up together and it was a great lighter option, again, the small portion keeps your stomach from hating you, and this sauce was a winner. Pappardelle with Duck Ragu, shaved chocolate and orange. I don't love chocolate, but it was barely noticeable and balanced out the orange nicely. This was the heaviest of the three dishes, as well as the most filling, but again, a much smaller portion that you see most places. The duck was very well cooked and the rich flavors were perfect for a really cold night. I approve. Oh right! Dessert! I rarely order dessert after dinner, I'm usually too full and would rather fill up on savory food anyway, so I tend to skip the after dinner sugar for an after dinner drink. However, I went for a birthday party recently and so I was forced into dessert (I actually do mean forced) and ordered the Chocolate-Cherry Budino with candied pistachios and whipped goat cheese. It was so, so good. I am thinking because it was much more savory that sweet, I liked it even better. The goat cheese was totally weird on it's own, but very good combined with a bite full of everything. Just order it. Great new find I might not have tried if not for the coaxing of a soon-to-be family member. Oh and the prices? Low. Like, weirdly low for the caliber of food and the beautiful space.

Fava beans and walnut crostini were good, but not in the same class as the rest.Hand rolled garganelli with tiny specks of cauliflower, pine nuts and botttarga de muggine was amazing.  It was a tiny plate, but, like Barney Greengrass's nova, eggs, and onions, was almost too rich to finish.  Bottarga (dried mullet roe) is one of those ingredients like truffles or caviar- - eye-wateringly expensive and shaved over a dish in tiny amounts.  The shaving here was very thick.  One more expensive item off my bucket list.The star was Veal Milanese.  A gigantic chop, pounded thin, lightly breaded and sauteed in butter, with spring vegetables shaved paper thin.  The veggies had a sharp dressing which balanced perfectly with the richness of the chop.  This sort of precision is what sets the Storico apart from ordinary or even very good Italian places.Chocolate budino with drunken prunes and whipped crème fraîche was the perfect ending.  Amazingly rich bitter chocolate, yet feather-light and perfectly balanced by the prunes.Rasberry sorbet was delicious, outshone only by the gelato.Service was great.  Ths only thing I'd change would be to add sound treatment.  The racket got overwhelming as the place filled up.Considering the quality, the prices were low -- maybe half what you'd pay in a ** or *** place with equivalent pretentions.",2,0,1,krs m.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,36,0

When I finally found the entrance, I saw one beautiful, elegant, yet casual restaurant. Perfect for a casual date spot in the UWS. The server really knows the food and was really helpful, since I couldn't understand the Italian lingo menu. We ended up having:Appetizer1. Sauteed sea scallop - A very light, savory, and tender taste. 2. Rabbit porchetta - First time having rabbit meat and it was not bad at all, highly recommended. 3. Veal tartare - Another exotic item on the menu, worth giving a try.Pasta4. Ricotta cavatelli - Looked like worms and not very eye catching but it was wonderful with pieces of lobster and mushrooms. 5. Pappardelle with duck ragu, shaved chocolate & orange - It had an interesting taste.6. Oxtail agnolotti with broccolini & fresh horseradish - This was the most delicious pasta, highly recommended. But you really can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes. Dessert7. Chocolate gelato - Holy shit! This is one of the BEST chocolate gelato I've had and it's homemade. It's so rich, bold, and creamy. 8. Pear & lemon sorbet - So good! Also homemade and I liked the pear sorbet better, it tasted better than a pear. 9. Amaretto semifreddo - Part ice cream and cookie, very exquisite. Their desserts are seriously outstanding.",3,1,3,Jin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,732,2395
3.0,3/11/2012,"Pretty decor - pure white and shiny china everywhere...offset with bright yellow bar stools and booth seating.  Not too busy for Sunday brunch.  Prices on the pricier side.  I'd skip the bomboloni - basically a mini donut that tastes just like a Dunkin Donuts donut (albeit with different fillings, i.e. apricot, hazelnut) but for the hefty price of $6.  I could have six full sized donuts for that price!  I had the smoked salmon and goat cheese and herb frittata, which was good.  No skimping on the salmon, which was placed over the frittata.  The only thing was the goat cheese wasn't spread evenly at all, there were just a few large clumps in three spots and none anywhere else.  My friend enjoyed the meatballs and fried risotto balls.  Hostess was friendly and waitress nice; no complaints on service which was fine.",0,0,1,Food E.,"Manhattan, NY",8,587,219

The architecture and decor is beautiful and elegant: lots of natural light, high ceilings, brass chandeliers, china from the museum's collection tastefully displayed on the walls, and a pop of bright color to keep things fun. The food is pricey but good (sometimes great) -- definitely get the meatballs and the tuna salad. The service is friendly but sometimes harried during very busy hours.Not that I needed another reason to come to this fabulous museum, but Caffe Storico is a welcome bonus!",3,0,1,C.J.

4.0,1/29/2012,"I went here today with a friend for brunch after reading about the place in TastingTable's email.  Didn't know what to expect being that it just opened, but I found the food and service to be very pleasant.  We didn't have a probably securing a reservation and when we were there at 12 pm, it was hardly packed. Since we weren't too hungry, we shared the cicchetti (arancini) which were fried rice balls with saffron.  It came out as 4 small balls on a plate with shaved cheese on top.  Simple, bite sized and flavorful without being heavy.  Just wished the rice balls were larger or had more to an order.I ordered the baked eggs with spicy tomatoes and crispy pancetta which was delicious!  Very simple and rustic with fresh ingredients and the right amount of seasoning.  It came with toasted bread which was perfect for dipping into the bowl.  My friend had the eggs over polenta with a mushroom ragu which he seemed to enjoy as well.  I only tasted the polenta which I thought was flavorful compared to the usual bland stuff at some restaurants.In terms of service, our waitress and the hostess were friendly and attentive.  I know they have only been open for 5 weeks, but I hope they keep things up.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back if only the B/C trains were more reliable.",2,0,0,Jimmy H.,"New York, NY",68,40,1
5.0,1/29/2012,"You don't normally think of a museum restaurant as offering exciting, delicious food, but Caffe Storico delivered.

4.0,1/8/2012,"Finally a stylish lunch spot on the UWS without a queue.  But probably not for long!  The restaurant is beautifully decorated with lots of light and air and gorgeous high ceilings.  But the atmosphere is casual despite all the chic-ness. Lunch was delicious - R and I shared some of the small plates.  The meatballs, the buratta and artichokes, the chicken liver bruschetta and the salad.  All really, really tasty - but the meatballs were some kind of fabulous. I could eat a bucketful of those meatballs.All this does not come cheap and portions are definitely on the ""good for girls"" end on the spectrum.  But it will be a delicious meal and as a bonus - just being in the New York Historical Society will make you feel more refined and intelligent!And - word to the wise - they are starting a Sunday brunch this week!",1,0,1,Lisa M.,"New York, NY",95,245,15
4.0,1/8/2012,"To commemorate the birthday of a freshly minted sexagenarian, I was charged with locating a restaurant that was ""special"" enough to match the occasion, somewhat upscale without astronomical prices or a terribly narrow dress code. It also had to be on the Upper West Side. Naturally, I turned to Yelp for guidance and, rather surprisingly, there weren't many appealing options within walking distance of our post-dinner destination. Something led me to the Starr website to check out Morimoto and Buddakan, despite being nowhere nearby, and that's where I discovered Caffe Storico. Not only did it meet all of the criteria, but for an extra dash of excitement, it was also to begin operations just three days before our visit.As others have mentioned, the dining room is gorgeous, airy and remarkable for its simplicity. Dress neatly but not formally; the waiters are in a uniform of collared shirts, dark jeans and black Converse sneakers. For diners, New York casual seemed to be the rule - as the dining room filled, we were awash in a sea of black turtlenecks. We started with a round of cocktails, all of which were delicious. They weren't the best I've had, but were still quite good. My Dante (Grey Goose, Averna, blood orange, rosemary) was tasty and refreshing. Although the menu is geared toward the fourteen cicchetti options (think Italian tapas), we ended up ordering one dish per person and treated them as appetizers. Minestrone soup, which was a special, was ""different"" but easily the best I've ever tasted. Arancini were fine, not terribly special. They should have been a bit larger or included one extra. The chicken liver was very good, as was the small-sized octopus & potato salad. If you plan on dining solely off of the cicchetti menu, I would recommend ordering at least 2-3 dishes per person. Entrées were similar in the sense that one really stood out, two were excellent and one was ""merely good."" My ricotta cavatelli (with lobster and black trumpet mushrooms) was phenomenal; plenty of lobster chunks and mushrooms with excellent housemade pasta. If I had stopped wolfing the dish down long enough to care about its singular flaw, I'd have mentioned that the mushrooms by themselves were a bit too salty. This dish is a real winner. The pappardelle with duck ragu, shaved chocolate and orange sounds bizarre, but works really, really well. This is a carryover dish from the chef's prior restaurant (see link at end of review), and it has most certainly earned its place on Storico's menu. Likewise a carryover, the roasted chicken (served with fennel and chanterelle mushrooms), won raves on its perfectly cooked chicken and well-paired flavors, but also a rant for its monochromatic presentation.The ""merely good"" dish was the sea bass. It was rather bland and, with a small herb salad, served atop equally underseasoned cannellini beans. When the manager visited our table seeking comments, she practically took the words out of our mouths regarding the chicken's presentation and the flavor (or lack thereof) of the fish dish. Other Yelpers have also mentioned the blandness of this particular preparation (see link at end of review).Desserts, like the two previous courses, were hits and ... less memorable hits. The standout here was the Chocolate Budino, served with drunken prunes and crème fraîche. My amaretto semifreddo was a bit on the icy side, served atop a somewhat overbaked cookie and surrounded by delicious sweet-squash caramel. Pumpkin gelato and apple crostata were very good, if not knockouts. The same can be said of the service, actually, which was at once confident but just slightly off (e.g., don't leave the person who finished a dish more quickly than the rest staring at an empty place setting). Pricewise, plan on spending approximately $75 per person for a couple drinks, an appetizer, entrée and dessert. A few of the dishes on the NY Times' preview menu sadly didn't seem to make the cut, including the tempting Risotto alla Kristina (with prosecco and oysters). To get a better feel for the cuisine - because several of the dishes & preparations I mentioned in this review seem to have carried over - check out the reviews for the chef's previous namesake (now closed) Philadelphia restaurant, James: yelp.com/biz/james-phila…. Caffe Storico is yet another brightly colored feather in Stephen Starr's cap. It is an Italian restaurant at heart, but done in a signature fashion that one might come to expect from a Starr establishment.",2,0,1,Colin P.,"Scranton, PA",91,225,309

4.0,1/4/2012,"This, along with Leopard at Cafe Des Artistes and Lincoln, is one of the most beautiful restaurants on the UWS. It's more casual and less expensive, but the food rivals Leopard (Lincoln is much more ambitious, and I love it). Portions are not small, not large, but sensible, and the servers are as sweet as caramel. I went for lunch, not dinner, so I can only comment on a slow UWS afternoon looking out on the Museum of Natural History, with fabulous arancini, a HUGE portion of chicken liver crostini, perfect burrata with artichokes three ways, and the cavatelli with lobster, my knew favorite pasta in the neighborhood. I'll be back. The wine list is not extensive but nice, and very affordable.

Ordered Alaska King Crab for $12 and it was served in plate the size of a side order of cole slaw from your local diner (and it looked just like it, too). It was served with two tiny pieces of stale Italian bread. I was starving after that so I ordered a salad. Expected superb presentation on the salad.

4.0,12/10/2011,"Caffe Storico is incredibly elegant. The place is illuminated by beautiful gold chandeliers and candles. The walls are adorned with dozens of gorgeous porcelain plates.  One of the walls exhibits a beautiful marble sculpture that customers can admire while eating.      Although the restaurant is very upscale, the atmosphere is surprisingly casual and far from pretentious. Most customers, and even the waiters, were wearing jeans. The dress code seems to be somewhere between casual and dressy.      The food is delicious! We started off with grissini breadsticks (pencil thick, crisp bread) and Italian bread with grape tomatoes + grapeseed oil dip. My boyfriend and I ordered: -Shrimp Tramezzini ($6): a must get! The tramezzini was so fresh and light. The citrus flavor and mayo balance out perfectly. Best deal for fresh shrimp sandwich in the city. -Langostino Fritto ($18): two pieces of fried squat lobsters paired with creamy cheese and grapefruit. Interesting textures and taste. -Ricotta Cavatelli ($22): Without a doubt, the pasta is Caffe Storico's specialty. The lobster and the black trumpet mushrooms were excellent. The handmade pasta itself was incredible. Great sauce. Bowl licking good. -Roasted Sea Bass ($28): The fish was so flavorful and complemented well with the cannellini beans and herb salad.-Apple Crustada ($10): It's a small apple pie, but with more crust than filling. It's heavenly with the vanilla ice cream. -Hazelnut Chocolate Gelato ($9) : Nutella ice cream is so amazing! The chocolate is incredibly rich and creamy. They also have many other special flavors of gelati and sorbets. Our server, Joseph, was excellent. The decor is beautiful and romantic. (Great place to bring a date!) The food is amazing. Caffe Storico is a great addition to Stephen Starr's restaurants.Note: Caffe Storico is open for brunch and lunch starting 12/14!",2,1,2,Emma C.,"Elmhurst, NY",175,135,499
