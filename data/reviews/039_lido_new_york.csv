4.0,4/26/2019,"Enjoyed dining here today after my workout. I've been here a few times in the past mostly for brunch but was excited to see a number of available lunch options on the menu and all for a whopping $12 bucks! You can't beat that deal for a well prepared meal!I decided to pick an item outside of the lunch menu options. Trying to stay on track- couldn't have a chicken burger and tasty zucchini fries after that workout lol.  So I decided to try one of the Insalate  options. Fresh arugula salad, complimented with warm roasted pears, shaved Parmesan, toasted walnuts and white basaltic vinaigrette. I decided to add grill chicken - All salads include the option to add a protein, $8 Chicken, $9 Shrimp and $12 for salmon. This was delicious!! The warmed pears were so flavorful along with the roasted walnuts which added texture. The   vinaigrette.....wrapped it up oh so nicely. Can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Ashley W.,"Manhattan, NY",4,46,53
5.0,4/23/2019,I ordered the blueberry pancakes and short rib Benedict and literally had to stop myself my eating my fingers. I also tried the spaghetti which tasted very fresh and authentic. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The presentation of all the food was also very well done. I do suggest making reservations for brunch since it's a pretty popular location.,1,0,0,Jessica P.,"New Orleans, LA",0,18,22

4.0,4/14/2019,I visited this location yesterday for brunch and I had a really good time. The music wasn't too loud I was able to interact with my friends without having to scream over loud music. The food was good even though I was limited on what to eat seeing that I'm still doing lent. But the blueberry pancakes with the restaurant made whip cream were so good. I also had some of the potatoes with the vinegar and rosemary which were also very good. The service was good too the host and hostess kept our coffee and water cups and mimosa glasses filled. The atmosphere was clean and we didn't have to wait along time to get seated which was a big plus for me.,0,0,0,Desmond F.,"New York, NY",6,20,75

Service friendly and remembered us when just two of us returned 3 days later. Food excellent!

3.0,4/3/2019,The food was tasty but nothing surprising. I felt like I didn't have much options but the main reason for the three stars is that it felt too expensive for an ordinary Italian meal,0,0,0,Mika K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0
4.0,3/30/2019,"Awesome bottomless brunch! $16 for 2 hours of unlimited mimosas is one of the best deals I've seen so far in NYC. My friend and I both got the polenta with mushrooms, truffle oil, and poached eggs. So tasty! Minus one star because there were large gaps of time in between when our server came to refill our glasses and check on us. There were quite a few times in the 2 hours when we had finished our waters/mimosas and had to wait a long time before someone came around for refills.  That being said, our food came out quickly and the restaurant was fairly busy at the time (Saturday at 1 PM) so it's understandable. Will definitely be back to try out more off the menu and get more mimosas!!",0,0,0,Lauren K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",234,35,69

Our waiter (Wesley) was very patient and so nice to our group. I had the short rib and got so full! Originally, I was going to get the French toast but it looked a little small on pictures so I'm glad I went with the short rib.

1.0,3/17/2019,"This was the most horrific experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I arrived and met my friend at the bar, we had a 7:30 reservation and was seated at 7:20 since we both arrived ready for table. The waiter (I failed to get his name unfortunately) came to the table scowling and looked disgusted. I gave my order and he quickly looked away, didn't provide any details or anything. My friend then told him, ""may I have a few more minutes i'm still reviewing"" and he looked at her with disgust and venom and just left the table and went to another waiter and proceeded to speak ill of us just because we asked for more time. I motioned to the manager and informed him and told him I will report this treatment to all media platforms. To be in the heart of W116th st in HARLEM and to treat two hard working black women as if it is a ""chore"" or an absolute disgusting thing to give us more time, when the restaurant was NOT crowded and there was plenty of waitstaff. We even had hunt down staff just to get a waiters attention, who ended up being nasty, rude and disrespectful. This restaurant needs to be shut down, point blank. That was beyond unprofessional and staff like that permeated a horrible unfriendly, unsightly energy in the entire restaurant. I am a hardworking native Brooklyn NY woman and Harlem means, fun, art, good food, good community; yet this restaurant is a mockery and a joke of what Harlem is supposed to be. Horrific experience. DO NOT GO. I will see to it this place is closed.",2,0,0,Jasmine L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,2,0
5.0,3/10/2019,"I went here for a Saturday brunch at around 1:30. We had the bottomless mimosas and our waiter Wesley was THE BEST!!! He refilled our drinks very quickly and kept the mimosas flowing and provided excellent service. Our food came out very quickly, probably 15 minutes or so after ordering and everything was so delicious. Even after we finished eating we had about an hour of mimosas left and Wesley kept pouring and never pressured us to hurry or leave. Plus, our drinks were pretty strong and we were having a great time. At the end of our two hours he brought the check and we payed quickly.

5.0,3/9/2019,"Great brunch. Amazing bottomless. The salmon Benedict was sooo good and my girl got the short rib Benedict and she loved it. We have been here almost two hours now. The staff here is just too friendly and has been too on top of things. I agreed to a Saturday brunch expecting to be in and out In an hour and to be offended by the service. Sadly our server was really attentive, on his game, I have had like 20 mimosas, and he is sexy and I think my sexual identity is at question.

4.0,2/15/2019,"Came to Lido for Valentine's Day. It was super packed, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes. To start we had the salt cod fritters, they were soooo good! I could've ordered another plate. For dinner I first got the lobster ravioli with fresh crab. The lobster tasted like imitation lobster and had a ""funky"" taste. I didn't like it and asked if I could send it back for the mussels (great choice). They give you a hefty serving and they were delicious. To drink, I had the camomila martini (I highly recommend this drink) it was really good.Over all my experience here was great, from ambiance to the wait staff.",1,0,0,Bee L.,"Brooklyn, NY",528,35,42
4.0,2/6/2019,"Lido, this place is one of a kind can make you love it and hate it at the same time. Our reservations was for 12:30p one of the party arrived and they seated her(which was amazing) they told her she had the table until 2:30 because there was another reservation to follow. Another from the party (me) cake at 12:45p but the time I got there the manager was threaten to cancel the whole reservation although half the party was here and we were already seated. That kinda rubbed me the wrong way because it was told we had the table until 2:30p we weren't aware the whole party had to be here if we were already seated. She then came back around 1:15p as we told her someone was walking in right now she what seemed like a passive aggressive gesture saying ""next time this can't happen"" okay that was the only down part. Let's talk service AMAZING. As soon as you sit they as what you want a mimosas are flowing. If you have bottomless you never going to see an empty cup. When we ordered the food came in about 15mins fastest service ever. And the food was amazing I would definitely recommend this place. After our time was up the manager did let us get 2 more drinks at the bar so that made up for the earlier incident. And guess what the prices are very affordable for 4 people and unlimited drinks it was $35 a person. Where are you finding that in NY. Love this place will def go back and recommend others to go",1,0,0,Miso J.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",154,15,12
4.0,2/1/2019,"Another Restaurant Week success!  I have been meaning to go to this Harlem neighborhood establishment and I am glad I did on one of the coldest nights ever.  The RW prix fixe menu is comforting.  We started with a vegan tomato soup and brussel sprouts and ricotta cheese (not photographed) and they were perfect.  Added a garlic bread and the trio was a great start to a perfect meal of steak and smashed potatoes and chicken marsala.   There are plenty of pasta options which I wanted to try but they were all dairy so I had to stay clear but my non-dairy choices were very satisfying.  My boyfriend's chicken marsala was moist and flavorful.  My medium rare steak was slightly under but was tender and solid nevertheless.  The horseradish sauce on the side was a classic and lovely accompaniment.. Only could have a few bites of the crepes which were laden with caramel sauce.  I did better with the bread pudding which was not too sweet. Definitely will return to this simple elegant cozy place.  I love the old black and white photos of celebrities on the wall, inspiring conversations and memories.",1,0,0,Wailana W.,"New York, NY",59,309,1103

4.0,1/14/2019,"Went here for my first time the other day, for brunch.  This was at 1200 noon on a Sunday.First off, reservations are clearly essential.  The place was full when we arrived, and this being on a very cold day.  (I'd imagine in the warmer months it's even more crowded.)The overall ambiance and decor of the place are very nice...cheery and very light.  The clientele there had a very nice energy overall.The food was terrific.  I got a biscuit with some type of a sweet relish, with scrambled egg and bacon.  Very tasty.The coffee was good.Service was attentive.The noise level was quite loud....a bit too loud for my taste.They pack the tables and chairs a bit too tightly.  We were seated just next to where the bar ends towards the back.  There was very little space for anyone to pass behind my chair and go around the corner of the bar.  I'm sure there must be lots of people bumping into chairs and the end of the bar.  Not a good setup, but then, clearly they want to maximize the available seating, to make more money.Would I return?  Probably 'yes', but preferably during hours where it's less crowded.  Seems like it would be nice to go just for a drink at the bar sometime.",1,0,0,Lisa e.,"New York, NY",54,320,20

I opted for the unlimited mimosa and boy oh boy, that's what I got. Not only does your waiter refill you but the hostess as well (if you're seated close). You definitely won't be waiting for a refill. Even when the glass is half empty, they're coming over to refill. The food was pleasant and the staff members were nice.Also, they had a clean bathroom.

The lamb chops came with a butternut squash hash and it was sooooo yummy! Everything was seasoned to perfection and the salmon melted in my mouth, but still had a slight crisp on the outside.

We were beyond offended and will never come back. Sadly, we have been regulars here pre-child, and now with a child, we feel like persona non-grata.  This restaurant is not for families and now not for us.

2.0,12/15/2018,"While I love Lido and frequent the restaurant often. I was extremely disappointed with my experience today, which was the first time I've done brunch on a Saturday in quite some time. The staff today chose to seat every party with black people at the back of the restaurant. The back section, with all black people was extremely crowded...I mean we were packed in shoulder to shoulder. While the front section had several tables open, but those who were seated in the front were all the non-black parties. This is the first time I've noticed this at Lido and curious if anyone else has experienced this? I did mention my concern with the restaurant manager, however it seems as though my comments were dismissed and fell on deaf ears. Such a shame for a restaurant with such great food.

3.0,11/12/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday to celebrate a birthday. After returning from Italy, Lido was just what I was looking for. Their Italian inspired brunch menu left me interested. Service: When I called to make reservations I was told that they did not take reservations and that we would have to come in person to wait on line. When it was our turn to be seated, I asked for an empty table that I saw inside. The female host was going to seat us there when a male host or manager came over and told her that we could not sit there because it was ""reserved"" (surprise surprise). The service did not get better from there. The food took a long time and the waiter was not attentive. I found myself spending more time trying to get his attention than actually enjoying the food. Food: Despite the service, the food was amazing. We ordered the mussels which were plentiful and flavorful. The sauce was delicious and paired well with the bread. We even asked for more bread to enjoy with the sauce. I had the baked French toast and was definitely impressed. I also had the eggs benedict which was decent. The restaurant is casual and relaxed. The bathroom is a little difficult to access when the restaurant is crowded. They offer a 2-hour bottomless option and the drinks are decent.

2.0,11/10/2018,"Where do I begin? - people were nice. Our waiter was cute and friendly but he left us after our food was ordered and disappeared for a long time and thats where the problems started. Our water glasses sat empty for 20 min. When we couldn't wait and asked for water. It took 3 times to finally get water. I asked for an extra set of utensils because I had a cold and didn't want to spread to my friend. They never came. Then we asked for the drink menu, also took 2 tries of desperately getting someone's attention with wild hand gestures. Finally our entrees, took an hour. We had mussels and sea base. They shouldn't take this long. Another table came and ordered the mussels too and a pasta and they came within 10 mins. We were stunned. No clue what happened there. They were pretty quick at clearing our plates and taking our bill. Our waiter came back when we ordered the second drink and it got better. So it's unclear what system is going on. Maybe the people we asked for help were not our server but why didn't they say something? They just nodded at our requests and never delivered. WTF?It's a restaurant full of waiters and it was half empty. They just walked up and down by the bar. Seem like a totally inefficient operation. Again, people were friendly but it was like everyone we spoke to had amnesia. Especially this guy with ponytail. We asked him for utensil, water and menu. Each time he acknowledged and nodded then walked away as if we never talked. Weirdest thing ever. Worst service ever in New York. The food was okay. Drink was okay.

Service is generally ok, although there was one time we had a sour-looking waiter who seemed can't wait to finish his shift and be done with for the night.  And this was in the middle of quite an early dinner, mind you.  Place can get noisy as there is a bar which is oftentimes full.  However, you can ask to be seated somewhere far from it and it'll be ok.  They also have tables outside during warmer weather.

We each got a Ruby cocktail which is just as interesting as it sounds! I enjoyed sipping it throughout the meal. On recommendation of our waiter, we got the salt cod fritters which were excellent! The fish was tender and the outside was nicely crispy. For the main dishes, we got the truffle gnocchi which was excellent. Our first dish of that had a piece of plastic in it, and they replaced it within ten minutes, but they didn't seem to be too bothered by it. Otherwise, we enjoyed the dish. Our other plate was the lamb ragu, which is a special. It was overall good, but the orange zest was so overpowering that it made it difficult to enjoy any other flavor in it.Overall, I would return for drinks, apps, and the gnocchi, as well as to enjoy the ambiance.",0,0,0,Marleigh S.,"New York, NY",11,168,29

The food was great, and also the coffee was good but I didn't really get to enjoy the experience completely (might be my fault) - since we didn't save a table before, we had to sit outside and it was freezing, so the food got cold fast and the coffee was constantly cold. The waiter said there's no space inside and I think he kind of forgot to tell us if there's a space after we sat outside. But overall it has a great potential and the inside is beautiful. I got the pancakes and my friend got the french toast.

Then the spaghetti came back out for the second time and it was cold and the meatballs (because they were cold) were kinda hard.  The sauce wasn't hot any longer and it was just disappointing.  The service was unprofessional.  It wasn't horrible but my experience was less than satisfying.",1,0,0,Max R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0

The nectarines themselves tasted great, so I didn't mind it too much, but the pancake itself was a little dry and not my favorite.

I was visiting my family in Harlem, and my brother recommended this spot, as he's a fan of the bottomless mimosa special. We were a party of four, and the hosts greeted us warmly. The ambiance was great, there is a lot of space indoors and out - nice, classic New York vibe. Pretty obviously gentrified, but not as over the top as some of the newer spots. Service was moderate - may be our fault, as we were talking and catching up, and had to ask for ""one more minute"" at least three times - after that, our server disappeared for awhile and was consistently hard to track down throughout the meal.We ordered the salmon Benedict (my cousins loved this - it looked great! Colorful and fresh fish, great presentation). I ordered the entree that has roasted potatoes, spinach, onions and some protein (i've forgotten exactly), and was not impressed. The mean comes on a bed of vidalia onions that were so caramelized, the sweetness overtook the dish and jarred with the potatoes and eggs. The spinach was not overcooked, which is great, but overall, not a good dish. The coffee was good - the orange juice was fresh - everything was just ""fine"". The price wasn't terrible either.

4.0,10/3/2018,"Lido is definitely a Harlem staple! I decided to partake in the bottomless brunch, so I came up here with some friends. The brunch deal is this; it's $16 for unlimited mimosas for 2 hours. The mimosas were nice, translucent yellow color; if you get an opaque mimosa, run, because you're basically drinking straight OJ. Fortunately, that wasn't the deal at Lido.I ordered the white polenta with mushroom ragu + poached egg + truffle oil + parmigiano reggiano, a side of bacon, and bread pudding with coffee ice cream. The polenta was pretty much perfect; it was creamy and tasty. I wasn't a huge fan of the bread pudding; it wasn't warm nor was it sweet enough. It had more of a pound cake type of texture versus a bread pudding texture.I appreciated how they ensured our glasses were always filled, and they made sure we enjoyed our $16 worth of mimosas.

Many other places I've been to are pretty slow at refills, so the amount you get for the price here is amazing.If you're looking for a place to only eat brunch, this place probably isn't worth it, as the food is on the pricier side for the portions you get.

I came here with a friend who was visiting and it was a great brunch experience! Harlem has some delicious food, and Lido is definitely included in that group. What I liked about this brunch was there was a wide and unique array of food options. Most bottomless brunches are usually the same thing: Eggs Benedict, Huevos Rancheros, etc. and while Lido had those on the menu, they had some awesome and less trendy dishes. I had the Sausage Omelet which was scrumptious. It had lots of bits of meat and goat cheese and I could've kept eating it all day. My friend had the poached eggs over herb roasted potatoes. That was also very good, however the side salad served with it was kinda weird (there was no dressing on it so it felt more like a garnish).

We did as we were told but as soon as the party left to be seated another couple jumped the line and took the seats. I walked over to them and explained that we were waiting for the seats as per the host but they got upset and refused to move. I walked over to the host to solve the problem but she just said she was busy and walked away. My husband spoke to the bar tender, who knew we were waiting since he gave us a menu before, but he seemed to be friends with the couple who sat and just ignored us as well. The couple started arguing with us to move and said ""this was his black neighbor hood and we don't belong here"". Again no help from the staff. We came here to have a good time and it was ruined.

2.0,5/2/2018,"Let me just start by saying I expected so much more after all the great reviews I read on yelp. Unfortunately, I was extremely dissatisfied with the service I received. On Monday I called to make reservations for two the following day. It was celebratory lunch for my best friend's birthday. We were greeted by a very rude hostess who just looked at us and asked us ""Yes?"" I explained we had reservations and we were seated. Literally one minute later our waitress abruptly shows up to our table and says ""have you guys decided what you want?"" We tell her we just sat down and she retorts ""it's just food shouldn't be that difficult."" I was extremely offended by her lack of patience and the comments made. When we were still eating she came to the table to ask if we were done- which we clearly weren't, multiple times. The entire time we felt like we were being rushed to get out of the restaurant.

I forgot my favorite leather jacket on the back of my chair one day a couple weeks ago and when I realized and came back a couple hours later it was nowhere to be found. There was no sign of it but they said they would call me if it turned up. Which it hasn't.We were sitting directly behind the hostess's station and it was quite busy, so our table was only likely empty for a couple minutes while they were bussing it. So in that time, either a random patron at the restaurant stopped by the empty table and stole it before it was bussed, or one of the staff stole it. I realize I am partially at fault for forgetting it, but are the staff here really so busy and forgetful that they don't notice when an item is stolen? And shouldn't they be at least a little concerned that theft is happening in their restaurantunder their noses?Either way, I will never return to a place whose staff have so little concern for their customers.

The chicken piccata, however, was tender and tasty, but was not outstanding.  The fresh tuna over a salad was just ok.  It was not seasoned well, but it was cooked exactly to order.  The salad wasn't special or interesting.  If we're up in the area again, we'll give it another try.

2.0,4/3/2018,Went here on a Monday night. Place was busy which Was a positive sign. Cocktails were good. Service was just ok. Our waiter looked like he was hating life. Food was meh! Everything was bland. Octopus was rubbery. Chicken livers were over cooked to a point that they tasted really old. Both items were removed from our check. The spaghetti was meh! Meatballs could have been better. And then entree chicken was with some hard artichokes. And was two super thin slices of chicken breast. For the amount of money we paid I wanted a whole chicken breast. After this we went to another restaurant to have apps as we were still hungry.

The place was PACKED but we were seated right away despite being a few minutes late. We chose to go with the bottomless mimosas and they were great, 70% champagne for sure. Our waiter, Wesley, was awesome! He did not let our glasses go less than halfway empty ever. The food was everything! We had the spaghettini with grilled shrimp (the sauce is very tart but delicious nonetheless), the buttermilk biscuit with chipotle-honey butter and scrambled eggs/bacon (I'm still dreaming about that biscuit, so perfect), and two orders of the creamy garlic parmesan bread because it was THAT good. The lido sundae, which we had as dessert, deserves an honorable mention as well. The restaurant is perfect for big groups as there's a lot of seating but note it's not really a party brunch because the music is pretty low.

1.0,3/29/2018,"I was excited to come here because it's around the corner from my apartment, so I was ready to be nothing but positive, and my expectations actually weren't that high. The pastas dishes we got were bland and watery. They reminded me of what I make at home - no finesse at all and/or frozen dinner texture (I kind of think it was all frozen food, seriously.) I won't pay money for this again. Sometimes with places like this, the bar is the saving grace for me; but yet again, no. The wine list is fine, but not enough for me to come back again and again. The cocktails - my husband and I always just order the classics, so we're not talking rocket science here - they were way off base! Literally, wrong. Bartenders had no idea what was going on. Trying to like this place, and it prevented me at every turn.This place just doesn't really have any standards. If you're in the neighborhood, go to RDV instead.

The bottomless brunch they have is amazing and their bartenders are always on it. ESPECIALLY if you are sitting at the bar for brunch, which I highly recommend. The food for brunch wasn't particularly hardy but taste great. But the good side to that is the menu changes every season so there is always something new to try. Their black squid ink pasta is amazing! The service is good at Lindo. Waiters handle service very well and feel free to ask them about the menu. The drinks at Lidos are wonderful as well. They. Have a drink infused with lavender that is so good, and obviously quiet aromatic and relaxing. For the experience expect to spend but its all worth it.

If I had written this review a few months ago I would've certainly given it 5 stars however my last two encounters were subpar and I am very hesitant about returning.Brunch: The short rib hash benedict & truffle white polenta are amazing. If you decide to do bottomless definitely try to sit at the bar since like many NYC brunches, the service to refill mimosas can be annoying. Expect a decent wait time since brunch is very busy. During my last attempt at brunch I was given a wait time of about 45 minutes. It was not a big deal since I did not have a reservation and I was able to leave my phone number to be called when a table was available. I decided to go food shopping at a nearby supermarket to waste time. After an hour of no call back, I called them to see how much longer. They informed me another 30 minutes, I was annoyed but said okay. 40 minutes later, and I am super annoyed so I called back AGAIN. The hostess informed me she thought I cancelled when I called the first time. ??? Not sure where she got that from but maybe they need to find hostesses who are better at communication and multitasking.Dinner: Definitely nothing special and bordeline unappetizing. I got the grilled octopus during restaurant week and could not even eat it since it was extremely slimy and chewy. Server did not bother to ask why the plate was basically untouched.

And order the filet Mignon and spaghetti and meatballs as entreesss....  While we are waiting for our aps, a nice white couple sit in the table immediately next to us and place their order....  Somehow they get their aps before us,  at this point we've waited 30 mins or so, but when we finally get our apps and the garlic Parmesan bread is cold ND the calamari is also soggy and kind of cold. Then they also get their meals before us (considering we basically ordered the same thing). At this point I'm upset because I couldn't comprehend how this transpired, but I'm hungry and am eagerly waiting for my meal,  so another 10 to 15 mins go by and my boyfriend finally decideds to ask our waiter, ""hey just wondering when are our entrees coming out?"" the waiter says he's going to go check on it. And he comes back to tell us they are working on it.  5 mins later we finally get our entrees. Now let me tell you, my boyfriend asked for a medium rare to medium steak,  he received basically a rare steak that was still bleeding profusely without even being cut into and my spaghettis were extremely soggy and sloppy looking....  I wished I would of taken pictures but my phone was dead and I was just so upset.  At the service, at the waiter, at the food, I've never felt so insulted I don't wanna say it was racist because I wish it was not but it sure felt like that type experience. I know things get mixed up in the kitchen sometimes but come-on their aps and entrees first and our orders were not up to par.

3.0,1/15/2018,"I went for the first time to this location this past Sunday and took my parents to enjoy a good brunch in Harlem, I get there and I was asked if I had a reservation and I said no because I called the day before and I was told that I didn't have to make a reservation that I can simply walk-in.  I was then told that in order to sit inside a reservation had to be made so therefore I had the option to sit at the bar or outside in a covered heated patio.  I was not happy about this and told them that they need to work on being honest with their customers over the phone.  We sat outside and it was still cold, even though it was heated and I just worried because my parents are elderly.  The food was excellent and so were the unlimited mimosas, but it just bothered me that I couldn't fully enjoy my brunch because we were still so cold sitting outside in the semi-heated patio.  Overall, great food, but if your going to have a heated patio make sure its HEATED and also make sure to be honest with your future clientele when they call and ask questions about reservations and walk-ins.",0,0,0,Daisy C.,"New York, NY",1,26,2
5.0,1/15/2018,"My boyfriend and I finally made it here for brunch and were super jazzed to try the Harlem mainstay. I had the poached eggs over roasted potatoes, and he the buttermilk biscuit with scrambled eggs. The food was absolutely delicious and we couldn't even finish it all! It also came out super fast. Ambience is classy and I love the sage green color scheme. Definitely will be back for dinner sometime! 4.5 stars.Edit 2/2018: Returned for dinner during Restaurant Week in winter 2018 and had a great meal. The Brussels sprouts were tasty, and the polenta fries were fantastic. Arugula salad with pear was very nice. I did think the pumpkin ravioli was a bit watery, so that was disappointing. Bread pudding dessert rocked. I think I enjoyed brunch here more, but I'd recommend Lido for either meal!",2,1,1,Gab G.,"New York, NY",208,1651,5011

I made a reservation and we were promptly seated inside.Food: There were a few omelet dishes, paninis and pasta dishes. I ordered a spicy pork sausage omelet, it was great.We also ordered a few sides: meatballs, home fries and bacon - all great!The only unfortunate part of the service was that our 4 main dishes came out super quick, but no sides. After a couple of minutes we asked about the sides and it seems like they weren't put in properly. we ended up waiting 20+ min for the sides, at that point we ate our mains because they were getting cold. I saw other tables get the same sides while we were waiting so it was clear they didn't try to expedite ours ahead of the other orders.This was unfortunate as the food and servers were great. The staff did comp the sides which was a nice gesture, but it was disappointing nonetheless .I'm hoping this was a fluke and def. willing to give this place another try, maybe for dinner next time!",2,0,1,Hansel B.,"Manhattan, NY",104,511,484

My suggestion is to come in early, or have reservations. I had the braised short rib hash on an english muffin, topped off with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, which was absolutely delicious.  I normally have the hollandaise sauce on the side because most pour too much sauce, but this dish had the right amount of sauce and short rib hash ratio.  The portion of hash was plenty and the size greens were a perfect balance. My friend and I shared the apple pancakes and to my surprise, it was a stand out.

5.0,9/15/2017,"It is a few years later but Lido is still kicking it up in Harlem with the same great brunch menu and local crowd. That is pretty impressive to me because Harlem is gentrifying like mad and a lot of new businesses (even Whole Foods) are entering the market. I think the reason Lido remains so successful is because they consistently deliver on food and experience, and are a fixture of the neighborhood.The ambiance is chic yet warm - somehow the décor manages to be very stylish yet casual and approachable. Even though the restaurant is narrow and generally quite busy it avoids feeling claustrophobic, the exception perhaps being when a line of bottomless Mimosa-laden folks forms for the restroom.The staff here are always on point and don't have too much turnover. The place is exceptionally busy on the weekend. Everyone seems on top of things yet still manage to be fun and friendly. They have the right amount of urgency to provide good service without also looking pained or stressed.My favorite brunch dish to order is the 'White Polenta, Truffle Oil, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Poached Eggs.' For the carnivores amongst my friends recommend the brisket hash and smoked salmon benedict. And of course when you're at Lido you must get a bottomless mimosa. The bottomless here is an excellent deal because the ratio of sparkling to OJ is solid (at least 4:1) and the staff constantly refill everyone. I challenge you to get more than halfway through your glass before it is topped up again. You may be feeling very merry by the end, but isn't that what bottomless brunch is all about?Although I usually just brunch here the dinner menu here is also very decent. As an additional incentive to get folks in seats late night Lido has started doing a late night happy hour on Friday nights where they offer 2 for 1 drinks from 10:30pm until close. Definitely worth checking out.So to conclude:* Brunch skillets - just do it* Bottomless mimosas - it would be rude not to* Make a reservation and be on time for it - this place is popular* Late night happy hour on the weekend - you know you want to...and that's all folks!",6,1,4,Cri C.,"New York, NY",283,238,1702

3.0,9/9/2017,"This place was just okay in all aspects. The brunch menu is a decent size, but unimaginative-- your standard brunch fare of Benedicts, omelettes, and French toast, accompanied by traditional mimosas and bloody Mary's. To start, I had a Bloody Mary. It was good, nothing noteworthy, but a rather small glass. For my entree, I chose the short rib hash Benedict. The waiter assured me that there wouldn't be mostly potatoes in the hash, and that there'd be a good portion of short rib, and he was correct. Definitely no shortage of meat when the entree arrived to the table. However, something was off because the sauce from the short ribs made the English muffin base soggy and inedible. As for the flavor, also just okay. I wound up asking for some Tabasco sauce to liven it up. My bf ordered an omelette that I took one bite of and didn't want any more. My cousins ordered the French toast which was just a piece of Italian bread, grilled in butter, served with fruit, syrup, and whipped cream. The atmosphere inside was LOUD. I don't know anything about acoustics, but my god. Everything was amplified and I felt like everyone was yelling. Our waiter was also inattentive.

Once came for dinner - sat outside at the table closest to sidewalk on a warm summer night. Our appetizer never came, and my black ink pasta was tasty but completely clamped together in giant chunks. Drinks, juice needed 2-3 reminders. At some point a giant rat literally ran across our feet towards the trashcan. We asked to be moved (although the 5-year old was rather excited about the rat), didn't have problems there.

The dim lighting and soft music provided for a great date night ambiance, as do both the outside seating and indoor booth seating.I wasn't a fan of the sauce that accompanied the bread, but that may just be that I'm not big on olives, which the sauce tasted strongly of.I got the Pan-Seared Scallops with Beet Risotto. I was disappointed with the risotto as it was overwhelmingly beet flavored with little other flavors to balance the palate. The scallops provided some of the necessary balance and were amazingly cooked; however, there were only 4 pieces. My boyfriend's Spaghetti with Veal Meatballs was average. The spaghetti and sauce were alright, but nothing of noteworthiness. The veal meatballs were seasoned very well; however, they were a tad on the dry side.Overall, I'm disappointed with how this dinner went.

5.0,7/20/2017,Having brunch at Lido with the bestie. Sonia Vann you know I have to have the mussels and wine Albarino. Btw we saw Common going into Lido when we were coming out. He hugged me but he seemed like he was in a hurry so we didn't ask for a pic. He sure was nice and handsome though. The food was excellent and Serena (the executive chef not the ex-girlfriend/gorgeous tennis superstar)was so open and approachable. In fact she approached my friend and I and shared her desire to come back as a black man after her current life. I loved her eccentric coolness. As a black woman in this oppressive world Serena showed herself to be an ally in the plight of the black community. Not bad for the executive chef who happens to be a white woman. I'm impressed.

5.0,7/18/2017,"Fantastic food and delightful servers are typically the meat and potatoes of any 5 star restaurant review. However, there's something more to be said for service recovery and a staff's ability to ensure satisfaction by making good for a guest when things are kind of tough. Things got off to a rocky start when we had a reservation, were seated promptly, and then left alone for nearly ten minutes. You know that moment - when you say to yourself, ""Shit, we might be in trouble here."" The restaurant was HOT (because it was 92 degrees outside and they had a dining room completely full of guests). Once we finally raised a flag to say ""Help!"" the staff at Lido did more than one might imagine to make the experience amazing for us. Aside from the personable connection, service was prompt, follow up was determined, and they truly wowed us until we walked out the door. They covered our dessert - and that was all we'd LET them cover. They offered to comp our entire meal.

I was able to make a reservation on OpenTable and we were seated promptly upon our arrival. The restaurant is a bit loud - so if you're expecting to come here to have a nice quiet conversation then you may need to look elsewhere. We got a round table right next to the window so it wasn't too loud for us. This place can accommodate relatively large groups so it might be a good spot for a celebration.I ordered the grilled lamb chops over a bed of barley and black rice pilaf. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the dish comes with 4 pieces. The lamb was tender, juicy and delicious. My only complaint is that I wish there were more! The barley/black rice pilaf is very flavorful and has a bunch of great stuff in it like hazelnuts, squash and plum chutney.My wife had the squid ink linguine. By all accounts it was solid. I had a small taste of it and I really enjoyed the tomato sauce that has garlic chilies and orange zest.We will probably be back some time in the future as this place is a solid choice for dinner out in Harlem.",0,1,1,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",288,574,317

Thankfully it was a beautiful day so we were more than happy to sit outside. I ordered the white polenta with poached eggs, truffle and mushroom ragu. Phenomenal. The polenta was so creamy and rich, kinda wish there were more mushrooms, the eggs were perfectly poached, and it was topped with a little Parmesan cheese. Yum. It also came with a crusty piece of bread (wish it came with 2 pieces to really soak up all the flavor!) It's something I've never seen on a brunch menu so I had to try it and it payed off.

First timer imperssion - Nice decor, but nothing over the top. Cozy and by that I mean seating gets tight...fast. Every person that walked past me (mostly staff) kicked/bumped my chair. I wasn't sitting far out from the table either. Food was tasty. We had the crab cake (yes, there's only one, but it's larger than average) and calamari for appetizers. Both were delicious. Entrees consisted of the Atlantic salmon with mashed potatoes and spinach and the filet mignon with asparagus, potatoes and fried onion strings. Both were pretty tasty but my steak was well done and I asked for medium. We had the Lido sundae for dessert which was amazing. Definitely recommend it.The Lido mule was phenomenal. I love mules and this one is now one of my favorites. The pineapple mojito left a little to be desired. Overall, we had a great time. We don't live anywhere near here; we don't even live in the city.

The lasagna was outstanding--and again they were very responsive when one of us said hers looked over cooked. It was whisked away and replaced within a few minutes. The wine list has a nice variety.

3.0,5/7/2017,"We were a party of 4 on a Friday at 7pm, they only seat you when the whole party is present, pretty standard. We all ordered a drink and 2 apps for the table, an entree each and 1 dessert to share because we were stuffed. We paid a little under $50 each including the 20% tip. Service  was pretty bad....the server kept forgetting about 1 person at the table...the drink and the entree. Ordering food also took forever, maybe it was his first day? Anyway, we weren't in a rush so it was fine. The people there were a nice mix, casual and afterwork crowd, some families and some on dates. Now onto the food: We ordered the Burrata, Currants Agrodolce, Roasted Holland, Peppers, Fresh Oregano crostini, with all of the ingredients you wouldn't expect for it to be as bland as it was...also it was tiny for $10 and not actually like crostini at all. The Parmesan polenta fries (5 per order) were better but the olive dip was a little strange. The entrees were salmon, mushroom lasagne, spaghetti and meatballs and the gnocchi in sage and Parmesan cream sauce. The entrees were definitely much much better. I personally ordered the gnocchi and it was really great with a ton of fresh chopped sage. It was super rich but delicious. The tomato sauce in the spaghetti dish was pretty decent but I can be pretty picky about tomato sauce. Fish was perfectly seared medium rare and lasagna was nice. For dessert we just all wanted a taste of something sweet so we went for the lemon cheesecake with strawberry sorbet, not bad but I don't think I'd order it again. The question I guess is would I go back? Yes, I can dismiss the poor service as an off day but if I do go back I would probably order a salad and the gnocchi. I'd probably pick up a cookie at Le Vain across the street before dinner to satisfy the sweet tooth.",0,0,0,Anne C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,13

2.0,4/1/2017,"I have come here a few times in the past. Always had a great time and the food was delicious. To say I was shocked by my recent experience is an understatement. First, it was a rainy Friday the restaurant was half empty. They have one , tiny umbrella rack and upon entering you are greeted with a few dozen umbrellas thrown on the floor. You literally have patrons squatting and going  through the pile of umbrellas on the floor to find theirs. Given my umbrella was black and there at 8 more like mine not fun to do. Please buy another umbrella rack!  As mentioned the restaurant was half empty, yet they insisted on sitting everyone bunch together in one section of the restaurant. It also appears as if they have tried to put a few more two seater tables. I literally felt claustrophobic and I am use to tight seating in restaurants in Manhattan. Our server was adequate. The appetizer the butternut squash soup was lackluster. Honestly, had better soup from the hot bar at Whole foods. Our pasta dish same results bland, and severed slightly above room temperature. The lemon and white chocolate cheesecake was average. So for $130, we got bland, average food and wine not chilled properly. Too many choices in the area and at this price point!

I've been here for brunch at least 3 times and I will say one downside is that some of the entrees are a little small, especially if you're coming hungry. Today definitely hit the spot though with the short rib Benedict and the Italian sausage omelette which my boyfriend got. The egg on the Benedict was perfectly done- expect to snap that #yolkporn.

2.0,3/22/2017,"I've come to Lido in the past and had a wonderful experience! However, I came with a friend recently for brunch and I must say, I was very shocked this time around. Aside from my awesome cocktail (I had the Camomilla Martini, which was well balanced and definitely not light on the booze), the food and service were very lackluster. My friend and I both ordered the short rib hash, with scrambled eggs as opposed to the poached -- the hash was bland, lacked texture (mush is pretty accurate) and was skimp on the potato. It was served over an engish muffin which wasn't toasted and became soggy, and my eggs were dry. To make up for the lack of potato in the hash we attempted to order a side of their potatoes, but they were out. The only upside to my plate was the side salad that had a very tasty dressing. The service could also use some improvement, but wasn't the worst that I've experienced.

2.0,3/15/2017,"At 600+ reviews with 4 stars, I figured this was the perfect place to take my friend for her birthday. She's a pretty amazing cook and since we're both big time foodies, I didn't want to go to yet another place that made us feel like ""we should have saved money and made better food at home"". But in this case....we probably should have. Upon arrival, I was not disappointed. The ambiance was very nice. A subtlly-upscale restaurant with lots of natural light and a tasteful decor. The service was a little slow especially considering there were only a few other parties there, but I got the feeling our waiter was picking up a lot of slack from the other employees who seemed like they spent most of their time standing around talking to each other. We got unlimited mimosas for brunch and I will admit that they did keep them coming! Even by our third glass, the mimosas were still delicious and never watered down...unlike a lot of the other so-called bottomless brunch dining experiences I've had in the city. For brunch we both got the braised short rib hash. Maybe we should have tried different things and split them- cause we were both completely underwhelmed. The short rib hash lacked flavor and texture. It kind of reminded me of fancy feast for humans. The eggs were a little over done, the side salad was drenched in whatever mediocre dressing it came with and the hollandaise sauce was almost non existent- which was doubly disappointing since the yolk of my poached egg was more solid than liquid. Maybe they doubled up on salad dressing to accommodate for the lack of hollandaise. Was it the worst thing I've ever eaten? No. Was it the best? Definitely not. I guess what I'm saying is that for the price, the food and service could use a makeover to match the interior design.",5,2,1,Royalti J.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,45,1

2.0,3/6/2017,A few years ago I gave this place 5 stars after several great experiences. NOW - I have to concur about some other reviews here of the current brunch service. Brunch food used to be great - as good as the rest of their menu. But - although the service remains good and bottomless Mimosas generous - the food is terrible. As stated in other reviews - it appears much if not all the food is pre-made. On my smoked salmon Benedict - the poached eggs were cold (like refrigerated) - the sauce was ice cold - English muffin not even toasted. And all 8 plates at our table came out within 5 minutes of ordering. Faster than you can crack and poach an egg. The other 7 dishes at our table were similarly cold and badly pre-cooked. Hmm.

2.0,3/4/2017,"So I came here on a Saturday morning for my friend's birthday brunch. I was very underwhelmed. To start off, it took about 15 min for the waitress to finally take our orders. About midway through waiting for our food, my glass was tipped over by someone walking by and it shattered- mimosa EVERYWHERE. A hostess saw it happen, made eye contact with me, and walked away. She didn't even signal someone to come clean it up. We had to flag down someone on the waitstaff ourselves- and all they did was sweep the glass off the table and the floor (and in doing this, swept a shard onto me that got stuck in my leg). They left the table AND THE FLOOR wet. No one brought us extra napkins and I had to request someone to bring another glass. I would love to say I'm being dramatic and it was probably a fluke and I'll be back- but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth.

5.0,2/7/2017,"It was restaurant week and I wanted to try some place new and in my neighborhood.  Found Lido on OpenTable and made reservations and was seated upon arriving in a timely manner.  We got seated at the 2 top behind the hostess stand which I think was the best seat in the house.  Prime lighting for the awesome photos I am sharing with you all.For starters, they bring out this nice crusty bread with tapenade that I could taste hints of garlic in.  For those who are not familiar with tapenade it is a dish that is minced or pureed olives, olive oil, and anchovies.  Here is your warning now - IT IS ADDICTING!!!   When ordering my appetizer, I did order from their regular menu for the fried calamari with chipotle aioli.  This must be the most tender calamari I have EVER had in MY LIFE, and tasted great with or without the aioli sauce if you are not big on spice.  The calamari was so tender it almost felt like it was melting in my mouth.  For my entrée, I ordered the rigatoni with pan seared spicy Italian sausage, Holland peppers, onions, and fresh herbs.  The rigatoni was a lighter pasta dish than I expected it due to the sauce not being heavy.  The other person I was dining with ordered the pan seared red snapper with orange beurre blac, autumn vegetables, and mozzarella gratin.   Being the good friend I am I did steal a couple pieces off their plate to try and it was cooked to perfection.  It had a perfect crust but moist and tender as well.Overall I feel as if Lido is a great spot for a date, grabbing a drink at their beautiful bar, or a great casual dining experience.  You got a new regular that is for sure!",5,3,5,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",562,339,583
1.0,2/6/2017,"Rarely does a restaurant give me an experience (great or terrible) that rises to the level of urging me to take all the necessary steps to enter a yelp review. But after being an advocate and very frequent Lido visitor  (multiple times a week, knew all the staff by name), I decided to take my dollars elsewhere. This Saturday I eagerly encouraged my friend to celebrate her birthday at Lido. As soon as we sat down, I requested, as I have so many times before, the substitution of orange juice for another juice in the mimosa due to an allergy.  Without battering an eye the waiter vehemently shook his head no. I then asked to speak to the manager who after several excuses walked away to consider our suggestion to let us mix the juice and champagne ourselves so I could forgo the orange juice since she wouldn't agree to presenting the mimosa with another juice.  She returns to tell us this is a reoccurring problem, she contacted the owner and the owner would not allow any accommodations. As we continued to talk about it, I inform her I know the owner, she has been in the restaurant during other times I've requested this and she has agreed to this alteration with little to no push back. She then says she will bring up this issue with the owner. Wait... I thought you spoke with the owner about this specific instance and she said no to this particular request. With this finding of untruthfulness, we decided to take our financial support to Blujeen, a block away. The food was absolutely fantastic, the unlimited drinks were amazing and it all came at a better price. As someone who patronized Lido from its inception, I would advise that it's much harder to get a new customer than to keep an old one.

2.0,1/12/2017,"MODIFIED REVIEW:After having dinner at Lido, I thought to myself ""Men.... maybe I should have dined here a year or so ago"" when this establishment first opened because my experience really didn't live up to the 'excitement' that I've read about in other reviews. Why didn't I experience the aforementioned thrill of dining at Lido?  Maybe, the stars were not aligned that day or, it was the approach that I took to dining there.  I think it was mostly the latter.  Regardless, if you read my reviews, I dislike leaving negative feedback because running a restaurant business is extremely challenging: there are so many intangible factors that can have a positive or perilous affect.Anyway, I used OpenTable to book my table for 2 adults.  Sadly, the restaurant informed me that they didn't receive my online reservation request.  That's not Lido's fault, it was an OpenTable online application issue.  Some people are always quick to blame a restaurant for anything. Keep it positive peeps.  Regardless, the hostess said that she will get me what appeared to be the only table available that night (Wednesday) and I was appreciative of that.  Seat location on a 1 to 10 scale: 4 - I'll explain more later but I decided to deal with it because this was my first time and I wanted to take in the Lido experience.  I also brought a friend with me.Appetizer: Calamari -  For some reason, i thought it was a bit over fried but nothing to die about.  Maybe, I was being too subjective.  Maybe, I was moody.  Lol.  Regardless, I thought there was no need for me to complain or send it back  Yup, I still went ahead and devoured it. Entree: Special of the Day - Ravioli with pumpkin filling.  Overall, on a 1 to 10 scale?  7  It was very DELICIOUS...but....the only problem was that the portions were for a super model trying to lose weight. :)  I'm 6'3 and I came with an appetite.My date later informed me that her entree (Brussel sprouts) was a bit oily or overcooked.  But she said her veal meatballs were good.My Harlem Renaissance beer tasted great and she enjoyed her Prosecco.Dessert was also very delicious, which I'm glad I didn't skip.Interior DesignThe environment and interior design of the restaurant is well thought out, cute and appears cozy, especially IF you snag a decent table.  Unfortunately, that night, our table was just not optimal because I was not able to properly face my companion.   My seat was hedged next to a column and my back was 3 feet from the bar, which was the main source of foot traffic into the dining area.  The set up of the table did not allow my companion and I to truly face each other or be in close body contact with each other which negated on the dining experience.  Normally, one could just correct that but It appeared to be the only table available at that time and I was eager to eat some food.Overall summary: I've lived in Harlem for ages and I along with old and new residents are gung-ho to see well-designed/themed restaurants pop up on Frederick Douglas Avenue and, in Harlem, in general. I found the interior design of the establishment to be cozy, clean and warm.  I also found it to be a bit tight as not spacious enough. But this is New York: space is at a premium. Will I be back?  At first, I thought I wouldn't because the overall dining experience was not as expected.  I equated it to the amount of money that I spent and I felt unfulfilled because I spent 2 weeks in Rome, a decade ago, and their dining experiences spoiled me. I was seeking to replicate that experience at Lido.  But upon further research that week, this is the principle, below, that I failed to apply at Lido, so it's not entirely their fault: ""The Italian menu is designed so that you choose dishes from various categories rather than only one. (So, if you're a hungry giant like me, come focused. Lol) For lunch you will have a plate of pasta (a primo), cleared away once it is done to make room for the next plate (a secondo) which will have a meat or fish on it. After the meat comes the salad or vegetables (contorno). For dessert, Italians usually have fruit or nuts."" I had Grappa. Chink!Now, after doing that research, and thanks to the owner and chef for reaching out to me to express their concern, I'm looking forward to dining there again to seek a diff. experience.  Based on my appetite, I'll make sure that I come with heavy pocket$, and without a date. LOL.Cheers!",6,3,3,Sir Choclet ..,"Manhattan, NY",4,40,57
3.0,1/10/2017,"I went recently for brunch. I ordered the blueberry pancakes for I believe $14. For that amount I felt the pancakes were a little small and should have came with a side. It was good but definitely not one of the best blueberry pancakes I've eaten. I decided to go with the bottomless mimosa for an additional $16. To make sure it was economical I compared the price for one glass and it was $9 so it made sense to me to just go with the bottomless option which has a two hour limit. The pancakes were gone before I knew it and I'm a slow eater so if you are a full grown adult and you brought an appetite, go with a side or two to fill you up.

I am definitely going back. I enjoyed the French Toast. It wasn't what I expected as far as it being the typical French toast. I believe it was actually french bread. My taste buds were tantalized!!!

3.0,11/9/2016,"Located in Harlem, Lido is a quaint little restaurant that is well-known for their boozy brunch. I came here for dinner and liked the apps, but was not WOWed by the main courses. 3.5 stars for me - I would round up, but service was meh so 3 stars on Yelp.*Wild Fig Jam Crostini - we were debating whether we should get this, so glad we did! Probably one of our favs of the night. Very thin and crispy crostini topped with delicious fig jam and pear. Yummy! Not overly sweet.*Grilled octopus - pretty tender, but still chewy. Don't expect it to melt in your mouth, but that's how octopus should be in my opinion. Nicely paired with white beans. We shared two pasta dishes - Rigatoni and Spaghettini with grilled shrimp. Both were alright, but nothing to rave about, I liked the apps more. Rigatoni was better than the Spaghettini in that the texture was perfectly executed. Overall, pretty good experience.

We simply were walking ""home"" and decided a local Italian joint was our nightly calling.I wish I could provide a review of their more signature dishes but we were quite full with heavy food by this time. My salad was refreshing and hit the spot. My traveling companions enjoyed spaghetti and meatballs (they asked for a preparation off menu) and another salad. The ambiance was perfect with Harlem evening sitting outside the window like a good friend. The drinks were well prepared although I could have enjoyed a more engaging wine list.  The missing 5th star was hung up on delayed service. Our server seemed busy and not ignoring his patrons but tourists should not wait so long for their second drink!!!  He could have left each patron with the feeling they were welcomed and most important guest of the evening.

3.0,10/14/2016,"When people ask me what I like to do for fun, one of things that tops my list is Bottomless Brunch.  So when my sister who is really into brunch suggested this place, I was totally for it. I live in DC, and I believe it has spoiled me because I was a little underwhelmed. There are restaurants in DC that offer all you can eat delicious food and mimosas for $39! Or even less than that, depending on the place. I've gotten accustomed to leaving brunch spots in DC full and tipsy.Here's the scoop. Being familiar with the area, my sister suggested that we arrive as soon as Lido opened since we didn't make a reservation. At 10:45 on a rainy Sunday, we walked into the cute space to find about 5 tables and a few people at the bar. It was a perfect time to come since it wasn't full at all. After checking in the with the hostess, she informed us that she had a table we could have, but we'd need to vacate by 12:30 pm since it was reserved. Knowing that we had less than 2 allotted hours for bottomless mimosas put a little pressure on me to get my mimosas worth, but I think I handled it like a champ.Now about the menu. It's limited, in my opinion. And I have never seen so much hollandaise on one menu in my life! Not much on there was speaking to me, so I ended up ordering the Smoked Salmon Benedict. Yes, with hollandaise. It was served on two small English muffins, and a small side salad. Notice that I've used the word ""small"" twice. There's a reason for that. For $18, this was a very small serving. The meal itself was decent, definitely not anything to write home about. When it was over, I realized I was still hungry. I actually had to order a side dish of potatoes to get full. All in all, I think this particular entrée needs another side dish with it.As for the $16 mimosas, they were good and pretty strong. My glass was refilled and I never had to seek out my waiter, so kudos for that.  Will I come back? Maybe if I'm in the area again, but I can't say that I'll make a special trip.",2,1,1,Tiffy D.,"Washington, DC",61,104,165

5.0,9/17/2016,"Two years have passed since I last reviewed Lido, and it feels a bit taboo to do so because I regard the management and much of the staff as almost family, but the truth is the truth.  This continues to be one of the best restaurants in New York City, and it's just a happy accident that it is so near my house.I arrived early on a Friday night (5:30-6) to take advantage of the spacious and chill pre-rush atmosphere.  I almost always sit and the bar where Shine, the bartender, lights up the room with her shining smile, but I had an old friend with me tonight who rarely visits the City and was committed to make every meal as impeccable as it could possibly be.  I considered Lido to be a reliable choice for such a challenge, and my confidence was well-placed.  They exceeded my and my companion's rather lofty expectations once again.First, an easy thirst quencher is the red sangria, which I playfully refer to as ""wine kool aid,"" but it is actually a well-considered complex blend of flavors which is as satisfying to drink at the beginning of the meal as at the end.  The sangria is truly one of the unique charms at Lido.We choose an off-menu grilled octopus appetizer (another benefit of early dining) and the salt-Cod fritters for the first plates.  My companion cautioned that a family member's salt Cod preparation was so far the only known palatable one in existence.  After Lido's was sampled, my companion conceded there are now two, and this might be the better one.  The octopus was perfectly grilled, sauced sweetly, and served over savory beans.  Typically, in my experience, only Japanese restaurants are as careful and attentive to this dish.Our second course, shared family style, was the halibut over lemon risotto, the warm kale salad with cannellini, and the veal meatballs sauced with marinara, served in a hot iron skillet on a wooden plank  Each was perfectly prepared and presented.I generally find Halibut to be a rather uninteresting fish that has to be sauced heavily in order to be interesting.  Lido's preparation just brings out the subtle nature of the fish flavor, just presenting it, not overwhelming it or in anyway modifying it.  It is still only halibut, but it's just so much more interesting with this prep over lemon risotto.I freaking hate kale.  I think it is a scourge, a fraud, used far too much when and often spinach is a better choice,  Death to kale!.....except when I eat it at Lido.  Oh. My. God.  I not only find it palatable, I can't stop eating it.  I start to break out into urges to go through yoga asanas and light some candles.  It is the best thing, I don't care anymore, if loving kale is wrong, I don't wanna be right.  This is warn kale, charred, with cannellini beans and a subtle sherry vinaigrette.   It's kale for kale-haters.There are few fair even apples-to-apples comparisons one can make in dining reviews between restaurants:  sourdough bread, roasted chicken, french onion gratinee, and meatballs in tomato sauce.  Lido's veal meatballs in marinara seriously challenge most of the best places I've eaten in Northern Italy.  They not only do it right, they do it over and over and over again.  They can reproduce their excellence consistently in this classically simple dish.  I've been eating these for four years and I never tire of them.  This kind of consistent excellence is what distinguishes a good trendy restaurant from an institution.  Lido is an institution.For dessert, of course, Tiramisu, which is my favorite in the City.  Espresso from the bar.  The perfect combination to wrap up a great meal.I admit, i feel a bit like I'm telling some good guy what a cool person my sister is, I am at home at Lido.  I freely confess my emotional attachment and bias.But good is good, right is right.  Bias or no.  Lido is a really, really good restaurant that is worth travelling from a distance to experience.  It works, they know what they're doing, they care about persistent, reliable excellence.  Go.",0,0,0,Richard D.,"New York, NY",55,55,0

5.0,9/9/2016,"This was our 2nd time at Lido. We liked it so much the first time we decided to bring my mother-in-law with us for another go!We started with the Creamy Garlic Parmesan Bread Crostini and the Warm Arugula Salad. The garlic white sauce that sits in-between the bread and cheese on the crostini is really the star of the dish. The salad was also delicious, with the white balsamic vinaigrette really standing out against the walnuts and shaved parmesan.For our main course, we each had different dishes. My mother-in-law had the incredible Spaghetti with Veal Meatballs, San Marzanos, Basil, and Parmesan (which I had the first time we went to Lido - gotta admit, I was eyeing her plate the *whole time*). My wife had the Spinach Ricotta Tortellini (get a bite of the tortellini, with a little bit of ricotta, some of the cream sauce, and a few of the baby peas for *maximum effect*). I had the Halibut with Lemon Risotto, with perfectly-cooked fish and a really well-balanced lemon flavor in the risotto.The best way I can describe the food at Lido is via a quote from the chef-instructors at one of our cooking classes: ""When building a dish, you need to strive to have a variety of flavors and textures so that every bit is different, and your mouth stays interested for the entire meal.""And last, but not least, our server Rachael was awesome. She was friendly, attentive, and even invited us to an off-broadway show she's creative director for after noticing the Van Gogh artwork on our credit card! Super super cool.

Between the four of us dining we had many plates - starters, salads, pasta, poultry, etc., and every dish was as good as the next. I personally shared two salads to start - the Warm Arugula Salad and the Nectarine and Heirloom Tomato. Both were great, but the Nectarine and Heirloom tomato was simply delicious - what a great combination of bright and fresh flavors.For my main course I enjoyed the Gnocchi, and it was everything I wanted it to be without being too heavy to finish it off.

1.0,7/11/2016,"Writing a yelp review since I was unable to confirm if an email I attempted to send the restaurant via their website actually went through.  Yesterday morning I dined at Lido and while my meal and service at the bar were just fine, the behavior of two other staff members during my meal was utterly appalling, racially insensitive, disrespectful, and just plain WRONG.  On at least 3 occasions, I witnessed a white male server and a hispanic male server joking about the current police shootings of unarmed black men.  In between serving tables, whenever the two would pass each other, the white staff member would raise his hands and say ""WHITE POWER"", followed by the hispanic guy holding his hands up and saying ""HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT"".  Laughter ensued between the two after this.  It was funny to them.  To make matters worse, this occurred in a restaurant literally days after the world watched two unarmed black men murdered in cold blood on video all within 24 hours of each other.  These staff members think what is going on in this country is so comedic, that they felt comfortable displaying this behavior in public, at their place of employment, in full view and earshot of patrons such as myself.  As a black woman, and a resident of Harlem (a historically black neighborhood, which is changing due to gentrification, yet still very rich in black culture) for many years, I am extremely offended and still disturbed a day later that this happened in Harlem! When you work for any establishment whether it be the service industry or not, there is a certain level of decorum you exhibit and a code of conduct you follow because ultimately, you represent your employer.  I respect the views and opinions of any and everyone, if you think Black Lives Matter and the phrase ""hands up don't shoot"" is comedic, that's on you. But when you throw this in my face at a restaurant, a restaurant I'm spending my money which ultimately pays your wages, that's where we have a problem.  These men openly did this behavior at least 3 times.  Even after I made eye contact with one of them that nonverbally conveyed ""hey, I see you"".  I left Lido quite shaken up about what I had just witnessed.  On the way out, I recounted what I'd seen to the manager and while she seemed just as shocked as me, she simply said she would deal with it.  I'm not sure exactly what that means but I certainly hope it wasn't just a conversation had. We live in a day and age where more and more people are being held accountable for the insensitive or inappropriate language they use either verbally or via social media. Unless it's representative of the values of this company/establishment, employees behaving like this is unfortunately reflective of the company as a whole.  If these men are still employed with Lido after what they did yesterday, that let's me know where Lido stands on these issues and it sends the message that what they did was no big deal.  Obviously I'll never dine at Lido again.  I have already alerted other friends of mine in the neighborhood, both black and white, to follow suit and plan to cast a wider net in the event these men are still serving tables.  Any place where a white man feels comfortable saying ""white power""  is no place for black people to patronize and spend their hard earned money.  Doesn't matter if it's a joke or not.  It's not funny!  EVER. White power is hate speech.  Period.  Unless you like your entree with a side of racial insensitivity, please dine at one of the many other options available along Frederick Douglas Blvd.",6,0,1,Brittany D.,"New York, NY",0,28,2

1.0,6/28/2016,"""Methinks not"". Too right. What a shame. Came in for a late lunch on a random Monday and seeing as though it was less then half full I automatically assumed service and food would be fine. Granted, I was less than wowed the last time I came but I owed the host's rude behavior to a full house. I should have listened to my gut but I didn't and here goes. Menu arrived and I ordered. Glass of wine and mussels. Yum, right? The wine was fine. Three mussels in, I bit into a morsel full of sand. Now, I've eaten mussels my entire life and I know that one, they can be tricky to clean and two, they're from the ocean (dur) so a bit of grit once in a while is not unusual. So I brushed it off, washed it down with a sip and kept going. Another fork-full of sand. Not again. Then another. Now, I'm upset but figure it can't be that the entire plate is full of mussels laden with sand. It can't be that a restaurant full of people happily munching could have not washed their seafood before cooking and serving. After a fourth attempt, I can't go any further. I call the waitress over, who by the way, has not checked on me once. I quietly tell her that the mussels are sandy. She apologizes, asks if there's anything else I'd like (to which I say I'll look at a menu) and takes the plate away. As she passes who I assume is the manager, I hear her repeat my complaint followed by ""I've never heard anyone say that about the mussels before."" Excuse me?! What does your memory of costumer critique have to do with my plate of inedible food? The bill comes (?) After another ten minutes she returns for the bill which is complete, sans menu.I hold my card up as she reaches for it and explain that I was very disappointed with the meal and that I'm not at all concerned with what she's heard from other costumers about the meal at which point she cuts me off, says she'll see what she can do, grabs the bill and walks off. Two minutes later, a new bill arrives, minus the cost of the mussels and she explains that because she can't take anything off the bill, the mussels are on her. Pity.Lessons learned 1) Trust your instinct. 2) Don't give average restaurants second chances. 3)Once terrible service, always terrible service 4) Lido doesn't particularly care about it's wait staff if it forces them absorb the cost for their subpar food.Sad. Don't go. Plenty of better options in Harlem.",3,1,1,Robin H.,"New York, NY",5,7,0

4.0,5/1/2016,"Wow.Let's first talk about the neighborhood, this area is THE definition of gentrification. I am baffled at how awesome this area has become. With that said, Lido has to be one of the additions that defines this neighborhood. Classy, simple, great food, great crowd, great atmosphere all in the heart of Harlem. Let's discuss the food shall we? I started off with a kale salad which I thought sounded boring and when I first saw looked truly boring and small but don't let this fool you, this is a delicious action-packed tiny kale salad that you should try. Simple, filled with flavor and a great way to open up your appetite. Next, my boyfriend ordered the veal meatballs which I tried despite being a vegetarian and I have to say are delicious as ever. I've always said that no one tops Uva's veal meatballs but his place gives them some competition. They are served in a little pot and smothered in a delicious red sauce. All you need is some bread and you're set my friend. For my main course, I ordered the red snapper which was cooked perfectly and served over a bed of califlower, raisins, pine nuts and olives. To be quite honest I could have the bedding alone and be satisfied with my entire meal. Perhaps next time I'll do that. Hm. The olives are a bit too strong flavored though as I normally like green olives but it doesn't really matter this bedding is delicious as ever. A must try! Finally, my boyfriend ordered the mussels which were served with a curry like sauce and WA out of this world. I love mussles but am turned away at times because of the graininess it bring. These however, were clean as can be and prepared in a delicious sauce. Lido is a wonderful new addition to the area.

4.0,1/30/2016,"Late Restaurant Week Winter 2016 review for January 20. Came here with my friend for restaurant week. I had Lido bookmarked for a few months, and finally able to try their food. I made an early reservation at 5:30pm, and naturally, when I arrived, the place was empty. No complaints there. I figured the restaurant would start filling up after 7. Inside, it's a cute little restaurant. Comfortable seats, good lighting, nice bar setup. Restaurant week menu seemed good, which was another reason why I decided to make Lido my 1st stop for Restaurant Week. We started off with 2 glasses of Pinot Noir. The red wine was light, fruity, and smooth. Very nice. For apps, I had the Roasted Pumpkin & Apple soup, and my friend had the Crostino that was served with burrata. For entrees, I paid the $6 supplement for the Grilled Salmon filet, cooked medium. She had the Roasted Duck Risotto. And for dessert, I had the bread pudding and she had the Bittersweet chocolate brownie w/ vanilla gelato.I wasn't impressed with both my apps and my dessert. My pumpkin soup was way too peppery, and watered down. My friend's burrata crostino though, was delicious and flavorful! I tried a spoonful of my friend's Duck risotto and it was good. Creamy risotto, w/ bits of duck in it. Not bad. My salmon entree was cooked perfectly. Flaky, moist, fresh ingredients and perfectly seasoned! And for dessert, I thought my bread pudding w/ some kinda dried fruit that I still can't identify and a scoop of ice cream seemed rather busy and a poor combination of flavors. My friend's chocolate brownie dessert was impressive though. Overall, despite the underwhelming apps and dessert, I would still rate my restaurant week experience at Lido as 4 stars because of the attentive service and the quality and execution of my salmon entree. I will definitely be back to try their brunch food someday..from their pictures, brunch looks pretty legit.",5,2,3,Yu Z.,"Norfolk, VA",256,457,1321

4.0,1/19/2016,I came here on a lovely Saturday morning with my best buddy after a walk around Morningside Heights. Lido has a very cozy and intimate feel and environment. Good atmosphere all around and excellent service.I would highly reccomend getting the Baked French Toast. They use brioche so the bread absorbs all the eggy goodness without risk of getting too soggy. It comes with a healthy dallop of homemade whip cream and berries on the sides. It was scrumptious! And super affordable compared to the cost of a brunch platter in other parts of the city.,0,0,0,Laura Y.,"Mountain View, CA",11,109,39

Now, onto the food.  We ordered the cod fish fritters which were absolutely delicious.  They were perfectly seasoned.  i honestly probably could have eaten about 50.  There is nothing i hate more in a restaurant than having to pick up a salt shaker due to lack of seasoning, and this place definitely didn't have me grabbing the salt or pepper shaker. We also ordered the Parmesan  polenta fries, very good too.  For my entree i got the salmon with celery root mashed and crispy parsnip ribbons, everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly like our appetizers, i also really appreciated the fact that my salmon was cooked medium like i asked.  My husband ordered the organic crispy chicken with the arugula and garlic mashed potatoes.  its was phenomenal, literally probably the best mashed potatoes i have ever had.  My only complaint would be that the chicken was kind of a small portion.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate pudding with sea salt and EVOO, it was decadent and rich, and the salt gave it just the saltiness the pudding needed to balance it out. I can't emphasize how much i loved this place and honestly cannot believe it has received anything less than 5 stars.  If this restaurant was closer to me i would definitely be here every week. totally recommend, totally worth the drive.",0,0,0,Samantha H.,"Mount Kisco, NY",6,37,20

I must say though, it gets pretty crowded in here and if you're not good with crowd it may not be the best spot for you. The waiting time is also long especially if you didn't make a reservation. It gets busy and noisy and sometimes you can't hear yourself think. But the food is so worth it which is why my boyfriend and I keep coming back and have even invited some friends over for brunch. We've only had dinner here once and I wasn't impressed.

The service was also impeccable even though it was so crowded. Our waiter was extremely attentive throughout our meal, kept coming by with refills for our mimosas and water, and was really friendly. We definitely got a great deal with the mimosas because he topped up our glasses so frequently our glasses never went empty! Very impressive service!As for the food, a few of my friends got the Polenta ($15) which looked and smelt amazing and tasted delish! I really regretted not getting that too because I was underwhelmed by the dish I ordered (Tuscan Pizza Tart, $13), which was pretty much just a small pita-pizza that you could easily make at home. To give them some credit, the dish was meant to be an appetizer and the waiter had actually advised me to order something else. I was just too stubborn and just HAD to satisfy my pizza craving right there and then.. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Lido for a great boozy brunch experience. I can't wait to go back and already know what I'm gonna order next time!

It's crowded and noisy and you need a reservation, but it's worth it, especially considering the lack of other brunch options in the immediate area.Dinner Lido is your average upscale Italian restaurant. What I call ""classy"" portions, which is to say, not huge, but enough to fill you up. I had the scallops and risotto, which was perfectly fine, but not the best I've ever had. I wasn't a huge fan of the risotto (topped with watercress, I think, which I wasn't a fan of, and otherwise the flavor was uninspired), but the scallops were nice - five well-seared, medium size scallops, which is actually more generous than a lot of places. We started with the polenta fries, which were alright, but again nothing special, and I had their specialty gin cocktail, which was heavy on the limoncello. The ambiance at dinner is a little weird - they have a screen showing a football game on over the bar, but otherwise it's not really that kind of a place, so it threw me off a bit.On the bright side, we were running late for our dinner reservation (8pm on a Saturday) and they pushed it back a bit for us with no problem.

FILM AT ELEVEN.I chose Lido to celebrate my birthday mainly because it advertised bottomless mimosas, plus the incredible sounding menu made it all the more appealing. I placed the reservation well in advance for 16 people. The hostess made it very clear to me that my party would not be seated if we were not all present AND if 2 or more people were no shows I would be charged $20 per person. When sending out the invitations to my friends and family I stressed both of these points urging them to please be on time. The day before the brunch the restaurant called me to confirm the reservation. At the time of the call, the group had dropped from 16 to 15.  The next day we were there not only on time but we were early! However we were made to wait for 20 minutes. That was strike 1. After making such a big deal of letting me know I needed to be there at noon because ""we're soooo busy blah blah blah and those are tables we could use blah blah blah!"", I expected to be seated on time. Here comes strike 2: When we were finally being seated, it turned out we were actually now a group of 17 instead of 15. Well I guess those 2 extra bodies made the hostess's brain explode because she couldn't accommodate us. Or rather she WOULD NOT accommodate us. She was very clear that she could not make any room and therefore my friends could not be seated. So they left and took their business across the street to Harlem Tavern and missed being a part of my birthday celebration. In retrospect we should have gone with them. By the way, did I mention it was my birthday and this hostess ALMOST ruined it for me? She made zero attempt to accommodate us even though there was a two top right in front of our table that would have been perfect for, oh I don't know, TWO PEOPLE?! She claimed it was already reserved. We were just about done with our meal before that reservation showed up. She could have seated my friends at that table but refused. There are so many cute spots in that immediate area that I could have chosen. Harlem Tavern, The Park 112, 5 and Diamond all come to mind but I chose Lido. I regret it.  Rant over.The only saving grace was the food and our waiter Aaron. The food was indeed delicious! Everybody was very happy with their entrees. Aaron made sure that no one's glass was ever empty. He had a good attitude and did his best to make sure we were having a good time which is more than I can say for the hostess who did not check in with us once!

I perfer the orange sangria, they seem to put all the right, fresh ingredients but there is one or two other subtle tastes I cannot put my finger on that makes this drink sensational!I've only come for dinner.  The portions are not the most generous, but the flavor of the pasta and secondi items knock my socks off.

I was a bit worried we would be rushed out due to the time limit, but our waitress allowed us to sit and converse for quite a while even after we were done with our meals. We ordered our food and it surprisingly came out not even 20 minutes later. I ordered the Omelet with Mushroom, Bacon, Caramelized Onion, Goat Cheese and my friend ordered the Baked French Toast, Berries, Cream, & Maple Syrup. We both shared a Side of Potatoes with Vidalia Onions, and Rosemary. My food was honestly just ""meh""..and there was no salt or ground pepper on the table to add a little seasoning to my plate. The bacon was soggy/mushy and there wasn't enough goat cheese. My friend enjoyed her food, so I may have to try that next time. The potatoes could have used a little more seasoning as well, but they weren't bad. FYI - there are only two separate bathrooms for restaurant goers to use.

2.0,8/14/2015,"POOR MANAGEMENTThe hostess/manager at the front is very welcoming. The server did not arrive for more than 15 minutes, and he was to-the-point and brash. My husband ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu and I ordered from the regular menu.The Restaurant Week menu is varied and carries many items are from their usual menu. However, the portions are way too small, and leave you hungry.We had the tomato and mozzarella salad to start. Food runners simply auction off and drop the food. There is no offer of cheese or pepper, even Olive Garden does that. We had the crab and lobster ravioli (Restaurant Week portion) and I had the grilled salmon. Both plates were delicious, but my $24 salmon was less than a 3 oz portion. I was still hungry after finishing it.At the end of our meal, we watched a server run by with a salmon plate. It was clearly more than double my portion. I spoke with a woman, who said she was the manager. I asked her why that salmon dish looked so different than mine. She told me that was the ""regular portion"", not ""restaurant week portion"". I told her that I had also ordered the regular one, and I received one that was half of the size. She told me that I should have informed her earlier and it was too late now. How is a customer supposed to know this if  it's their first time here?! She and the hostess apologized, but no offers were made to resolve their error. I paid full price for a half portion; we left the restaurant unhappy and still hungry.I went home, and had a bowl of milk and cereal. The food is great, but the management is very poor.

Each person in our party of 4 chose a different breakfast entree and no one was left unsatisfied. The short rib hash with poached eggs was out of this world as were the respective omelettes my friends ordered. Another stand out dish was the polenta with poached egg, I've never had polenta as well prepared nor an egg so well poached. Another great add on for brunch that a lot of restaurants will offer is unlimited mimosas, which Lido offers for an additional $15 with a 2 hour time limit. Unlike some other brunch locations, Lido is really good about making sure that your mimosa glass is never empty and they don't try and rush you out as soon as you've finished your food.

Like that it's not pretentious (some drunch places are full of the worst people in New York), like the nice restaurant itself, and man do they keep the drinks flowing!Why it's not 5 stars: 1) Portions are way too small. Sure the food is good, but if everyone is starving at the end of the meal - not sure the quality is good enough to compensate for the quality. 2) The food is ok, I've had better for less. I had the White Polenta, Truffle Oil, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Poached Eggs (whew!). I""m obsessed with polenta + eggs + ragu, but I've had it other places for less (Carroll Place!!!) I'd go for a sweet entree next time, the savory ones all looked a little lacking. 3) Too expensive! $15 on top of an entree cost of already $15 for unlimited drinks is too much. I'm not going to pay $30 for drunch if I'm only getting mimosas, at least through in some interesting sangrias (looking at you Calle Ocho). All in all, it was pretty good but not worth the price.

4.0,7/23/2015,"*Closer to 3.5 Stars*I'm a fan! I've been here twice and had great food both times. The chicken milanese and spaghetti with meatballs are both very good. The garlic mash that's served with the chicken is mind-blowing. I've tried and also liked the caesar salad, the polenta fries, and the cod fritters, though I think prices across the board are a little inflated, especially for the not-huge portion sizes (particularly for the polenta fries and fritters). The chocolate budino is a dark chocolate mousse-like dish drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt. I was a little nervous to try it, but have been dreaming about it since. Rich, savory, and surprising-what more could you ask for? Pro Tip: Try the white sangria with passion fruit. Amazing. Service is good, but on my first visit, I witnessed something I personally find unacceptable. While walking into the restaurant, I saw a bus boy standing outside the spot and catcalling a passerby. Street harassment is never welcome, never okay,  and honestly it's so unprofessional to see someone doing that when they are supposed to be acting as a representative of the business. Just gross.

Yeah well, that's probably more about how drunk they were when they ate the food than the actual food. Maybe Lido is great at Italian fare, but a good brunch spot it is not. Honestly, if you mess up an omelette bad enough that although the customer is mildly buzzed they can still tell thats a sad omelette, then Houston we have a problem. Let me back up, we made a reservation and sat down, got the bottomless mimosas and got going. We noticed the mimosas tasted a bit watery but they were good enough so we weren't too discouraged. Then our food came. I got the pesto omelette with turkey sausages and my boyfriend got the pancakes. In their defense, he said the pancakes were ok. My omelette was another story. You know when you put egg in to oil thats not hot enough so it get kind of dark? Rookie mistake right? So I had a dark oily omelette, I understand they tried to do pesto in the omelette and that could've made it oily but no, just no. Plus some Superrr under seasoned turkey patty things..it was a sad meal. By the time we left we had headaches, I have a high tolerance and was barely tipsy so it didn't even occur to me it was an alcohol headache till my boyfriend mentioned he had a headache too later in the day.

They won't give you the promotion. For the most part; this place is a cute little trendy spot. The worst part is that the tables are so close together that you are literally involved in someone else's conversation. But you can't beat that $15 mimosa deal (for 2 hours from the start of your 1st mimosa) and their affordable brunch. Wish I took images of my food! They have some good vegetarian options - or you could have them make it vegetarian for you. I mention because aduh! I'm a veggie lover. Make sure to make a reservation thru open table tho.

3.0,5/2/2015,Finally went to Lido for brunch and overall found it to be ok. The unlimited mimosas are $15/person and we tried both the baked French toast and the short rib hash Benedict. The French toast while soft on the outside was a little harder than I would like on the outside and the short rib hash (which I think only had like 3 small potatoes) was ok-not bland but not as flavorful as I would have hoped. The waiter was nice and attentive making sure that our glasses were continuously full. I think I would go back and try something different next time since it's not too far and the service was good.,0,0,0,Shiny M.,"New York, NY",10,30,12
5.0,4/29/2015,"I am so grateful for Lido. I live in Morningside Heights, where all of the restaurant options are painfully mediocre. Lido is just across the park and quickly became my favorite spot for any occasion: Saturday night, Sunday brunch, quick weekday lunch! My husband orders the Spaghettini Arrabiata every time we go and I don't blame him -- it's consistently delicious. I loooove the grilled kale salad, the mussels, or the Spaghetti with Roasted Veal Meatballs. The service is always friendly and on point!

I realize there are many other wonderful reviews of Lido. Most are about brunch and the bottomless mimosa deal... Which sounds fun. Some people like a place based on a good deal. Personally, I would rather pay for my drinks and be treated with the basic level of respect one would show a stranger. There are some good reviews about the food as well,  but we didn't even get to try the food. The host? Owner? Manager? lady was just so unbelievably condescending and rude.

However, I appreciated the attentiveness of our waiter (Aaron I think his name was) in filling up our glasses with their delicious mimosa.

Terrific service and staff along with a diverse and mixed kind of crowd the night we were here. Looks like a nice spot to take a date or even do brunch at. Heck - a bottomless mimosa brunch is always a good thing! Roasted pumpkin and apple soup, braised short ribs, and hazelnut gelato with salted shortbread cookie were all delicious.

I typically ordered the asparagus and shrimp omelette and it hit the spot every time. I'd recommend making a reservation on the weekend if it's more than 2 people because it gets crowded.

I have had take out on  multiple occasions and have also dined in. My last dine in experience was yesterday with some of my colleagues and twice the server had to take back one of my colleagues glass because there was something in it (he ordered a ginger ale that you pour in the glass yourself, so it seemed like a lack of paying attention on the staffs part). After the second time it stirred up a story time between my group and they let me know that someone else in our office had ordered take out and there was a piece of rust in his food :(. As disturbing as this may sound to readers we still ate there (yikes, right?) lol but the food was delicious and there were no more mistakes made (visible ones anyhow). Whoever works the kitchen please be more careful and sanitary, it would be much appreciated and keep the review of this place up.A huge plus for this place is it is nice and bright and not on the rowdy side so you can enjoy a nice conversation and even catch up on some work which I have seen some people do in the back of the restaurant.",0,0,0,Shakira W.,"Brooklyn, NY",140,228,270

Still trying to remember which ha! The shrimp omelet with fontina (I don't like goat cheese) was super tasty.

The environment of the restaurant is just my speed. It's quaint, clean, has a great seating and an overall cool vibe. It's very pretty and is a place you could definitely sit for a drink and chat for hours!I ordered the brussel sprouts which weren't the greatest. They were a little bitter and tasted mildly of vinegar. Also enough of the bacon fat was not kept in the dish so the bacon was flavorless and did not compliment brussel sprouts as it usually does. Although I did get them without ricotta, I don't think it would have impacted the taste much.The Salt Cod Fritters were really good. Its like a less fishy version of a crab cake in bite sized portions! Loved them and the sauce was great. Now lets discuss the CHOCOLATE BUNDINO! That is what turned everything around, food wise! I dream of that little chocolate, olive oil, and sea salt dessert. It was great. The bartender recommended the last two items which did not disappoint.

I'm talkin' black and blue meat kind of guy and for the first time, maybe in my entire life, I went without. I ordered the polenta. Something which was absolutely shocking in my own eyes but it was calling my name. I was pleasantly surprised. Amazing grub. My girlfriend ordered the spaghetti, and was very happy she did so.

The wine list is short but complete, and is reasonably priced. We had a great bottle of Primitivo and then another. Excellent value and it was made better by the smell of truffle oil which seemed to permeate the place. The appetizers were all good. The crostini is very tasty and was the standout. The salads are well put together but not exceptional. We had three kinds of pasta and they were all excellent, beautifully cooked and large portions. I think the best of them was the lasagna, made in a small skillet with veal, beef and pork layers. It was mostly meat and sauce with a little pasta in between. The highlight was the duck risotto.

Last night, I actually had forgotten to make reservations (highly recommend that you do) - but, I called and spoke w/ Genevieve @ 6:30 for an 8 PM table for 7:30.  Totally accommodating & told me that she had a small table in the back area by the bar - not the best - but she could do pull 2 together.  Perfectly fine. The mussels were as tasty as always; arrabiata with shrimp is great. Wine selection is very good and reasonably priced.  Butternut Tortellini very nice.  Appetizer's - crab cake is stong; the Broccoli Rabe - pass.

1.0,11/25/2014,"I was hoping for much, much better. We ate dinner here in October. The food was boring at best and too expensive for what it was.  I had the tortellini which was  almost inedible - too salty with a thick, gooey sauce.  I had to stop after a few bites.  Despite the fact that I hardly ate any of my meal, the waitress never asked about why that might be.  Nor did she seem particularly concerned about the rest of the table.So - mediocre to poor quality food and disinterested service.  We will not be going here again.",1,0,0,Chris H.,"Portland, OR",0,19,0
3.0,11/25/2014,"This place is beautiful. Very nice chic look, must look even better in the summer with the doors open. But the service wasn't so great. Our waiter's name was Attila. We found him very cold, no personality which I think is necessary for a waiter. While we were still eating our appetizers, he came over to ask us for our next meal. We felt rushed instead of relaxed, given that it seemed to be a very relaxing environment. We asked for a little more time, so we could finish our appetizer and then decide what we wanted for the entree and drinks. He came back a little later, we gave him our order, which was the NY Strip steak. We noticed that he didn't ask how we wanted them cooked, which is a basic question when someone orders steak. So before he walked away, my husband stopped him so that he could tell him how we wanted our steaks cooked. My husband also needed a few more minutes to decide on what drink he wanted since there drink menu is very extensive. He never actually came back to get that order so my husband never got a drink.There were 3 different bus boys who took good care of us, making sure we had water and removing our used plates from the table and also bringing our food over. We felt we had better service from them than the actual waiter who took our orders. He only kept coming over to see if we were done, instead of asking if we needed anything else, which again, made us feel rushed, He didn't ask if we wanted another drink or if we wanted desert. By the time we finished our meal, we wanted to leave. So when we asked for the check, he had it ready already, which again says that he was ready to rush us out. BTW, the place was 2/3 empty. No where near busy or packed. It was a Monday night. He pretty much stood around the whole time we were there, just looking around.For appetizer, my husband and I shared the roasted plum tomatoes option w/mozzarella and basil pesto on grilled bread. It was very delicious. It was honestly the best part of the meal. For entree, we had the NY strip steak which had good presentation. It looked great, but the steak had too much fat and cartilage that I had to cut out. It also was a little burnt so the taste of the steak was mixed with a black burnt taste. The garlic and parsley sauce was good and also the golden fries with butter.But the main course, the steak, was my least favorite out of everything I had.If I ever come back here, it would be for an actual Italian meal, maybe a pasta. And hopefully I will have a better waiter. If it wasn't for him, I would've given 4 stars.",1,1,1,Lyanne S.,"New York, NY",0,19,22

We quickly got into the mussels and polenta fries which were both awesome!  There were so many mussels it could easily be an entree for one.  However, we happily ate our hearts out and slurped up the broth barely leaving a drop. By then we were feeling good and a little too overdone to be ordering full entrees.  We opted for the arugula salad, the grilled kale salad with shrimp, and the spinach tortellini.  All three dishes had great flavor and decent portions.  We couldn't finish it all and had to take the kale salad and pasta home.  Lucky for me, I get to have another taste of yumminess again tomorrow.  I will happily head back next time we are looking for fresh, quality food in a nice trendy atmosphere.",0,0,0,Michelle M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,12,5

3.0,11/1/2014,"I wish I could give Lido more than 3 stars, but my boyfriend and I were both pretty disappointed in our last experience eating there. We live a few blocks away and both work from home, so we always look for places in the area that are open for lunch during the week (not so many options available). Lido was sometimes our choice for lunch since they have the $10 lunch menu that had pretty decent options. To our surprise, when we went there for lunch yesterday, we found out that they have removed two of the best items from the $10 lunch menu  - the burguer and the pasta option. Now the special lunch menu is so boring. I ended up ordering the spaghetti with tomato sauce, which I thought was very expensive for a simple pasta dish in a lunch menu ($17). I wouldn't mind paying that price if I were served a nice dish, however the noodles were very overcooked and the sauce was nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the egg panini and was not impressed.I do have to say that I really like the decor and ambiance at Lido, and I did have a good experience there before over brunch. But as an Italian restaurant, based on my experience, they do have to make improvements to their pasta dishes. At least please don't serve overcooked noodles!",1,0,0,Urban D.,"Manhattan, NY",36,61,3

2.0,10/11/2014,"CONS: I was so disappointed in all our entrees and they weren't cheap, so that was a bummer. Gnocchi was gummy. Steak was overcooked and under seasoned. Fries were soggy and aioli was dull. Spaghetti arrabbiata was a bad joke. Lobster ravioli had a weird undercooked texture and practically no flavor besides being blandly creamy. PROS: Service was good. Vibe is nice-it's loud and energetic but cozy enough that you can still hear your dinner companions easily. Cocktails we got (tequila with lime and Sriracha) were good. Mussels app was really yummy and the tapenade they serve with bread at every table is garlicky and delicious. Conclusion: go for drinks and apps but skip dinner.

4.0,10/6/2014,"Sunday brunchday...I honestly love a good brunch and when I saw this on Yelp, the first thing I had to say was... I gotta go.  Unfortunately, didn't go for the bottomless mimosas, but I gotta say- it's something you have to try.Either way, it looks absolutely chic and fabulous on the outside.  Like many restaurants in the area, it has outdoor seating in warmer weather.  However, it looks so much like a SoHo brunch place, with its tan leather booths and elegant bar.  Even the name sounds nice, ""Lido"".  We waited about 20 minutes for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and it was totally worth the wait.  We ordered the toast with the homemade jam.  The toast is not like your regular white toast, it is crunchy in every bite and just absolutely perfect.  As for the raspberry jam, it is absolutely delicious as well.  Very watery for a jam, but nonetheless made with real fruit- the way jam should always be made.My boyfriend ordered the poached eggs and rib eye on an English muffin and boy, was it good.  The rib eye was seasoned extremely well and the poached eggs.. let's just say they know how to poach their eggs.  Even the salad on the side was delicious- very nice dressing and addition of cranberries.  I ordered the poached eggs on sauteed spinach and potatoes.  I'm not much of a potato person, but I was feelin' potatoes and boy, they gave me some seasoned potatoes.  Couldn't argue much about the spinach either... so perfect.  Both dishes are a fair price- under $15, I believe.It's a nice place, very cozy and comfy with good food.  I would totally stay here for the mimosas and even more breakfast/brunch food.  The only reason I took a star off was because the service wasn't the best.  I didn't feel like my waitress was extremely attentive, but I understand in that it is a busy place.  I know the waiters work really hard to keep filling up glasses, but it's sometimes even hard to call them over.",4,0,1,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401

Rachael was our server and she was extremely professional, knew everything about the menu, and was overall just the picture of perfect service. In truth, I got the sense that all the staff--servers and bussers alike--take some pride in their work--a VERY RARE thing these days. But Rachael was just the bomb. Dinner a Lido was fine dining experience indeed, with no pretension.The asparagus/mushroom app which was sweet and delicious. Small portion. The mussel dish was nice and hearty due to the cannellini beans that made for a nice stew. Kale salad was substantial, too. This wasn't a flimsy dish of loosely tossed kale leaves. It was a dense pile of kale that could be shared with others. They didn't skimp on either of these.Outdoor seating is fantastic, though it was a little chilly for me tonight.

We didn't feel rushed at all, which was sooooo nice, especially in NYC.  Granted, it was a Wednesday night, so not too popping, but still, really pleasant to feel easy about being there.We shared one of the specials brussel sprouts with bacon which was really tasty.  I know anyone can make this dish, but the mix of sweet and salty was lovely.  I ordered the gluten free penne and roasted veal meatballs.  So simple yet sooo tasty.  The sauce had this really great tang and the meatballs were great.  A little crumbly, but still great.  My friend had the crab cakes which she enjoyed and my other friend ordered the arugula salad and pizette which she polished off.  We ordered the special dessert which was a pistachio/almond cake with chocolate ganache, homemade whipped cream and a lovely apricot sauce.  I usually HATE dry cake and this is drier in the tradition of this particular dish, BUT paired with the ganache and apricot it was awesome.When I've brunched here, I've had the braised short rib hash -whoa, so good!  My friend took half of it because he enjoyed it so much!  He had the omelette with bacon and mushroom which was great but definitely not as compelling as the short rib hash!  So great to have such a solid option in the neighborhood with awesome food and a nice atmosphere.",0,0,0,Gabriela F.,"Manhattan, NY",22,48,0

The small ones like sawdust.  Why Lido? And a small point, is that it didn't come with the usual toasted/seasoned/grilled bread for dipping, just some plain slices of Italian.

Brunch is very good as well.  The wine list is a very good selection from across Italy, done with some care, and quite reasonably priced.Staff are very efficient and quite warm for the most part (shout out to Atilla).  I will say, they're always busy, so try to be on time for your reservation.  We've taken our daughter here from the time she was an infant and they're always quite helpful and accommodating.  The mashed potatoes and tapenade are her favorites.The space is very nice, especially the tables close to the French doors if the weather's nice.  There are a few tables that are a bit of a tight squeeze in the center.  It can be a bit packed at times.",0,0,0,Subir G.,"New York, NY",9,64,0

5.0,8/2/2014,"I wanted to take my gf out for a celebratory dinner and chose to give this restaurant a try. In addition to being conveniently located, the menu for restaurant week looked pretty interesting.  Though the menu received at the restaurant was not quite the same as the one found online, in the end, I'm so happy we went!We both started with a cocktail.  I had the Floozie.  I'm not a big fan of gin, but I thought the rest of the ingredients sounded really good and decided to take a chance. Good thing I did.  The drink was great; it was exactly what I was hoping for.  It was crisp/light and somewhat fruity, and the gin was not at all overpowering.  For dinner, I had the warm arugula salad (with walnuts, pears and shaved parmesan), followed by the spaghetti with roasted veal meatballs.  To be quiet honest, the salad was a little disappointing.  The ingredients were nice and fresh.  However, both my gf and I agreed that it lacked a little acidity.  The dressing seemed to be mostly olive oil, which took away from each item, individually (at least for us).  However, this was in no way a disappointment.  Where the salad might've lacked, the entrée more than made up for.  My spaghetti was cooked perfectly.  The veal meatballs were tender, moist and well-seasoned, and the sauce was extremely flavorful.  Even the bread and the tapenade were delicious.For dessert, I opted for the hazelnut gelato with shortbread cookie.  I was a little hesitant when the waiter informed me that they'd run out of the hazelnut gelato and asked if I'd like mascarpone gelato, instead.  However, dinner was so good, my hesitance didn't last long and I decided to go for it.  I know what you're thinking.  Cheese gelato?!  It was one of the first thoughts that came to my mind as well, but trust me when I say it was the most amazing thing I'd ever tasted!  The gelato tasted something like whipped cream and the cookie was slightly sweet, flaky, and practically melted on my tongue.  Phenomenal! To make the night even better, service was incredible. The hostess who seated us was quick and nice.  Our waiter, Tom, was the sweetest guy and responded to our table in record time.  The staff in general seemed to be extremely organized and worked very well as a team.  Whether by our waiter or one of the servers, food and drink items arrived at our table promptly and the moment something was done, someone was there to refresh or take them away...and were extremely pleasant while doing so.  I was also very impressed by the manager, Douglas, who kept a smile on his face as he walked around, helped out, and introduced himself.  I couldn't help but to stop him to say job well done.  All in all, the experience at this restaurant was one for the record books.  They've gained a customer for life.  I've yet to stop raving about them and am even planning to return in a couple of weeks when an old friend comes to town.",0,0,0,Ana D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,135,0

I made a reservation at 2 PM today for 5 people and when we arrived a few minutes early they already had the table set up for us. Four out of the five of us opted to go with the bottomless mimosa option for $14 each & I was impressed with how adamant they were about keeping our glasses filled. (Even after we had paid the bill and were sitting there for a few minutes our waitress came over and asked if anyone wanted more!) Also all of the food was delicious. I got the French toast which was amazing and also tried some of the bacon and fried potatoes, all of which I found to be very tasty. The spaghetti and veal meatballs were also quite good - there is a little something extra in the sauce that makes it slightly spicy which I really enjoyed. All around this place did not fail to live up to the hype - would have gotten 5 stars from me if not for the wait between entrees coming out, although it didn't bother us too much since the place was busy.",1,0,0,JeanMarie C.,"Bogota, NJ",28,3,1

The second time I had the gnocchi which was also alright but I've had better at almost half the price. My friend had a lasagna which looked super mediocre and he claims he has had better frozen lasagna and rates it a 2/5.

We got there around 4 so the brunch was over...but my bf had only had their brunch before not their dinner menu.The menu was just horrible, it's one of those menu's you don't know what to get b/c everything has something in it that you cannot pronounce and you have no idea what it is and it doesn't even sound good. I had some pasta with lobster (can't remember the name of it) and he had spaghetti with shrimp and spicy red sauce. BOTH our meals were straight up TASTELESS. I had to put so much salt on my food and the service was very VERY subpar....Fast forward two weeks...GOODMy boyfriend and I got up early and came to brunch. Mimosa's were on point. I got a basic eggs bacon and potato meal which was very good. Potatoes were cooked perfectly and so were the eggs. our glasses were never empty as they came around quite often with the pitcher.

The radicchio, beet and orange salad was also a beautiful plate. Our son really enjoyed the arugula and burrata salad.They cook the salmon the way you like, hence fish is fresh. My wife asked for it rare and rare it came, with a balsamic glaze, over a bed of celeri-root purée. I had the pork chop which was perfectly cook and served with yummy crispy kale and crispy fingerling potatoes.As for service, we can not complain, on the contrary. Nice conversations with our waiter and floor manager. Noise level was acceptable even if it was jammed pack.",1,1,1,Joffrey B.,"Montreal, Canada",44,17,0

It was served in a piping hot miniature iron skillet which you dined straight out of (after it cooled down a bit). Very tasty, as was the salad greens which came with it and my 2 red sangrias just made everything perfect.  My wife had the salmon which she enjoyed.  She had the salmon the last time we were here.  Excellent service: water glass always filled without asking; drop a knife or fork, utensils replaced before you know it.

4.0,2/11/2014,"Bored of the usual Sunday morning breakfast / brunch haunts of mine (read: Upper West Side diners and the same ol' lovely but tried bakeries), I wanted to head in a new direction, literally. I've heard of many new restaurants popping up in the southern part of Harlem, so I let my Yelp app do the searching, and lo and behold, we were soon led to Lido.It's a simple hop off of the B / C at 116th, awfully convenient to get to. The interior is large, the crowd, varied, with a white breezy ambiance and small chandeliers twinkling above. Seated in the rear, the squeeze was a trifle tight in our winter coats, but doable. The food was the kind that made us stop mid-chew as the flavors and textures hit us in a tremendous wallop. I got the gnocchi with truffle butter, parmesan, guanciale, and sage. The cream sauce it's served in is almost criminally good. They should make you sign a waiver absolving them from wrong doing if you get a heart attack after consumption. You can really taste heavy cream notes with a perfect hint of truffle oil. If I had a spoon, I would have eaten it like soup afterwards.The guanciale was good for the most part, with a few chewy pieces here and there. The gnocchi itself was perfectly cooked and toothsome. The beau got the steak panini. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, and the Gorgonzola was a perfect compliment; not too pungent or overwhelming. The side serving of greens was bright and perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette.Oh, and the bottomless mimosa option for brunch? I'm on board!Come early on a Sunday if you're going the brunch route, or make a reservation....or wait across the street at Levain and pre-game with a cookie if you're put on a wait list.",2,0,0,Allison C.,"New York, NY",215,1638,450

5.0,12/16/2013,"I have to admit that I like the idea of brunch, but not always the execution of it. The attempt to provide both breakfast and lunch dishes, and get patrons in and out as quickly as possible often causes brunch to fall flat for me. The weekend brunch at Lido is the exception to this rule. The food is fresh, inspired, and flavorful. We ordered the French Toast, Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, Turkey Sausage, and Fried Potatoes. And of course, we had to try the crepe and plum gelati for dessert (as if French Toast with whipped cream and syrup isn't dessert enough). Obviously, I'm all about Sunday afternoon decadence!  Everything we tasted was amazing, but the sausage was a particular standout. It was almost the consistency of a crab cake with flavors of apple, lemon, and sage. Our server Chris was excellent. He was attentive, knowledgeable and fun! He took our orders right away, and checked in on us to see how our ""first bites"" were. Most importantly, regardless of how busy the restaurant got, he was always magically on hand to refill our champagne glasses. The mimosas were indeed bottomless!!The diverse and lively crowd at Lido is part of the experience; brunch is an excellent time for people watching. Furthermore, Lido is one of those rare places that is fabulous and kid friendly at the same time.

Like the kind of loud where you go through half the meal pretending you know what your dining partner is saying. But with unlimited mimosas, neither of us seemed to care what the other was saying and my baked eggs in cream were oozy and decadent.Pre-bar crawl dinner was strategic. Four little plates split amongst the two of us to leave room for the booze, and the your-still-doing-barcrawls-at-thirty sorrow. Polenta fries, crab cake and veal meatballs were substantial portions and all super tasty. Gnocchi was good but swimming in sauce- if you get this, make sure you got plenty of bread for mopping. Celebrity spotting: some chick from law and order. If you saw her, you'd know who I'm talking about...$10 lunch deal also impressed.

It was OK but not good enough for me to order my own. Instead I ordered a bread with tomatoes and fresh cheese. They only gave two pieces of this and I thought that was a bit stingy (-1 star). When sharing with a guest that is only 1 piece each and for the price, not worthwhile. In my opinion, should have been 4 pieces (2 per person or enough for 1 per person for a 4 person table).As an entree my date ordered the special, which was a full fish with potatoes and greens. It was good but a little boring. I felt like it needed a bit of a glaze of some sort. I ordered the pumpkin ravioli which was amazing.

5.0,10/20/2013,"My story with Lido started in a completely unbiased way. I believe those ones usually last forever. In fact, I am happy to make what it is a little trip for me as many times as I can to enjoy Lido's food.  On the months I was on an apartment hunting in the area, the aesthetics of Lido call my attention enough for us to get brunch right away. On a completely virgin state of mind, by the means of not even knowledge of Yelp rating, reviews, or any people's opinion whatsoever, I thought at the end how was even possible I never heard of a place like this. Decor and aesthetics however, are just appearance; in many occasions they may fail to deliver what really matters. Lido is a perfect place in the noncritical, but Lido also deliver on the Trinity of the five stars: wonderful food, wonderful service, pleasant ambiance, vibrant experiences. I know, I just told you more than a Trinity; maybe I should put down five, one for every star I am giving to them. But then I would have to think about more. Be aware of Lido's popularity. Many locals seems to have it as a brunch and dining destination. Me, and perhaps a few others, were like travelers that go back for the sake of a five stars. The approach is very simple: classic Italian dishes, clean flavors fresh ingredients. Try their salads, particularly the Sugar Snap Pea, Arugula, Mint, and Basil with torn Burrata. Also the Warm Salad of Arugula, Roasted Pears, Walnuts and Shaved Parmesan. We heard about the grilled kale salad, and would probably be my next. Impressed also for their Omelet with Mushroom, Guanciale, Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese and you can also make changes in your dish if you like. Without hesitation or complaints. Intrigued enough about Lido, I can tell you now I may didn't hear about it because my ears weren't open enough. Apparently, current Lido's chef is a James Beard Award Winner: Chef Serena Bass*. Google her. There is plenty of reasons for you to expect Lido to be a 5 stars. But you know what? even when an awarded chef provides a logical explanation, we also know how many proclaimed chefs fail in your expectations. She is been in charge for just a year, and apparently, the previous was as good as the former**.  I don't know about that, but in a sense, it corroborates the need for many aspects to make a solid 5 stars out of a place. If my experience at Lido is not perfect at some point, it would also be fine with me. I really, really like this place and for me Lido is perfect in many ways. Including just for the record, Lido's location across the street Levain bakery.

4.0,10/16/2013,"One of my favorite brunch spots in the neighborhood.  Very solid food (love that several of the poached egg dishes are served in mini skillets).  Bottomless mimosas, lovely outdoor seating, reasonable prices.  What else could you ask for?I've been to Lido twice - the first time with my best friend who was visiting for the weekend, and the second time with a loud boisterous group of nine.  The wait staff is great, though at times inconsistent (might be a matter of overlapping table coverage or new staff being trained).  On my first visit, my friend and I were asked to relocate to a two-person table so that a party of four could sit in our spot.  The manager was very apologetic, and offered to pay for our bottomless mimosas (as they should).  Because they were so friendly and professional about the whole thing, we happily agreed to accommodate their request!I recommend making a reservation.  Though not always necessary, this place does fill up on the weekends.",0,0,0,Callie F.,"Manhattan, NY",9,13,0
5.0,10/12/2013,"Amazing places like this should NOT be so far up north, but maybe closer to where I live!! I had a small high school reunion and one of our friend who lived up near 115th recommended it. After some complaints about the hike up North, we finally agreed to meet at Lido since I saw such good ratings -- wow, incredibly impressed. Service(5): Very good! We kind of told our waiter that the sun was in our eyes and asked if we could switch tables. Even though there weren't an empty table, he quickly got an umbrella for our table and really took the time to make sure we were comfortable. White Polenta, Truffle Oil, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Poached Eggs (4): Very unique the way they make it. I would probably come back and ordered it again just because i loved how they made the Polenta. It was also an interesting mixed of ingredients that came together really nicely. The dish wasn't as light as I thought it would be and was probably my least favorite of everything else I ordered (doesn't say much since everything was delicious)Sugar Snap Pea, Arugula, Mint, and Basil with torn Burrata (5): Salad! I normally hate salad and I couldn't stop eating this salad. It was really refreshing and just went really well with the rest of our dishes -- the pasta and polenta. The mint really lightened the salad and it was just fun to eat!Spaghetti, Roasted Veal Meatballs, San Marzano Tomato, Basil (5): I could not stop eating this dish. I wanted to be selfish and not share with my friends and just take it all for myself. I really enjoyed it. Although the meatballs weren't the best meatballs I've had, I really liked the flavors and how they cooked the pasta almost al dente.

2.0,9/29/2013,"Lido, what a beautiful looking restaurant for this side of town.  Feels like this restaurant would be more at home in the village but it's a good thing restaurants like these open up to help improve the overall neighborhood.  Unfortunately, although aesthetically pleasing Lido fails to deliver on the quality of its food.  I came here for brunch today and although the menu looked quite appetizing, the delivery fell flat on its face.  The service was attentive, the kitchen was putting out dishes quickly, but unfortunately the execution of the food is borderline unacceptable and failing to deliver dining satisfaction in terms of flavor, texture, and value.First and foremost, the portions are small at Lido, so if you're eating brunch don't expect to be leaving perhaps satiated if you're a man but certainly not full.  I ordered the veal meatballs and poached eggs with broccoli rabe.  When I think of meatballs at restaurants like this, I think of something large like you would find at the meatball shop.  Instead imagine being served three meatballs that were probably the same size as your grocery store frozen variety.  The meatballs were essentially cooked on a small cast iron pan with broccoli rabe, marinara thrown over the top, two poached eggs plopped on top, and a single slice of grilled baguette thrown in.  One of the poached eggs was over cooked while the other one was perfectly done, the meatballs tasted of nothing, and the marinara sauce had a flavor reminiscent of your favorite canned variety of Ragu.  Truly a depressing dish especially since the amount of bread given wasn't even close to enough to pick up the rest of the tomato sauce.  Now since I was having brunch with the gf's mother who came into visit, I proceeded to polish off half of her grilled chicken panini  sandwich with pesto.  First, the sandwich lacked the characteristic grill marks of a panini, the chicken was slightly over cooked, and like everything I had in my last dish, bland.  Yes, it was so bland I could barely discern the pesto.  I guess the highlight of my meal was my coffee, at least that was done well....",4,1,1,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",167,876,249

It was my 'Cheers.'  Sad to say it no longer is :-(  I was there recently and the manager Susannah (who has seen me countless times) acted awkwardly in addressing an issue I had with a dessert I ordered.  I ordered the warm molten chocolate cake and twice it came to me cold.  The waitress walked over to Susannah to inform her of the error and Susannah had this hesitant 'what now' attitude.  She then proceeded to  walk over to the bar to see who it was that ordered the dessert before she made a managerial decision.  She literally stood within inches away from me.  Looked at me and walked away.  Seriously?!!!! Never spoke to me or apologized.  My friend who frequents Lido also agreed that it was very awkward.  I guess she's playing favorites at Lido.  I do hope she changes her attitude.

4.0,8/26/2013,"Came for brunch on Sunday and it was overall a great experience. Started off a little shakey since we were told the wait would be 20 mins for 2 people but it ended up being more like 40mins. We were seated inside cramped next to a booth of people that squeezed 3 people to many in their seating and right next to two other people near us, basically sharing the same table. The music was also blaring so we had some trouble hearing each other. I'm still working on my lip reading skills.Once I started drinking my bottomless mimosas things got better. The food was delicious. Portions don't look that large but I was stuffed and couldn't even finish the food on my plate. Bottomless mimosas were $13 our entrees were about $15. We also got a scoop of hazelnut gelato which was amazing, seriously get it if you have any more room for dessert. So in all it wasn't the cheapest brunch but it also wasn't terrible.I enjoyed the crowd here. Young, well dressed groups ready to enjoy some cocktails and a delicious brunch.

3.0,7/28/2013,"I came here for a graduation dinner with friends and family several months ago. We were looking for something good but close by in the Harlem/Morningside Heights area and after reading the reviews Lido seemed like a good bet. The hostess was very nice and understanding after I called earlier in the week and again on the day of to change the time of our reservation. We started off by sharing the the salt cod fritters and parmesan polenta tots, both which were fine but nothing special. We also shared a couple carafes of the white wine sangria, which I really enjoyed. For my main entree I ordered the strip steak and asked for it to be done medium. However it came out very, very well done. The waiter was very kind and sent it back to the kitchen right away, and the manager also stopped by to apologize personally and offer us desserts on the house, which I really appreciated. My second steak was done medium, but unfortunately was way too salty. At this point I decided to just eat the steak as it was.

2.0,6/23/2013,"Does Paula Dean own this restaurant? Sorry brunch was just that bad. This is Harlem. I live in Harlem. Understand we have a very diverse clientele in most restaurants and I love it. This place rubbed me wrong from the moment we asked the busser who poured our water if we could get some orange juice. He was SO nice and said of course and left. The waitress then came by to ask if we wanted something to drink ""Yep, we asked that nice busser man"" she demeaningly retorted ""Well, if you want something you cant ask him anything, so what do you want? Juice?"" It was rude. Sorry. And I'm not even sensitive. Then we noticed all the bussers were black guys and all the waitresses and hostesses were white. Which isnt a problem, but they demeaningly spoke to their ""second teir"" staff. It attracted a certain clientele which was very bazaar for the location. So for the food I'll make it short. I think it was my fault for going to Italian for brunch, but I mean come on. I got the poached eggs with veal meatballs which I could have made at home. My sister got the polenta which was fine but floating in sauce. My mother got the rock shrimp omelette which, not exaggerating, had three small shrimp, 4 leaves of spinach and a teaspoon of tomato in a BLANKET of egg. Just cheap. I will never go again.

I made a reservation for 1PM and one of our girlfriends was stuck on the train and running late to the point where she let us know that she would no longer join us. I advised the hostess with short blonde hair and disgusting attitude that we were no longer a party of 6 and the 5 of us were seated. Shortly after ordering our entrees and drinks my friend actually turned up and advised that hostess that she was running late but ended up making it anyway and asked to be seated at which point the hostess rolled her eyes and actually ignored my friend to the point that she had to repeat herself 3 times and finally led her to our table. I want to mention that we were still seated at a table for 6 patrons despite the fact that only 5 of us showed up initially.  After my friend  was able to sit down, hostess with a stick up her ass literally put the menu so close to my friends face she felt physically threatened by this woman! This person took my friend's tardiness so personally that she was hostile refilling her glass of water and picking up her menu. At some I overheard her complain to our server that our table was a joke and if there were only 5 of us it should have remained that way (tip: next time try a discreet whisper when shit talking your patrons) as if letting another person sit on the empty chair was such an incredible inconvenience to her.Sadly, the great food and attentive service from our server did not make up for the fact that this sore ass model wannabe hostess with no social tact whatsoever completely  turned us off from coming to this place in the future.",5,6,3,Aurinely L.,"New York, NY",13,3,0

5.0,3/16/2013,"Listen. If you live in the neighborhood, and you haven't been by this place, you are missing out. They have a kale salad that blows my mind. I've asked about how it is prepared and they told me that the kale is grilled before it is sautéed with fresh cooked and slightly mashed cannelloni beans, rosemary and a sherry vinaigrette. The result is a slightly smokey, slightly creamy, rather unexpected party in the mouth. Whatever they are doing there, it is magic. I like kale fine, but this is kale elevated to a higher level - I don't just crave it, I dream about it and I keep coming back for it. Dishes others have mentioned (truffled gnocchi, veal meatballs etc) are also standouts. But the main reason I come here is the staff - folks are friendly, they give a crap about you having a good time and it shows. Because of the vibe they create, a visit there, whether solo (sit at the bar, you are guaranteed to make friends) or with a group, you are taken care of and will leave a little lighter. I said in the beginning that if you live in the neighborhood you should check this place out - that is not to imply it is not worth a trip - it is just that it is such a gem, I almost want to keep the secret.",0,0,0,Eimear K.,"New York, NY",0,11,0

First time was with my parents for a late spring/early summer night out to eat, second was a January ""lets treat yourself to dinner"" kind of night. I can't remember what I had the first time, but the waitstaff was seriously on point for that first experience. Had my parents laughing, spending exorbitantly on wine, and we just left feeling completely satisfied. Food was obviously forgettable (I can't even remember what I had, let alone my parents), but the experience was on pointSecond time I went the experience was a bit off. I think the wait staff is a bit intimidated when they have someone who is there dining by themselves - they were kind of inconsistent as to when they were checking up on me (too much in the beginning when I was settling in, and not enough in the end when I was looking to high-tail it out of there) Maybe I should have sat at the bar and saved everyone the trouble! The food was great though - I got the spaghetti and meatballs (fall apart in your mouth balls (heh)) with a side of swiss chard, and then I had the italian version of a pot de creme which I just cant remember the name. The only things bringing this review down to 3 is the fact that I had inconsistent experiences both times and the prices are just TOO DAMN HIGH. I know Harlem is up and coming, but jeez louise.

I also got a side salad (pictured), which was just mixed greens some beans and lots of shaved parmesan-- huge portion for $5. It's also not on the menu, so just ask. The gnocchi was okay, and portion was small for the price. However, the dish was so heavy that a larger portion honestly would have been too much. There is bacon or lardon or some king of pork-like-fatty meat that wasn't edible for me in the dish. The gnocchi itself was very, very fresh and good. Cream sauce was okay, heavy and gave me a stomach ache, although I am sensitive to this kind of sauce. Salad was just okay, but very good portion for the price.

We ordered WAY too much food, but whatever, we still finished it all - and enjoyed it!For starters we got the mussels, which comes in a tomato-based soup and with a little spicy kick. Not my cup of tea, but my husband finished the whole thing.My husband ordered the pork chop and I had the butternut squash ravioli.

Prices are fair and entrees usually run around $13-$17. I chose the prosciutto panini and it was absolutely delicious.

4.0,1/14/2013,"As a Harlem native, born and raised here I've yet to experience a restaurant to arrive with this new wave that impresses me, except Lido! Low and behold, one hungry lazy evening I took a walk with my daughter to investigate and check out this new Italian spot; And boy were we happy we did! The food was surprisingly very very good. I can't remember what day it was exactly but it was in December of 2012. The food was so great (I'll tell you what we ate in a sec) I returned a week or so later with a close friend who's also a foodie on December 28th of 2012. On this evening we met the owner who was the most polite, non-cocky, even spirited restaurant owner ever. We were dining right next to the chef without knowing before she introduced herself after overhearing me go on about how great the kale salad was. Her name is Serina Bass and she was also very inviting and polite. The family style atmosphere of Lido's is an A+. I haven't sat at the bar yet but intend to soon. Let's talk food; the lasagna bolognese.. incredible, this lasagna literally melts in your mouth with its obvious special high end ingredients. The pasta was so light and delicate it marinated on my tongue in the most glorious way! We had a few appetizers which were all great but the kicker was the kale salad. I have never tasted a vegetable dressed to the 9's like this one! Laced with white beans & large/thinly sliced fresh parmesan cheese tossed about. How they embedded that 'grilled' taste into the kale I'll never know and I don't have to worry about it as long as I can walk down the block and grab some! Just as I intend to do tonight... !! #Highly recommend Lido's",2,0,2,Ginger L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,33,6

This wouldn't have been a problem if the meal didn't cost $17. Thankfully, the pancakes I split were pretty good.  I don't actually like blueberries, so I appreciated that there were enough to get the flavor, but not so many that I was eating blueberries and pancakes.  The pancakes were cooked exactly the way I like them, crisp around the edges, but not overcooked/hard/dry.Drinks 5/5The real saving grace of the meal was the unlimited mimosas, which I think cost $13.  Perhaps it's just the places I've been, but I'm always concerned that a bottomless mimosa brunch is going to come with some sort of fine print, but this was not the case here. Whatever orange juice was mixed in was flavorful and, at the same time, there was a good amount of champagne so I didn't feel cheated.  In addition, our waitress, whose name I did not get, lived up to my friend's billing as ""the best waitress ever.""  Rarely did I get my glass past the halfway mark without her rushing over.  In addition, she gave us ample warning about last call and did not slow up service as the end drew near.Overall 3.5/5Considering the quality/price of the food I had, 4 stars seems like a bit much, but I can't help shake the fact that I walked away from brunch today wondering about the next time I'll return.

I called the week before I have been assured they have my reservation and all will be OK. I arrive there I get a L shaped table 8 on one side and 4 on the other, which made it impossible for us to talk to each other. Not sure who was the one deciding that a L shaped table makes sense. A very rude manager provided me with a Hurricane Sandy excuse (!) which did not make any sense as well as an excuse that they are too busy to accommodate a large table. I don't understand, why not tell me when I made the reservation, or the week before when I called to confirm, or the day before, that you can't accommodate my party and I would have taken my business somewhere else? The dinner was a disappointment, as we were not able to all be together (after two months of planning). Also disappointing has been the fact that I was not offered a solution to fix the situation. Besides the management/ service being significantly below par, the food was decent, the place is a tad too loud & a tad too pricey.  I thought this would be a good neighborhood spot but given that the food had nothing terribly memorable, and they ruined the family gathering, I will take my business to other local spots.",2,1,0,Dana B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0

4.0,9/1/2012,"I ventured out to Lido about a year or so ago when it first opened for brunch. During that meal I remember that the restaurant was empty but the food was some of the best I've had in my neighborhood. I was puzzled why people were beating down the door. However, when I returned to Lido a year later for brunch, it's clear that the word has spread. The restaurant was packed and there was a great buzz in the atmosphere as waiters and waitresses scurried around from table to table and the bartenders mixed mimosas and Bloody Marys.The brunch menu at Lido is nothing out of the ordinary - omelets, granola, French toast, sandwiches, etc. However, the food is prepared with care and all of the dishes have a tremendous amount of flavor. Between the three of us that were at brunch, we ordered the following:    White Polenta: mushroom, ragu, parmigiano reggiano, poached eggs    Omelet with Mushroom: guanciale, caramelized onion, goat cheese    Baked French Toast: berries and cream, Vermont maple syrup    Side of Bacon    Grilled Bread: butter, house made jamI had the white polenta all to myself and I was glad I wasn't sharing. It was delicious. Overall, there was a lot of flavor packed into this small skillet. The polenta was topped with mushrooms in a sweet sauce which was then topped with two poached eggs and a perfectly seasoned grilled piece of bread. The yolks of the poached eggs ran into the other components of the dish and after shoveling down as much as possible with my fork, the bread was a perfect way to soak up and enjoy the remaining sauce.While I didn't have any of the omelet or baked French toast, I will say that judging by my friend's expressions and the clean plates in front of them, these dishes were also equally enjoyed.The one complaint I do have is about the side of bacon. I like my bacon extra crispy and unfortunately, Lido doesn't seem to endorse this. The bacon that we received was not crispy and dripping in fat. I mean, I understand that I'm not eating the healthiest food item in the world, but at least limiting the amount of fat I see dripping off of my food would be a nice consideration next time around.",1,0,0,David B.,"New York, NY",60,141,2

5.0,8/27/2012,"Amazing. My wife and I moved to SOHA last year and since then we've already seen an incredible influx of progressive restaurants, bars, butchers, and cafes. Lido, is without a doubt, at the top of that list. The other night, we sat at the bar and ordered dinner and drinks as it is the best seat in the house. Our bartender (can't remember his name!!) was super personable, knowledgeable and professional. The new head chef chatted us up almost immediately and the rest of the staff followed suit in friendly accommodating service. While food is king, service is just as important and they nail both with a genuine disposition. The interiors are more reminiscent of a Hamptons Mediterranean spot than a traditional Harlem lounge with clean lines, ivory colors, and wood accents. The food could not have been better! I had the red snapper and my wife had the orecchiette pasta. We started with the Salted Cod, which is whipped up with potato on top a grilled crostini. It tasted like a solid version of the best clam chowder on earth and at only $4.50, it was a steal.They have a great drink menu, sizable bourban and single malt list, and great wines to pair with your dish . We had the jalepeno-infused gin drink (can't remember the name of it) and had to order a second round as it was sooooo good and spicy - not to mention perfectly balanced.

The french toast was great, the berries super fresh, and the whipped cream...well how can you go wrong. It was super comfortable. No wait to be seated. It was a very hot day and they had about a kajillion air conditioners in there to make sure we all felt cool. Nice seating, a great place to bring mom and dad sometime. The bf liked his meal, which I believe was baked eggs of some sort. Cons:It was a bit of a long wait for food and for the check and our water was noticeably not cold.

2.0,7/4/2012,"UPDATE: After posting my original review below I received a very heartfelt apology from the waiter who served us that day. He didn't express any resentment over my review or make any excuses about the brunch service that day. I think it showed a lot of character and I was very appreciative to hear from him. I've decided to leave my review as it was originally written (this was our honest experience), but we will definitely be back and I will update again with the results.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I haven't reviewed anything in a long time, but unfortunately my poor experience at Lido has coaxed me out of ""retirement"". Sometimes you have an instance where the food is bad, or the service has slipped, or any number of other things, but today it was all of the above. Some of these things may be nitpicking but it all added up to a really disappointing experience.We came for brunch at 1:00 pm, the place was lively but not packed, there was no wait, etc. We were seated right away and offered drinks. We just requested water, which was served lukewarm without any ice on an 89 degree day. It was then 20 minutes before anybody came back to take our food order.Another 20 minutes later our waiter came back and very apologetically informed us that the kitchen had lost our ticket, so they were just starting on our food now and it would be a while longer. Ok, not a big deal we said with a smile, these things happen and we did appreciate him at least informing us. Shortly after, we received our Beet Salad which was very good. It tasted fresh and the goat cheese and basil ""fritter"" was hot out of the fryer. However we found the portion to be small, even by finer dining standards, especially for a $14 salad without any particularly exotic ingredients. This should have maybe been $9.Afterward we had to wait again - this time another 20 minutes for our entrees. My girlfriend's Poached Eggs with Broccoli Rabe and Veal Meatballs were competently prepared but lacking in seasoning. It also lacked any sort of bread or starch (or even maybe some grits or polenta) with which to soak up the copious amounts of tomato sauce and egg yolk. I see that Lido offers a side of grilled bread for $4 - I'm sure it's fine and comes with some accouterments that make it worth paying for, but to me that's not a replacement for a standard gratis bread service.My Short Rib Hash fared less well - pretty much everything in the dish was poor and it was clear that the plate had been sitting for at least 10 minutes. I think of a hash as being golden brown, with crusty potatoes, caramelized onions or peppers, and flavorful meat. The potatoes and peppers were almost non-existent (it was really just a pile of meat with a few dots of vegetables), and unseasoned with no browning or color on them at all. Almost as if they were just plainly boiled and added in. The meat was ok, but it was so liquidy that it completely soaked the English muffins underneath, which were already a mushy paste when they arrived. The poached eggs were overcooked, without any liquid yolk at all, and the little bit of Hollandaise (only about a tablespoon's worth) was solidified, with a thick film on it.You might think that the server, who had earlier apologized about the wait (without us complaining, for the record) would maybe follow up and check on us, but nobody stopped by at all for the rest of the meal. This is especially frustrating to me as a former waiter myself. The real shame is this - there are some businesses where you want to write a bad review. Your experience was so bad and you hated the place so much that you just want to rip into it. I don't feel that way about Lido - somewhere in there I think there is a really good neighborhood restaurant. Looking at the menus and reviews, I really wanted this place to be great. But it just wasn't. I will give them another shot at dinner service and hopefully things will be different.",3,0,1,Darren M.,"Manhattan, NY",4,64,10

Brunch is way better than Dinner.If I was just rating brunch, Lido deserves 4 stars hands down.  But, unfortunately, I've also had dinner at Lido, which was exceptionally underwhelming.Brunch...I had a superb time during my Brunch at Lido.  The Unlimited Mimosas had a lot to do that.  I may or may not have had nine... or so. I had the Baked Eggs as my entree.  This is served with cream, fontina, spinach and prosciutto atop three or four large cubed potatoes.  This was delicious and well balanced, the flavors and textures blended beautifully.  It was also fairly hearty, yet light.  I felt satisfied afterwards, without feeling stuffed. This is the perfect place if you're looking for a savory non-traditional breakfast -- no pancakes or heavy starches here.  I thought this to be a great change from the usual.  I did not have my signature eggs benedict, but the Baked Eggs were an excellent alternate.  Dinner....So after this great brunch, I was raving about Lido and excited to try them for dinner.  Big disappointment.  Most of the entrees sounded great on the menu, but were just lackluster in taste.My friend and I started with a Crostino course of Salt Cod & Potato and Prosciutto & Reggiano. The former was interesting, I wasn't expecting the texture to be as smooth as it was -- it was essentially a wittle bit of cod, with lots of potato. The latter was as expected.  Next, we shared the Dungeness Crab Cake.  This was ugh, such a disappointment.  It had more breading than I would have preferred, very little lump crab meat (mostly crab mush, and things that perhaps should have added flavor).  I had the Pappardelle, which was essentially served with a lamb ragu.  I added an insane and unfortunate amount of salt.  Like seriously, I couldn't taste a thing.  My friend had the Spaghetti, which is served with veal meat balls.  He found it underwhelming and I shared his sentiment.  I thought maybe the dessert would be a source of redemption.  Nope.  I didn't even finish my Apple Tart.The decor and atmosphere are excellent.

4.0,3/27/2012,"So, I have to preface this review by saying that I absolutely love Lido. Love the food, love the atmosphere. However, I'm not in love with one of the members of the staff. The past few times that I've been here, she has asked multiple guests to quiet down, blaming it on interfering with other guests. I'm guessing that she's southern because she does it with a smile and the slightest hint of condescension. Like, ""bless your heart."" (Kidding, I love southerners.) I've been to Lido around 10 times in the past year. It's a great place to swing by after work, grab a few delicious appetizers, and drink at the bar. Honestly, it has become one of my favorite restaurants in the City. Especially because of the Burrata and Poached Eggs. Mmmmm... Everything, everything is delicious.On to my story: I went to Lido with a party of 8 for brunch on a Sunday. A few of my friends were incredibly late, but they seated us anyway (a rarity!). We ordered the bottomless mimosas, some apps, and got to hanging. About 45 minutes into our reservation, the rest of the guests arrived. The staff was incredibly understanding; I mean, who doesn't understand weekend MTA schedules?!As more and more people filtered into the restaurant, my favorite member of the staff seemed to lose her mind. She went from table to table, telling (not asking) people to quiet down. ""You're being too loud for the other guests."" Really? Really? Everyone was talking at a pretty loud level. I hate to say it, but the next time I walk in to Lido and see her standing in the restaurant, I'll turn around and walk out.

Had reservation of 5 ( made out of town people , former New Yorkers though, to come all the way from Theater District to Harlem for a dinner at Lido) but none seems to enjoy the atmosphere that much. Yes it was almost  ""hard to hear one another"" noicy, but can't blame the restourabt for the Saturday's crowd, so I am not holding that against. What I am a little disappointed with is that the buss boy tried to clean our plates before we were done with the appetizers ( we were all sharing the salads and he just assumed at one moment its time to clean) . We started joking that we hoped not to end up with the bill at the table, without asking for it, and that exactly what happen to us.

We ordered 3 courses to share . Our first course was the Roasted Mushrooms ,marscapone polenta,truffle oil and parmesan served in a sizzling castiron pan. This dish is nothing short of amazing. Talk about creamy delicious and flavor packed. A must have. Our second dish was spagetti and roasted veal meatballs in a san marzano tomato and basil sauce. The sauce was delicious but the meatballs were not as successful . I found them to be gristly under flavored and chewy. The service in dealing with the spagetti issue is the primary reason I am giving 5 stars. The waiter and manager were both very honest in their assessment of this dish and we were happily surprised they removed it from the bill. Our third course was the braised short rib in a potato puree and remalade. This dish was beyond our expectations. Moist, tender and succulent are an understatement on the flavors and delicasy of the dish. It was aromatic and piping hot, perfect and the gremalach was beyond anything id had to date. We somehow had enough room for desert and we had the bread pudding wit the rum marscapone and wafer. A power finish to a power meal perfectly delivered on a busy Satturday night.There was absolutely nothing they could have done to provide better service and the chefs clearly have pride in what is leaving the kitchen.

2.0,2/22/2012,"Delicious food, bottomless mimosas, beautiful crowd, airy space. What not to love?Well... the service was downright rude. First off, they nearly gave our table away.  My boyfriend and I were ten minutes late, while the other half of our party was there. This is while my friend overheard the manager, I presume, tell a party-of-five-or-so that just walked in: ""ooh I'm sooo sorry! ... maybe ten minutes.""  In other words, in a few minutes, perhaps this group would be seated at ""our"" table.  So while our table was about to be given away because we weren't right on time, ""our"" table wasn't even ready for us, let along anybody.  Strange.  In the end, we arrived in the nick of time at about 12:43 for our 12:30 reservation and proceeded to wait another five minutes for a ""our"" table.  I'm calling the table ""ours"" because supposedly when they do reservations, they reserve specific tables. Once seated, we ordered drinks, entrees  and eventually dessert. Everything came out really fast which is usually a plus, but when you're double dating you want to catch up and enjoy a more leisurely brunch.  Even though we had the bottomless mimosas, we basically had to ask for refills. Our water glasses were empty as well, and no one asked how the food was either.  It was kinda like, they're food was so good, their deal so great, that they didn't feel the need to have any kind of service at all.Now the lack of service wouldn't have been so terrible because the food was good-- I had the baked eggs, yum!-- and the place is cute.  But then the manger, I presume, told us there was a 3 o'clock reservation for our specific table.  Yup, our round table in the corner by the window.  She added that she'd be more than happy to find us a place at the bar.  In other words, we were being kicked out. Honestly, I've never been so rushed in my life  My experience on Sunday was a serious disappointment considering my first time at Lido just a few months ago was a lot better.  My brother and I had a reservation around 2 or 3 pm on a Saturday or Sunday.  We had the mimosas, entrees, but no dessert.  We had a lot of mimosas and just for a long while just catching up.  The staff was very courteous then.  I guess a table of four is more of a commodity.  My thing is if you're going to do bottomless mimosas, or brunch for that matter, people will linger. This is not fast food. No matter the quality of the food, I do expect service at a sit-down restaurant. I won't be back.

Warm colors, woods, slightly rustic yet modern. I wanted to love this place. We asked the waiter about the lunch special being advertised outside and he told us that it was not available during brunch. Okay. Sad faces.So Russell and I shared the omelet with rock shrimp, roasted red pepper and spinach. It was eh. Way too eggy, not enough filling. Plenty of shrimp but really cheap with the spinach. The omelet was served with a side of burnt bread and a lightly dressed salad of mesclun greens. My coffee was also EH. I did not appreciate the rustic take on the bread.The service was very good. We were not rushed and our water glasses were always full. I guess that I am giving three stars because I found the food to be very mediocre. I'd like to go back to give dinner a try.

3.0,1/10/2012,"Debating between a three and a four because it's a nice restaurant with good food, but I left thinking I don't need to come back (except for brunch- that sounds pretty amazing).  Namely, you guys need to figure out the pricing structure. Food is actually very good and service is excellent as well as a nice space-- but over $100 for a pretty simple, quick meal for 2  is just too much, especially in this neighborhood. That means to come here has to be a special occasion and it's just not that type of place.  I want to spend half that and eat here all the time. We live down the street and came here for an early supper on a Saturday evening after running errands in the city- too lazy to cook. Our 1 1/2 year old daughter was with us so we were really 2.5 people, I guess.   I had the pesto and my husband had a pork tenderloin special. Our daughter had a plate of buttered noodles ($9- you guys need kid's portions or half plates or something. Come on- buttered noodles for $9?) It was all very tasty, but nothing incredible. Pork was good, but for close to $30 i'd like it to be outstanding. Pesto was also good, but was really just oil and large chunks of walnuts. Try chopping that stuff up and adding some more tastes!  I don't want to pay over $20 for a plate of noodles with some nuts on it.   My husband had a beer and then a glass of wine. He just asked for a white wine instead of looking at the menu. They brought one, but the one they brought was $15- why?  Like I said the food was good, the space is pretty and the service was very attentive and nice about our baby. We were happy until we got the bill and somehow couldn't shake the feel that it just wasn't worth it in the end.  Two and a half plates and two drinks, no appetizers or desserts and still clocked in over $100.... I think I'll just go to Bier International instead. Please rework your menu or do some specials. I know I sound like a total penny pincher, but I just want a decent bowl of pasta from time to time without having to work it in the budget.  Every time I think to go back, I tell myself for $20 more we can go out for a great lobster dinner or for about $90 less I can make some pretty amazing pesto at home.",2,0,0,Katie S.,"New York, NY",7,15,0

4.0,1/8/2012,"Let me preface this with some background, so you understand the nature of my review:-I live down the street from Lido and have been a frequent visitor for dinner, lunch and weekend brunch since they first opened. We were extremely skeptical initially because the place that preceded them was terrible - but what a surprise!-My boyfriend and I were both Italian majors in college, and take ""Italian"" food very seriously. We both lived in Italy for one year in Emilia Romagna, which is one of the culinary capitals, and his father is a native so he also grew up eating Italian food. Not that we're experts, but we definitely don't go to shitty Italian restaurants and have tried several of NYCs best with his family. I'd say any meal here is wonderful, especially if you live down the street. However, I have to say I have a soft spot for their winter brunch options which I think are more creative than the standard fare you'll find downtown. Brunch would definitely be worth the trip to Harlem if you don't live here. The White Polenta, Mushroom Ragu, Poached Eggs & Parmesan is the PERFECT Italian breakfast, their frittatas are legit, veal meatballs & poached eggs is stellar, and they have an omelet with guanciale on the menu?! Ummm.... hello! For $12 + $7 for unlimited mimosas until 3:30 - you've got yourself a deal with any of these options.Dinner is good too, and certainly passes our standards for Italian food, but it's nothing to go out of your way for in a sea of fantastic Italian restaurants in NYC, which is why I left off one star. However, if you're in the area, definitely give it a shot! We love this place primarily because it has a good wine selection, great atmosphere, and most importantly because it's down the street and isn't fried chicken. Definitely worth a try! We've recommended several people and they've all been satisfied.",2,0,0,Ashley S.,"San Francisco, CA",4,48,0

And boy, we got one! Every single dish was delicious and mouth-watering. The service was absolutely top-notch. Our waiter was cordial but not invasive and really made sure we were happy throughout the night. As for food, the stars of the night were:-the Octopus with Grilled Sweet Italian Sausage Vinaigrette, Orange, Potato, Olives--basically, I never want to eat anything again without sausage vinaigrette-the Pappardelle with braised lamb: classic winter fare that makes you feel cuddly and warm. The portion size was also perfection... not so much that I felt I had to roll out of there.-Grilled Hangar Steak: I'm a total steak snob--I RARELY if EVER order it out because I make a MEAN rare (really rare) steak at home and am always disappointed when they don't take my ""rare"" request literally. Lucky for me my honey did order it that night and it was too-die-for. I can't wait to go back--especially since I noticed their deep bar.

There were a half dozen other items that I really wanted to try but will have to wait for next time. Service was also really friendly and my mimosa was delicious.

3.0,7/24/2011,"I recently discovered Lido within the last week. I chose to dine there for lunch, since my usual dining spot's air conditioning was broken. Though I think Lido has a very delectable food selection and great  atmosphere, the little things like charging me extra for a slice of bread ( when my check average is 50 bucks) is a little disappointing.  I have come here 3 times in the last 8 days and today is the first time I felt  like they were being petty.  If you are trying to build a loyal following for your restaurant, and establish yourself as a neighborhood staple, then I would relax the policy on penny pinching, and focus on investing in repeat neighborhood business.  There's nothing worse then feeling like you have found a perfect new place only to find they don't value your patronage. Other than that the food is great.",1,0,0,Angela F.,"Manhattan, NY",13,6,0
5.0,7/24/2011,"At first glance, my dining companion and I thought we may be under dressed for Lido, because it looked so upscale.  I was also secretly worried that I wouldn't find anything affordable on the menu.  Wrong and wrong!The servers are very welcoming and we got a table right away.  The menu was quite fancy for what I'm used to eating (but you won't find a 6-piece order of chicken nuggets at Lido, so I had to adapt).I had the romaine salad with apples, croutons, riccota salata, and tonnato sauce.  It had the perfect blend of salty and sweet flavors.  He had the gnocchi. It didn't look like much on the plate, but was apparently so filling that he struggled to finish...a delicious struggle, though!  I tried a bit of it and it was great.  The servers continued to be very nice and extremely attentive, as they always made sure we had enough water in our glasses and all was well at the table.  I don't really have a large amount of fine dining outings to compare to Lido, and I thought the place was great, so 5 stars it is.  :)",1,0,1,Carissa L.,"Philadelphia, PA",84,324,6

The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating this time is because I asked for a cappuccino and was given a coffee - I didn't notice right away and our waiter didn't come back for a long time, so I just drank the coffee (which was good anyway).",1,0,0,Jillian T.,"Manhattan, NY",3,49,0

The menu had a lot of variety for brunch and creative egg dishes. Egg brunch meals came with a piece of awesome, crunchy toast. My friends had the omelet and the frittata and approved. I ate the veal meatballs with poached eggs and broccoli rabe, served in a pan with a zesty tomato-based sauce, I cleaned that dish up! Then we ordered the french toast. It had whipped cream and berries and this amazing bread that almost felt like cake. There are only two pieces of toast though, so next time I won't share! :) Service was pretty good and the atmosphere was uplifting with tons of natural sunlight and a spacious layout.This is one of the few times I have ventured anywhere in Harlem other than Kitchenette for brunch and it definitely will be repeated!",3,1,1,Catarina R.,"Manhattan, NY",439,29,0

The service was lackadaisically -- the waitress wandered off twice in the middle of people talking to her and once in the middle of an order placement with no explanation.

4.0,5/22/2011,"I love Harlem*. Lido's varied menu with interesting ingredients (including many types of Italian cheese and charcuterie sprinkled throughout) awaits you. The full bar and fancy coffees are great too. The service, though very nice, was in a minor way, spotty. A round of drinks forgotten by a server who would weirdly walk away before she finished talking to us - as in turning her head over her shoulder to finish confirming her order from her beeline to wherever she was headed next. But overall, for very fair prices ($8-12 for most brunch items) the polenta with poached eggs and mushrooms was very tasty, the omelets favored by all, the toast grilled crusty perfection. I look forward to returning for the truffle gnocchi ($18) and happy hour :) This place seems like a nice combination of many of the recent perks that Harlem has been gathering... a roomy bar, good food and not exorbitant prices (5 & Diamond I'm looking at you...). * I love Harlem because I can be seated on a leather banquet at a beautiful window, sipping cappuccino as I await my Italian brunch, I can turn to my right and see a man standing at a sidewalk phone booth, peeing into the phone book shelf then embarking into a 10 minute dialog with himself and the passing dogs getting walked on bedazzled leashes by their imported owners.

2.0,5/11/2011,"So I wanted to try as many restaurants on the Harlem Park to Park Pre Fixe Menu before this great deal ran out. After two great experiences, I found myself last night at Lido, ready for yet another great experience. I loved the decor of this place, it was very modern and trendy. The service was very attentive and I couldn't believe for a Tuesday night how busy it was. That must mean the place is good right? Well I have to say that Lido came up short on the food. We ordered one of everything off the menu which consisted of the mussels, and roasted beet salad. Both just a norm app in my book and they were good. For our entrees we had: Orecchiette, Sweet Italian Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Cherry Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I think my favorite part about this dish was the Brocoli Rabe, it had to of been drench in garlic which is why I loved it. The pasta was just pasta, really nothing out of this world. We also had the: Branzino, Roasted Red Pepper Livornese, Charred Onion, Organic Watercress, Fennel. I enjoyed this dish. I can't say I loved it. For dessert we had the tiramisu, which was just your standard tiramisu, nothing out of this world. I really wanted to like this place and I'm happy to say that I tried it, its just one more restaurant I can add to my list of places I've eaten. I don't think I'll be running back anytime soon. The portions were small but enough to feel full and if we had not had the pre fixe menu I don't think we would have ate here because it's rather pricey.",0,0,0,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",414,331,602

It's not that I mind spending $25 on chicken, but this is HARLEM. If we wanted to shell out nearly $100 for dinner, we would've taken the train downtown. My chicken was flavorless and very un-special. My husband's fish was better. Bright side, the mushroom appetizer was tasty and filling. We are both very disappointed that this place didn't meet our expectations for dinner - perhaps we'll go back for brunch. I heard the prices are better at brunch at least. Sidenote: we have a few friends who also live in the West Harlem/ Morningside area and we all share the same opinion, Lido is over-priced.

We have been there several time and each time at least one of us will order this dish.The decor is very comfortable and warm.

5.0,3/16/2011,"If in a name of an establishment one can immediately get a sense of what its proprietor(s) purport to evoke, then 'Lido', a new eatery in Harlem, certainly captures this concept. Italian for 'beach' and, aptly named after 'Lido di Venezia', just outside Venice in northern Italy, Lido patrons are treated to a dining experience reminiscent of being seaside in the Italian countryside. Conveniently located on Frederick Douglas Boulevard,  just a couple blocks from the B, C subway stop at 116th St, Lido is becoming quite a neighborhood gem and, an impeccable location for downtowners and uptowners alike - a perfect meeting spot, right in the middle of the island.The setting is inviting with a warm ambiance and consists of a full bar to your left (as you enter) and ample sitting in the main dining area. The décor is modern but classically so, with a tinge of understated elegance. It is suitable for a date, groups or solo diners (there's room at the bar to also have a meal), so whatever the occasion, it's versatile enough to accommodate whatever purpose.I love the food. The menu features a melange of 'ASSAGGINI' (appetizers/first course), INSALATA & ANTIPASTI, PASTA & SECONDI, and Dolci (dessert), etc. and, specially selected daily specials which are just as mouthwatering. I found most all my selections to be simply scrumptious. Some standouts for me on the menu are: as an antipasti, the 'White Polenta, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Truffle Oil' and the 'Marinated Beet Salad, Ribbiola di Roccaverano Fritter, Pistachio, Watercress, Saba', for a secondi pasta choice, the 'Ricotta Ravioli, Eggplant, Mint, Pine Nuts, Lemon' and the 'Gnocchi, Guanciale, Truffle Butter, Pecorino', and to cap things off, for dessert, the classic 'Apple Tart' - though at Lido, it's anything but. So if you're in the mood to treat your palate and it just happens to be Italian you fancy, head up to Lido; it promises to be worth the trip. And, who knows, you may just spot a celebrity or two - they're rumored to frequent the establishment. ;)",2,1,0,Yomi A.,"Manhattan, NY",119,14,0
