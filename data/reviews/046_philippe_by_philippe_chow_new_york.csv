3.0,3/27/2019,"This is defiantly over hyped. Went out to eat here for Valentines day the decor is nice, al though there was construction right outside there door.The place is SMALL, not cozy very small. My man in 6'7 and I am 5""10 so the little tables bunched together really wasn't our thing. Couldn't really have an intimate convo either because you hear everyone else conversation.The food was eh, I loved the veggie rolls. I order the curry chicken and couldn't shake the queasy feeling I got when I started eating. Wasn't the best, but Im west Indian its hard to like other cultures rendition of curry.Wouldn't look forward to coming here again its more of place for special occasion or to say you've dined there.",1,1,0,R R.,"Newark, NJ",6,44,8
4.0,3/24/2019,"Atmosphere is, as mentioned in other reviews, very trendy but upscale in a really great way. It's certainly pricey, but for some things like the Peking duck it's well worth it! Not a huge fan of duck, but I will honest it lived up to the hype - sliced to perfect, delicious sauce and green onions and cucumbers to dress it up on a warm pancake. My husband goes there a couple times a year just for the duck with ""the guys.""

3.0,2/23/2019,"Not worth it. I went last night for dinner with my friends, and was really excited to get some specific dishes based off Instagram and Yelp reviews, everything I'd read on the internet was a rave review and everything looked delicious. The service was 5/5, very nice, helpful, attentive. No complaints. The food was disappointing. Not only would I say it was not worth the very high price tag, but some of the items I would say would not be worth a low price tag either. 3/5 for food. The chicken satay, which everyone raves about, me (and my friends) did not like. The sauce tastes like literal pancake batter. Maybe it's too heavy on the butter...?  But frankly I was so excited to get it from all the amazing reviews (even here on Yelp), and this $21 Chicken Satay is probably not something I would eat again for free. It's so heavy and sweet and, well, tastes like pancake batter. Would personally NOT recommend this at all. The Vegetable Lo Mein with hand pulled noodles was delicious!  This was the dish I was most excited to try, and was not disappointed. Definitely recommend!!  This was worth it and so delicious!!!!We shared the Beijing Chicken, with it's sweet red bean sauce and candied walnuts, and we all thought is was too sweet. I've had sweet success before, but there was just so much sugar in this dish, and especially with the added candied walnuts. I'd also read great reviews about this dish, but it was just over the top too sweet and sugary.Some of the group got the Pork Soup Dumplings which were very good... Would recommend those.Overall, the service was very good, and I'm glad I went to have the Lo Mein that I was personally looking forward to, but the rest of the food was very disappointing and not something I would want to eat again.",2,0,0,Julia B.,"New York, NY",238,26,3
2.0,2/22/2019,I came to the restaurant to celebrate my birthday on 02/21/19 . The atmosphere was not kind. The waiter was very attentive to the couple next to me by asking  them multiple times were they okay and did they need anything  else. Not once did the waiter ask me or my date anything.  I also noticed that the coats of the other couples were taken as for mine it was on my chair.  I felt very uncomfortable.  My night was not what I had excepted. Being the only couple of color I felt out of place. And it is a shame because I was really looking forward to enjoying my birthday.

2.0,2/8/2019,I don't know why this place has good reviews but it is honestly overpriced white people's version of Chinese food. The atmosphere was loud and obnoxious kind of like a club scene.

The rest of the food that we ordered was mediocre & not worth $140. Would I come back? Sure maybe, I would give it another try.

I did and my experience this time was amazing. I defiantly recommend Beijing chicken and the Sweet and Sour chicken it was soooo good!. Their white sangria is also to die for. The Chicken satay are also good if your A fan of peanut sauce. But my overall experience was amazing on such a busy night!!!

4.0,1/26/2019,"This place defines a fun and trendy atmosphere, as the clientele is well dressed, the staff is beautiful, and the cocktails keep you wanting more. It's sexy. I didn't have the highest expectations because Philippe Chow is such a popular name, I would have imagined the fame would have diluted the quality, but not at all.My husband & I easily got a same day reservation to come at 8pm on a Saturday night which was great! We live in the neighborhood, so at the least we like to be well versed in local spots.Between the lighting, the music, and the drinks, all that was missing was Carrie Bradshaw. What we ordered for dinner is slipping me, but I do recall the Chicken Jo Lau which consisted of chicken breast, egg batter, pan-fried,sweet garlic broth. It was absolutely delicious and would order again. We experimented with sea food which was great too. I really enjoyed the chicken won ton soup. Though the food was definitely good, this spot is really about the vibe. This is not a value find but more so a representation of a New York City lifestyle.",2,0,0,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",128,329,4

Five stars for the food/0 for the service...With all the effort that owners, chefs, and purveyors put into the ingredients, recipes, and preparation, it is a terrible shame that bus boys should be able to suck on their fingers and bite their nails when they are in the dining room! Please, with all the attention to the preparation of the food, management must be mindful of how they train and oversee servers!! So baffled by this!

Entree I ordered their Spicy Velvet Chicken which was one of the best dishes I had in some time. My friends ordered other dishes such as the Crispy Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken.

But the service, food and general atmosphere leave a lot to be desired. That said, it is popular for a reason. I also don't like bagatelle. If you do, you may very well enjoy Philippe. For my money, if I am going to over pay for mediocre Chinese food, and believe me I am not above doing that, I would much rather go to Shun Lee Palace and enjoy the throw back atmosphere, the (slightly) better food and the captains uniforms.",4,5,1,Russell W.,"New York, NY",40,150,0

For dinner we had the Beijing chicken, seven spice shrimp, Crispy beef, green beans, pork fried rice, vegetable lo mein and sweet-and-sour chicken. Again nothing special.

Kung pao chicken: chicken chunks, with a sweet sauce, scallion, peanuts and pepper somehow it was still bland. 5.

We got the dumpling sampler and my favorite was the shrimp by far. The ribs were also very good and a big portion. The sauce on the chicken satay is amazing but I didn't love the texture of the chicken this time. For our main dishes we got the crispy duck, Kung pao chicken, crispy beef and pork fried rice.

The greeter lady promise we would all be able to sit together but, some how the birthday girl table is upstairs and her friends and family had to sit downstairs. It's horrible. We had people drive from NC to VA to NY to come here because we thought this place would be respectful and nice. It's so bad that the waiter came to our table and said... what do you guys want?

4.0,9/8/2018,First; let me start off by saying Yes the food is tasty.  I made reservations for 10pm I arrived a few minutes early. The hostess informed us that there was a little wait so we could either sit at the bar or sit in the little waiting area until they call us. The bar tender didn't not have us waiting long so that was a plus. I had the I had the Philippe passion drink that was ok m y date had the Midnight Mojito which was ok. So once our table was ready the hostess came over to me and said your table is ready you can bring your drinks up stairs but you have to close out the Bill. Her not knowing  it was already closed out as soon as we ordered So that annoyed me a little bit. Don't assume the bill was not going to be paid. Now as we were sitting around downstairs waiting I notice all the Caucasian entering the restaurant were walking in and being seated down stairs. Now It's time for me and  2 other African American couples to be seated and of course they Sat us UPSTAIRS. along with another African American Couple that was already up there.  (Not to make it  a race thing; but more of a being observant of what is going on) The only good thing about that was that it was more of an intimate setting since there were not a lot of people seated up stairs.  Since it was my birthday I didn't mind.  Now the great thing was how attentive our waiter was to all of the customers seated in the same area. I wish I could remember his name.  On another note I had the red dragon rose sangria that was really good.  I tried the shrimp satays they were also good and the Vegetable lomein was good as well. My date really enjoyed the  sweet and sour chicken.  So overall it wasn't a bad experience. Would I go back Yes but it's no rush!,1,0,0,Nikki B.,"Far Rockaway, NY",0,34,15

I only ordered it because it was one of the choices on the Prix Fixe lunch menu (please see the menu photo I uploaded from a week ago). As for the rest of the meal, the Crispy Orange Beef was the biggest disappointment. To describe the experience, imagine spaghetti thin strands of beef rolled in dense thick soggy fried dough with a tangy greasy orange sauce. Honestly, I've had better versions of this dish at my local Chinese restaurant. That shouldn't be. On the other hand, the dessert was delicious. I ordered the Warm Cocoa Brownie with coconut sorbet, strawberries and fresh whipped cream. The sorbet was especially good, perfect texture and balanced, not overly sweet. Very very good. Ambience - enjoyed the intimate atmosphere & cute Panda chopstick holders. Waitstaff attentive but not pretentious. Felt very comfortable. Nice diverse crowd, like seeing that. Seemed everyone was being treated with equal consideration. Like seeing that too. I guess my only complaint (and this is a complaint about restaurants in general) is that the waiter was Russian (I was curious so I asked) but the staff cleaning up were all Latino or minority.

4.0,5/19/2018,"I'll admit that I didn't want to like Philippe's. The idea of a super high-end Chinese food restaurant where there is an emphasis on beautiful people seating you and catering to your every need is a little much for me. I'm more low key and casual when it comes to dining out. The idea of spending crazy money on what I thought would be basic fare had me just seeing dollar signs every where. I did not want to like it here just for the simple fact that fancy people come here to feel fancy. I liked it though, I really did. I surprised myself.I came in about 20 minutes before my friend arrived and the hostess (who was beautiful, tall, and wearing one of the tightest black outfits I've ever seen - bless her and her genetics) greeted me immediately. I told her my friend had made a reservation and that I was early. I just wanted to sit by the bar. She smiled and walked me over to an empty seat. Friendly service so far which shocked me. I ordered a glass of wine at the bar while I waited and soon my friend arrived. Our hostess, along with servers in white suits and red ties, escorted us to our table. Very extra but very friendly. We didn't even look at the menu since my friend comes here often. Here's what we ordered:The crispy beef - SO good, would order over and over again ($24 for one person, $54 for 2 people - WHAT??!)The lettuce wraps with chicken which were, again, amazing ($18) and probably one of the cheaper menu items considering the portion sizeThe chicken satay skewers - the signature pink creamy covered chicken with the famous peanut sauce that everyone here orders ($18 for 3 pieces, gasp) and posts to social mediaWe also ordered some forgettable dumpling dish but the name is escaping me since the other dishes blew this one out of the waterVery fancy, very extra, and concluded dinner feeling very stuffed. As we wrapped up our meal, some famous rapper and his entourage sat next to us, or so I was told. His name escapes me because it was ""Lil"" something and I never heard any of his songs. Whatever. I do remember that they ordered the pink chicken though. A crowd pleaser!Dessert was up next - on the house, since the person I was with knew the staff well and frequents this place. I powered through dessert even though I felt like a beached baby seal. They brought out cappuccinos, fruit salad (this was $16 when I checked the menu later), sorbet ($12 when I checked) and a flourless chocolate cake ($14). I was ready to be rolled home since I did DAMAGE on these desserts. They weren't unbelievable or anything, but everything was fresh. Knowing how much these would normally cost, I didn't want anything to go to waste.Shockingly, I think I'd come back for a special occasion. I don't think I could bring myself to make this a habit or become a regular here to the point where I get my own free round of desserts, but I appreciate the quality food and service here... even though it's all a bit extra.",3,4,0,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",239,409,960

The dumplings were perfectly cooked, and the spare ribs mouth watering. As our entrees we split the lobster lo mein, chicken jo lay, and crispy beef and they were all good. The crispy beef is triple fried and is beyond delicious. For dessert we split the pear tart, chocolate lava cake, and baked Alaska. I'm not a fan of chocolate cake in any way but I actually enjoyed it. I had never had baked Alaska so that was a pleasant surprise - did you know it's ice cream cake!? News to me! It's presentation is super fun. Wrapped in cotton candy and set on Fire it was certainly a treat. I absolutely enjoyed my evening here and will be sure to come back in the future.

In case you can't tell, I've been using the past few months to comprehensively assess -- both in NYC and nationwide -- the best Peking duck on offer. Phillipe ranks high. As high as Hakkasan? It's tough, and I need to meditate a little more. But what we had was pretty sublime and unbelievable, and it beats the Price to Portions Ratio (P2P) at Hakkasan. Perfect cutting and distribution of the lean and the fatty, the crispy and the squishy on the skin.The rest of the meal? Ehhhh.... Dumpling sampler was insulting from a P2P perspective. We're talking 5 dumplings. I could get 25 of these at Golden Unicorn -- with the same quality -- for the same price. Handpulled noodles were OK but nothing special, and again, outrageous P2P. I ate the whole thing in 3 gulps. Sweet and sour chicken was a joke and tasted like anything you could order from your typical greasy spoon corner joint. What?!Another issue that ultimately prevents a vaunted #MerlinFIVE: poor logistics. We had a reservations at 8 PM but nobody seemed to know when we'd get seated.

3.0,4/3/2018,"During my hunt to find a nice restaurant in the city for a celebration, I stumbled on Philippe. At first glance, I thought the reviews looked good and was within walking distance of our hotel, but now I wish I'd investigated more thoroughly as our experience was alright but nothing special.For appetizers, we ordered the Peking duck spring rolls, pork soup dumplings, crispy kale, and salt and pepper eggplant. For entrees, we ordered the Chilean sea bass, wok-seared branzino, filet mignon, crispy beef, and vegetable lo mein.Everything was good - my family loved the Chilean sea bass and the filet mignon, and I was quite impressed with the eggplant. But for such a high price point, I expected great across the board - especially in terms of the flavor profile and presentation. The crispy kale was bona fide kale chips on a plate, and the vegetable lo mein was not that far off from what you could get at your local takeout place. I do wish they had a couple extra vegetarian items on their menu, as I basically covered the full gambit in my order.There was always someone nearby to take care of our every need. Service was on point, and I felt like at some points there were double the number of waiters than there were people at our table. Because of the high cost of our bill, I had correspondingly high expectations and the full dining experience didn't live up to the hype. Especially given the limited plant-based options, I probably would look elsewhere for Chinese food.EDIT: The day after posting this review, the general manager reached out to me saying that he and Chef Philippe would personally take care of me the next time I came to visit.

2.0,3/21/2018,"Unfortunately, I would describe this restaurant as an overrated overpriced Chinese restaurant.. My friends and I were visiting New York and really wanted to come here for the Peking Duck, regardless of the ""okay"" reviews it had. We definitely learned the hard way why; food and service was not up to par and everything was overpriced. We ordered: Peking Duck $75 (4/5) it was good, but overpriced (Average price for Peking duck is $50). *Tip*: We called in to pre-order it as it takes 45-60 minutes to prepare.Hot and sour soup $10 (2/5) it was okay and overpricedChicken Flat Noodle $18 (0/5) bland and overpricedChicken Satay Skewers $18 (2/5) meh, overpricedCotton Candy Baked Alaska $18 (4/5) this was good, probably the only thing I can see matching its price point.Service (0/10) absolutely horrible, for a fine dining restaurant you would expect the service to be above average. Our waiter barely paid any attention to us as he was too busy trying to suck up to the table next to us. Basically gave us the impression that we were not good enough for his service even though we ordered one of the most expensive dishes on the menu.

3.0,3/9/2018,"Let me start off by-- HOW DO YOU OVER COOK WHITE RICE? Or dare serve plain white rice at these prices?Warning- It just gets worse.I must say I felt rushed to order and complete my meal since the waiter was going off lunch duty.  He kept disturbing and standing over me and I had to ask him to give me space. I can say for what I was spending it was NOT a good idea. I loved my chicken satay and my friend said his hot and sour soup was perfect. The chicken noodle is over priced and just mediocre. The chicken with walnuts is dry and could be candied walnuts! However, I was not pleased with the overcooked crispy steak and had it made over. The brownie with coconut ice cream was nothing special. The whipped cream was just  okay. The bathroom was dirty, the floor was very nasty and I used it after one of the cooks. It was very dark in the bathroom and up a few steps- I don't know how handicapped or wheel chairs would be treated here, as the eating area is down stairs. When you walk in the place looks dark and closed. The modern soft rock music played through the meal which I found odd it wasn't more cultural. There were plain tables with white tablecloths very close together and we were seated so close to the next door couple -- I felt like it was privacy invasion!! There were plenty of other empty tables. There was a long bench seat along the wall and I was in the  crack of the pillows feeling unbalanced till the neighbors left and  I  was able to move my table. The food is costly lunch- we actually had the $28 lunch special-if I went to Chinatown it would have been $28 for both of us with FREE TEA! If that was included no one offered.For the price and  the neighborhood: I would have loved to be WOWed by a special meal or presentation. Nothing rated to give that OH- Look, I am eating Food on East 60St and its so special. The place looked more like it was saving on electricity and rushing to get us out. I was even still eating and they were so eager to say-- are you ready for us to prepare desert. Like seriously.... there was a party of 8 -- that sat after us and was getting their food as I was eating.Adding in: My friend gave the server $5 for recooking my meal When I gave the bill back- the same server asked to I want change. Yea, sure take another $7. How much tip do they think they deserve when he wasn't even the original Server? {0.15 x $48.00=$7.20}. You didn't do much but annoy me. You deserve $12 that's over 20% - Over Priced tips and food. mhm... makes me wonder.... Also, I didnt see Al Sharpton dining on 3/8.",5,1,0,Correy K.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,145,37

I order the peking duck spring rolls and they were really tasty.  The added crunch of the wonton wrappers made them even better than regular peking duck because he gave it an added texture.  I understand the lobster main dish is a 2 1/2 lb lobster.  I will have to try that next time I go.Damn Al just looked up from his conversation ...

3.0,3/5/2018,"My sister booked a reservation here for my family while we were staying in NYC. The restaurant has a great vibe and atmosphere with a shiek selection of music and subtle bass thumping in the background. We ordered the peking duck spring rolls, pork soup dumplings, crispy kale, and salt & pepper eggplant as starters. For entrees we got the chilean sea bass, wok seared branzino, crispy beef, and filey mignon.  My favorite dish was definitely the filet mignon and chilean sea bass.While the food was cooked well and tasty, I was a bit unimpressed with it based on the price. I feel like for this price category, there should be more creativity and artistry expressed in the dishes to set them apart from your typical Chinese restaurant. They don't do anything flavor-wise that made me go ""DAMN, that was good."" The presentation was mediocre but since it's dim in the restaurant, you can't see too much detail anyways.I would say that the service was on point. There are a ton of waiters walking around all the time so they make sure that you are taken care of.If you want good, authentic Chinese food, just go to a hole in the wall or family restaurant in Flushing and pay 1/3 the price.",2,0,1,Abben H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",403,72,174

Now, let me tell you about our experience...When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and taken to our table upstairs, which probably was the most cramped area. We asked to be moved to a different table, as they put us between two tables and we were so close to the other tables that it felt like we were sitting with the people next to us on both sides. They accommodated us with no problem. Now lets move on to the food... My boyfriend had the chicken satay to start; he was not a fan. He told me that the chicken had no flavor and the sauce tasted like melted peanut butter. To me, it looked disgusting (HAHAHA, do not tell him I said that!) I chose not to have my own appetizer. Now, they had a main course and the special valentines day menu. One item on the Valentine's day menu which we ordered was the bottle of Rosè. Something I found strange was they never left the bottle by our table in a bucket of ice; instead they took it with them to who knows where... maybe even helped themselves! I really mean this, since the bottle only had like three and a half servings/refills of a champagne glass.The main courses were really good.

I normally don't like peanut sauce but the sauce on the chicken satay was very delicious and didn't taste at all like peanuts. For the main course I got the crispy orange beef. When I tell you I will be back for that beef !!!!! I will be back for that 100 percent. It was small crispy pieces cooked just right. We had the cotton candy dessert and it was lit on fire.

4.0,1/26/2018,"As someone who grew up on homecooked Chinese (Sichuan) cuisine, I can see why a lot of diners might shy away from Philippe. The prices are definitely higher than your typical Chinese restaurant, but neither the food nor the dining experience here is typical.I dined here with a larger group so was able to sample a number of dishes. From the appetizers, I would recommend the Chicken Satays which are super tender and served with an addictive peanut sauce. The noodles are also solid, but my preference was for the Vegetable Lo Mein, which are hand-pulled and served with fresh vegetables and cooked in an addictive sauce. The Lobster Noodles were also a seafood lover's delight, with plenty of chunks of real lobster meat.I think where the restaurant really shines is in their Peking Duck, which is carved tableside and there's elements of showmanship and skill from the chef. The skin is crisp and packed with flavor, and the meat has just enough fat to make for a delicious bite. It's served with pancakes, hoisin, and celery, so you can make yourself the perfect Peking Duck wrap. The Beijing Chicken was also a group favorite, featuring tender chicken meat in a bright red sauce.For the dessert: the Cotton Candy Baked Alaska makes for a great closing spectacle, and features a Baked Alaska hidden in a dome of cotton candy. Yes, there's fire, and yes, it's delicious.For special occasions, I'd recommend visiting Philippe for a unique dining experience and a modern take on traditional Chinese dishes.",34,9,23,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

3.0,10/26/2017,"You probably check out the menu before you head out to test out another restaurant. We did, so as far as the prices, we knew what we were getting into.Confirmed - prices on these small servings of Chinese food equal what amounts to what is being charged for the new iPhone X.. outright high for Chinese food. But we give them some latitude due to the high rent and enormous bus staff they have working there.Cuisine - we had the special Mr. Chow Noodle Pork flavoured dish. Supposed to be spicy but it was not as hot as the Black Shimp with Black Bean (which is okay with me). What wasn't okay was their signature noodle dish came out lukewarm.We also ordered the Crispy Shrimp and Chicken dish which had a bit of golden garlic in it. A dry tasty dish. May want to get something with some sauce just so you can add it to this dry dish.Meals were served with a bowl of white rice. Want Brown Rice? Pay $6 extra. Nothing special about the taste of the white rice so all you get from it is an elevated blood sugar level on your glucose test. The meals were good but did not live up to the very high price tag (average $24 - $32+) per dish.Wait staff - unusual, we had the one token Asian waiter and several non-Asian bus staff. The service was impeccable and our water goblets were always topped off without asking.Seating - As you enter you hit the busy bar area first. Then you enter the back where you turn right and the room splits into a long room to your right, and the squared off room to your left. The squared off room seemed like it was reserved for the quieter crowd whereas the longer one on right seemed like it was for party goers or louder audience. Kudos for service - great for impressing a date, but tables a bit close so no privacy. I overheard the conversation of the two Gloria Vanderbilt ladies next to us, more info than I needed.It seemed to be one Asian waiter, one Asian Hostess, and a few dozen non-Asian workers. Don't know who was in kitchen.. perhaps Pillippe?Ambience -  Progressive and clean.Seating - During the week we arrived at 6:00 PM and it was empty. Seated right away. Arrive at 7:00 PM and it pretty busy.Prices - Very high but not shocking for the area we were in. A dinner for two guests ordering one appetizer and two main courses (no drinks nor desserts) set us back $92.00.Thoughts - Asian cuisine, I've had better or at least same quality in Chinatown (NYC and Brooklyn) but the service here wins.

4.0,9/26/2017,"I recently attended a private function at Philippe and was quite surprised at the level of service and the quality of the cuisine, especially since we were a large party. The private room allowed ample space for the nearly 30 of us to chat and mingle with a glass of wine in hand. We sat down to a fixed family style meal with several courses. Our appetizers were my favorite course, with vegetable spring rolls, duck spring rolls, spare ribs (my favorite dish of the night), steamed dumplings, ginger salad, and shrimp dumplings. The pork dumplings, although a bit watery (that is my overall opinion on steamed dumplings in general, not specific to Philippe), were presented in a traditional basket and were obviously crafted with such precision and care. They were beautiful to look at. Our main courses included filet mignon and green beans, chicken and broccoli, lobster with ginger sauce, Chilean sea bass, and Peking duck. The filet mignon was my favorite dish, as you got the familiar taste but with a much higher quality cut of beef. The lobster was just okay, I didn't find the meat to be super flavorful but the sauce was quite tasty in moderation. The Peking duck was served traditionally and had a perfect crisp to the skin. The only dish I didn't care for as much was the chicken and broccoli, which didn't seem to differentiate itself from any other Chinese restaurant.For dessert, we had a chocolate cake, scoops of sorbet in coconut, mango, and passion fruit flavors, and the fortune cookie cake.

It is spot on, each and every single time I go. Let me first start by saying the service is grade A, waiters with impeccable manors are extremely attentive and always within a glance away. The chicken satay and beef satay are a MUST along with the lettuce wrap (chicken). The portions are actually decently sized and the mixture of spices and zangy tastes will have you writing your own yelp review. Kung pao chicken and crispy beef are JUST as good of mains as the Satay's and lettuce wraps are for appetizers.

1.0,9/9/2017,"Terrible Customer Service. Don't be fooled by the glitz and the glam. Mediocre food.I came here for a birthday celebration and left with a headache. Not only was there clear seating segregation(most of the minorities whether big or small groups were placed in the back), the waiter  incorrectly charged us as well. Since when do waiters take tip while taking payment at the same time??? Tip is given last. This man had the nerve to assume his tip amount. The food wasn't that great for us to even consider a tip that hefty. As soon as I noticed, I told him about the mischarge. He claimed to make the change. I left and realized that the changes were not visible on my bank statement. I called the company to discuss the issue and also pointed out the seating arrangements. Instead of apologizing, the man on the phone dismisses the conversation. Talk about awful customer service!

2.0,8/15/2017,"Don't waste your time here. Food is overpriced and bland. It's an upscale Chinese restaurant that's unnecessarily upscale. Save your time calories and money and head to Chinatown for $7 dishes that taste way better than here. We came here on a Friday night. It was pretty busy, with an intimate setting and white table cloths. The only reason I give it two stars is because it wasn't terrible food, it just wasn't good either and definitely not worth the prices. Also being Asian I have higher expectations for Asian food. Had it been cheaper I would've given them another star, but for these prices I expect great food. For appetizer, we ordered the vegetable wrap, chicken skewers, & the Peking duck rolls. The vegetable wrap was bland, chicken skewers were an ungodly color of orange, and the rolls were way too oily. For entree, the only thing that was decent and eatable and somewhat tasty was the Bronzino fish. Dessert we tried the mochi, fortune cookie red velvet cake, and another chocolate cake. Mochi was fine (can't really screw up mochi but you can probably get the same ones in the freezer isle of a supermarket). The fortune cookie cake was a red velvet cake covered in red sprinkles with pocky and a fortune cookie on top. Nothing special there either and tasted cheap especially with all the sprinkles. I can say that service was amazing here and they were very attentive. But other than that, I would never come here again. If you want an authentic experience for chinese food, go to Chinatown.

2.0,8/13/2017,"Just another testament to the disparity between OpenTable ratings and reality. I had super high hopes for Philippe when I booked a reservation during Restaurant Week for me and my parents for my dad's birthday-- an upscale Chinese restaurant with so much acclaim was something new and exciting for us. It was a change of pace from the restaurants of Flushing and Chinatown, which tended to be more on the crowded, slightly dingy side. But I'll take a dingy, crowded restaurant/food court in Flushing or Chinatown any day if it means I'll get delicious Chinese food out of it. Philippe might be a place of white-coated waiters, and sleek, well-manicured hostesses, but they are not fooling anyone with this food (well, except some celebrities, apparently). I want to reiterate that we ordered from the Restaurant Week dinner menu-- maybe Philippe's normal dishes are different, but the food we got was not something I expected out of a place as highly acclaimed as Philippe. Appetizer:The tuna tartare appetizer was beautiful and tasted just as great, but the spinach salad looked like someone just dumped a bag of spinach into a bowl and brought it over. The Peking duck rolls were not much different from your standard egg roll, aside from the tiniest bits of duck meat inside. Definitely more egg roll than Peking duck, imo.Entrees: Filet mignon, Peking chicken, spicy prawnsThe star in this course was the filet mignon. The serving was pretty generous and the meat had a nice texture and wasn't too chewy. The spicy prawns, on the other hand, were lukewarm and basically just some fried nuggets thrown on top of a bed of what seemed like duck sauce with chili flakes (???). Lastly, the Peking chicken. Maybe I lack the nuanced palate to make any judgments, but this tasted no different from sweet and sour chicken you'd find elsewhere (sorry). I guess what also irks me is the labeling of Peking chicken when there is no indication of what makes it ""Peking"". Peking duck needs no explanation but what is Peking chicken??Dessert: Dark chocolate layer cake, fortune cookie red velvet cake, assorted ice cream and sorbetDefinitely Philippe's redeeming factor. The chocolate cake was not too sweet (that sounds like a bad thing but it's actually perfect in conjunction with the other two sugary dishes), and not too big either. The assorted ice cream and sorbet came with mango sorbet, raspberry sorbet, and vanilla ice cream-- the sorbets were very refreshing and not too tart, and the vanilla was... you know, vanilla. Aaaand the fortune cookie red velvet cake. I have to be honest-- I was most excited for this part of the meal. The fusion of an American classic with a Chinese-American classic sounded like a really fascinating and promising dish, but alas, it was the most disappointing one. I kid you not: it was a red velvet cake. Covered with red sprinkles. With one fortune cookie plopped on top. And a Pocky stick stabbed through the middle. I still think it has potential to be developed, but at its current stage... I have nothing else to say.Service was pretty good. I was disappointed in the 20-minute wait time, despite having a reservation and being there on time (my parents were literally two minutes late, but still). The service otherwise was pretty wonderful, and the waiters and busboys were very attentive. So if you wanna feel like (or are) a posh celebrity dining on mediocre, overpriced Americanized Chinese food-- sure, come to Philippe. Otherwise, take your money to Flushing or Chinatown.",2,0,1,Carlen Z.,"New York, NY",283,15,67
2.0,8/13/2017,"I wish my experience was better here but the food wasn't good. The chicken satay tasted like something you'd get served on an airplane or hospital. The peanut sauce on top had no flavor and as it was paired with non crispy flavorless chicken, so the entire dish was texturally off. I got the velvet chicken as an entree and the chicken was overly mushy & tasted like it came from a soup can. My friend got the nine seasons special prawns and she couldn't eat it, the sauce was terrible and the shrimp were hard like it was over fried. The only reason I'm not giving a 1 star is because the drinks were decent and the bar tender was attentive so A+ for service.

This place has a lot of celebrity buzz but I was definitely not impressed at all. The service sucked , there was no warmth or personality. The waiter was extremely rude , he didn't want to explain anything to us even though we explained to him it was our first visit here. He never once came over to check on us. We had two encounters with him. He took the order  and he brought the check simple he didn't earn that $35 tip but I digress shawty! The food was BOMB and that's was the only thing that kept me sane. I didn't waste my time ordering any alcohol after reading reviews about the drinks and they were super OVER priced  not surprised at all. The food though listen , the chicken satay tasted like chicken cheetos on a stick and I say that in the most amazing way it had such a familiar taste to it so good ! The szechuan pork and shrimp dumplings took my taste buds on a ride. Don't get me started with the 9 seasons prawns those are not for the weak OK they are SPICY and will take you to the moon or bathroom depending on how your stomach works. For dinner I chose the Beijing chicken and it did not disappoint now that basic ass jasmine rice they give you "" complimentary"" with every meal they can keep. We had to order a separate order of chicken fried rice for $14 bucks that did feed 3 people but trust it wasn't a lot.

After eating out at very high end restaurants and the other Phillip locations like the one in LA, I left so angry and so unsatisfied that I just had to say something and warn future customers. Yesterday as I was trying to enjoy a meal with my boyfriend I was handed a cocktail with a fly...I immediately told my server and instead of a warm apology I got an attitude. He made me wait 15 minutes for a new drink and acted like the fly in my drink wasn't a big deal which I thought was disgusting and repulsive. He didn't even take the drink away and left it right by me. When I mentioned the manager I was informed that he was on his way to see me but never even came. I had to complain multiple times about this drink for them to at least take it off my bill. This is not the type of treatment anyone should ever experience at a high end restaurant.

When my family and I arrived, we checked in and was told we would be seated next, I watched multiple parties come in and get seated before us. I went back to the check in podium about 20 minutes after I was told to wait to see what the status was and I was told that I had not been checked in. THEN!! When we were going to be seated we were offered seats in the wine cellar... I accepted because I did not know what it would entail, when we got down to the basement , it smelled ! It was very cold and dark with a leaking ceiling.I had my one year old son with me who began to cry when we got down there. Also !! There were only African Americans seated down there which I am. I took high offense to being offered to sit somewhere it was cold smelly and dark because I would be seated faster. Then when we were seated upstairs the waiter was not friendly or patient, he would ask us what we wanted and walk away while we told him what we wanted. He seemed as though he was in a rush.

3.0,7/12/2017,"I never understood the hype behind Philippe chow. I've came here on numerous occasions and the food is nothing special at all. This is one of those resteraunt's were you're paying for the name. I swear people make such a big deal out of this place and make it more then what it is due to the celebrity hype surrounding this resteraunt.The service here is top notch i can't deny that, but when your paying close to $500 for a party of 4 for some over priced Chinese food it damn right better be. This food is the same food you can get at any great Thai or upscale Chinese resteraunt. There's really no difference in my opinion. The ambiance and decor is top notch and it is a beautiful resteraunt located on the upper east side, not to far from central park. Other then the service here their's really no ""It"" factor when it comes to Philippe chows. Is there always celebrity's here? Absolutely, every time i've came to eat here there has been big name people in this resteraunt and the list goes on when it comes to big name people. I have been coming here for years and my right hand friend's friend Darwin use to manage here, so it was always a walk through and love.The food is decent, but like i've stated earlier the prices here are ridicules and the food is nothing special. The wait staff also is hit or miss and even though service is great, you can also get that one waiter who caters to you all day, but expects a outrageous tip because thats what he's accustomed to. I use to come to Philippe chow when you was able to smoke bud in the basement cellar and this going back 2-3 years. Yes you heard right, if you was a some body or knew someone you could do anything in this resteraunt, which was mind boggling to me my first time coming here with my boy, bit that came to a end with people started complaining about the smell of marijuana :). What I do like about Philippe is its a huge resteraunt with upstairs, down stairs, and a beautiful wine cellar in the basement thats very intimate for date's and special events. They also have a beautiful full bar on the ground level with multiple sides to eat on the main level. The upstairs is amazing as well. If you don't mind spending a couple of hundred of Chinese food i guess you'll enjoy this place. The portions here are minuscule, so their's no just ordering rice and a entree and only spending $ 100 dollars. You're coming out of you pocket here, but if you're coming here for a special dinner its worth it. You cant put money on a love one's birthday or anniversary, but if you're  just coming here to eat, you're better off going else where. You'll get your money worth some where else and for half the price. Overall this place is over priced Chinese fusion at its best.

To be fair I came prepared to try the lobster fried rice but it was no longer on the menu. The shrimp fried rice was a bit bland but came alive with some Hoysin sauce however I pretty much lost my appetite when I saw the shrimp hadn't been cleaned and deveined. Needless to say I was very annoyed let alone disgusted. This place is far too expensive to not do basic seafood prep.

The Beijing Chicken has a great texture and the red sauce is sweet and sour and sooo good.  The Bronzino was delicious. The hot garlic taste is so refreshing. The shrimp fried rice was perfect and the green beans were perfectly cooked. Firm but tender and quite flavorful. Anyone looking for some out of this world not your local takeout Chinese should definitely eat here.,1,0,0,Sabrina P.,"Valley Stream, NY",25,55,402

The food there is amazing but the staff is super rude, especially he manager ( didn't catch his name) but who had the nerve to rush us from our party of 9 who were having a wonderful time for my best friends bachelorette dinner, had nerve to rush us saying another party was in need of the table.

5.0,2/16/2017,"Came here for my birthday dinner and definitely was not disappointed.  I've eaten at Philippe a few times prior to my birthday, but I haven't been back in years!  The atmosphere is chic and romantic with dim lighting and intimate setting. Regarding food, I would recommend to start with the chicken and beef satays and lettuce wraps.  The portions are made for sharing so it can fill you up before your entrees arrive.  As a main course, we ordered the crunchy beef, kung pao chicken and mixed fried rice. We definitely ordered a little too much (or we just didn't bring enough of our appetite!) because we ended up taking home a doggy bag.  Nonetheless, the food was delicious and memorable. When it came to dessert, it was like a mini live show right in front of our table.  Our waiter brought out this plate of what appeared to be a huge fluff of cotton candy.  Then he began to torch the outside of it, and as it melted there was a strawberry shortcake-type of cake inside! And trust me, the dessert tasted as good as it looked. I think what made Philippe stand out from other NYC restaurants, was their impeccable service.  From the busboys, to our waiter and even the floor manager, everyone was so friendly and attentive to our needs.  We felt right at home and the staff really went out of their way to make my birthday a memorable one!",1,1,0,Celine T.,"Manhattan, NY",155,19,19

5.0,1/29/2017,Let's start with I LOVE Philippe Chow's. They use to have a location on Long Island that I use to go to all the time so when I am in NYC it is a must go to for upscale Chinese food. If you like good Chinese well look no further this is the place for you! The service is always good and the food is always consistent and delicious every time I go. The main dish portions are kind of big and good for sharing. I highly recommend getting lettuce wraps and chicken satay for starters. For my main I normally go for either Kung Po chicken or crispy beef with a side of fried rice.

2.0,1/28/2017,"Went here for my bday and because it's also Chinese New Years. Very weird atmosphere. For an upscale restaurant, people were wearing jeans , sneakers, some were dressed as if they were just going to Burger King- on the opposite - were what looks like rich white old people and their fur coats.   The hostess and hostesses were bit snotty. We had to wait a while for our table despite  having reservations. Food: spinach salad- it was fine, good salad dressingVeg. Lo mein with hand pulled noodles: lacked vegetables- it had a few stands of red peppers that was it. The sauce was nothing to write about- average Chicken fried rice: nothing special Chilean sea bass: cooked well- the sauce was good ( good umami) King prawns- it was okay.Overall I did not see anything special about this place , nor did the food warrant the price they were charging for each dish. Service was spotty: bt our waiter and the wait staff : disorganized. Made a mistake with our order. The other wait staff kept making mistakes and bring food or drinks to the wrong tables.

4.0,1/5/2017,"I have dined at Philippe in the past but with public figures down in the private cellar so of course nothing less than stellar service was provided. This week I made a dinner reservation to catch up with my friends, upon arrival the hostess informed me that our table will be ready in 10 minutes, no biggie, we went to the bar and grabbed some drinks there, the table was not ready in 10 minutes, it was ready after 30 mins. Our waiter Florin from Romania was delightful and pleasant from start to finish, he eased the tension we arrived to at the table for having to wait so long on a weekday and with a reservation. The lychee martini is my go to drink and personal fave, I tried Shanghai Philippe which is supposed to be champagne vodka and elder flower, but the taste was bland and the house champagne they use lacked in taste. Food was solid, we went with chicken satay, Beijing chicken, spicy mignon, tuna tartare ( off the menu special of the day) and fried rice and veggies. For dessert we ordered the new Instagram worthy cotton candy Alaska, whoever came up with this bravo!, the burnt pieces of cotton candy mesh well with the ice cream cake.  Overall I had a great experience at Philippe and happy that us regular people get the same service as celebs and known figures. However, they should manage reservations better Also, very interesting to see the dynamic between the upper east side society and the wannabe Instagram models who frequent the place with their louboutin soles and loud designer bags",1,3,0,Zulay A.,"New York, NY",198,117,3

3.0,12/26/2016,"To me, this place is all hype and that's it. When you're paying Philippe Chow prices for a dinner for two you would expect to have an over the top meal. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case when I dined here. To start, I ordered the Guns and Roses drink which was horrible (way too strong and bland). My bf went with a blue moon and that's standard so it was fine. For the appetizer, we went with the chicken Won Ton soup and I really wanted to like it but it lacked so much flavor. The soup tasted a bit watered down. I mean to be honest here, I've had better at local mom and pop take out place. We also ordered the chicken satay and again that was a miss for me. I wasn't a big fan of the peanut sauce for one and the meat wasn't satisfying. For the entree we ordered the shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. (Because by that time I didn't want to deal with anymore disappointment) I just wasn't a fan of this place at all. I will say the service was good, our waiter was very nice and pleasant so that's where the bulk of my three stars came from. Also,  the front door girls are extremely unwelcoming. You're covering a nice restaurant -- learn how to properly greet your guest and spend less time on your cell phone.

Dessert is never  worth it in an Asian restaurant.      Ambiance:We sat in what they call the runway room, and the floor was so sticky.  Disgusting to walk on.   Also, in general, the restaurant decor needs an update.  The furniture is tired and the design scheme is very ""last decade.""  You can live with it, but for the prices and image the restaurant is trying to project; it needs to be addressed.",0,0,0,Eric R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,11,0

2.0,8/12/2016,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a big fan of Mr. Chow but felt let down by this restaurant. The service was excellent and has a fitting ambiance for a high end Chinese food restaurant. However, the food was more like something you would get from PF Changs but at double the price. The crispy duck in the crispy duck salad was delicious (because when is crispy duck NOT delicious) but the bed of lettuce was mostly soggy iceberg with real greens of value peppered in with a lackluster dressing. The crispy beef was too heavily breaded and swimming in a sugary sauce lacking depth of flavor. I care a great deal for Chinese cuisine and the value of a dollar.

We hadn't ordered anything outrageous like the $75 Peking Duck or anything like that. We paid well over $600 for dinner there, for that disgusting experience. I will NEVER, EVER go back.

Our food sat at our table untouched. At no time did the manager of the restaraunt speak with us, rather he stood in the corner of the room where he whispered to our waiter and glared at our table. Needless to say, we had to get our check from a different waiter. I have never desired to leave a negative review for any buisness, but this will be the first.

There is a parking garage around the block that I parked in. $50 for the 35 min. Haha New York you're so silly, for real! This does not reflect my review just saying parking is near. So came in about ten minutes early and was greeted by the hostess. Waited about 5 min until our table was ready. The waiting area is a lounge and it's very comfortable. Escorted down to the back room. Great atmosphere. The decor is very elegant yet subtle. Classy. The tables are snug but bearable. The drink menu has plenty of options, pages and pages. The dinner menu is simple and self explanatory. Knew to try the chicken satay appetizer. After that we just winged it and ordered chicken and broccoli, chicken jo lau, and chicken fried rice. The chicken satay was out of this world. That peanut sauce that it comes with I can just eat with sown white rice. It's so creamy and rich it can be paired with something so simple and make it amazing. It really is his famous sauce. The chicken being orange gave me the impression that it would be seasoned but it wasn't that much. Not overpowering at all. It was delicious. Wish we just ordered a bunch of those with some rice. It would have been perfect. The main entrees were honestly not impressive at all. Could have been that we ordered the wrong things but to order three wrong things hmm. The chicken fried rice had no flavor at all. Even with the eggs and vegetables in it. Same with the chicken and broccoli. There is supposedly garlic sauce on it but didn't taste a thing. Yes it's great quality chicken. Not that paper thin chicken from the Chinese spots but no flavor at all. The chicken jo lau was a little bit better than the rest because the sauce tasted like a buttery garlic sauce. But it left a weird aftertaste flavor in our mouths like bitter garlic almost. At this point we were thinking we were just better off going to the corner Chinese spot. Also this place is inconsistent. Our dining experience was lovely. The service was on point. Attentive waiters who fill your water glass when almost empty. They clear the tables once done in a timely manner. We got our food in about 10 min after sitting down and ordering. Our reservation was at 4pm and we left the restaurant at 4:30pm. Sounds like we were being pigs but we just got our food super fast.

The incomparable Mr. Cheng also followed Philippe to his place, hand-pulling his famous noodles, which are a must-order.

Arriving before her, I sat at the beautifully appointed bar and sipped on a glass of perfectly chilled and fruit Pinot Grigio. (Admittedly, I wanted a cocktail, but $17 - $19 wasn't quite in the budget for a drink that night. Heh.) Once she arrived, we made out way to our table. There are various dining areas, with the front one being a little more boisterous, noise-wise, than the rear. Luckily, we snagged a quiet table for two in the far left corner of the rear room. Too bad I wasn't on a date with my beau, because it's quite romantic. ;-)Between the two of us, we split quite the feast! While at the bar, we both spotted a man with the chicken lettuce wraps and were trying not to drool. We ordered our own, along with the Crunch Duck Salad, which was delicious, though the dressing kind of pooled a bit at the bottom. But, going back to the chicken lettuce wraps, they were as heavenly as they looked! Honestly, after eating a few wraps, I didn't know how I'd manage our entrees. Still, we persevered! We split Chicken and Broccoli and the Crispy Duck with pancakes. The former was delicious, if not a tad bit bland; it could have used a touch more salt. The Crispy Duck with pancakes was perfection! Parts of the duck were so fried, it was almost like cracklings or chicharron. OH, I was in love! Served very simply with julienned cucumbers and green onions, hoisin sauce, and perfectly-sized pancakes, these made for an excellent entree. For dessert, we split a very simple Warm Apple Crumb Tarte with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Though seemingly out of place in a restaurant serving Beijing cuisine, I will eat ANY dessert that has apples. Ha! This was an excellent tart, so fresh that it was steaming when we cut into it.The service was top notch! Though it did take our waiter a little time to get to us, initially, I picked up on many instances of the staff's attentiveness. At the bar, my water was refilled without me asking, as as we dined, we got refills on lettuce wraps and hoisin sauce constantly, again, without ever having to ask. My mere complaint would be the bathroom. Located near the facade on East 60th Street, it was COLD in there. Brrrr! Not sure if there is a lot that can be done about that, however...In a city full of take-out joints and home-down Chinatown haunts, it's rare that I eat in a restaurant with Chinese cuisine that is so refined.

The ambiance was relaxing, with a cool bar area and couched seating in the front of the restaurant. The dining room was dimly lit which made for a nice atmosphere.We first started with a few appetizers. The chicken satay, which was prepared on a skewer, tasted amazing and was a great foreshadowing for the rest of the evening. They also served lettuce wraps filled with chicken that had a sweet sauce and spicy sauce, both hit the spot. Though skeptical about it when it was first served, the crispy seaweed was amazingly good with it's flaky texture, and sweet taste. The appetizers were finished up with vegetable, shrimp, and chicken dumplings that were so good, I couldn't choose which one to have so I had all three.The main dishes only cemented my feeling that Philippe Chow is not only one of the best chinese restaurants in New York, but one of the best restaurants period. The green prawns had a savory taste and did not have a fishy taste compared to other prawns I've had in the past.One of the real surprises was the Beijing chicken, I highly recommend this dish for anyone who loves hot or spicy food. The crispy beef was served as strips and had a delightfully tangy taste. My favorite entrée was the filet mignon with broccoli, with meat so tender it cut like a hot knife through butter.

5.0,2/5/2016,"I went to Philippe for a group dinner on a Monday night. I've been to plenty of Chinese restaurants, but none of them stood out as much as Philippe did. First of all the restaurant has a luxurious and elegant design, which creates a classy atmosphere. Second and most important, the food. As I came with a group, we decided to try-out most of the dishes together, since none of us has never been here before. The food isn't even close to something you'd find in Chinatown, despite the reviews I've read before going to this place. In my opinion the food served at Philippe was definitely from a higher standard. My most favorite dishes were the chicken satay, the crispy beef and the king prawns. I highly doubt I would find them anywhere in Chinatown just as good.Third of all the staff and drinks. As each part of the restaurant has its own waiters, the service is very efficient and professional. Never was there a moment when we ran out of food or drinks. The 'mixology' of the bar is something to recommend as well as they serve some very neat cocktails (in my case the Bangkok Banana and the Gun's and Roses).Overall Philippe was a very good (but expensive) experience which is definitely worth trying.

4.0,2/4/2016,"*This review is only for drinks and dishes at the bar*Upscale Chinese restaurant with a nice high-end bar area in the front.  Been coming here regularly over the past few years for after-work drinks, and finally decided to do a review.  Met some ex-coworkers here for drinks and food in the front bar area and as usual, the service and food are really good.  Technically they're not allowed to serve main dishes at the bar (only appetizers), however, they make a special exception for us, which is great.Cocktails are pretty good and they have a decent wine list as well, given that wine pairing with Chinese food is fairly hard to do, due to the soy flavors, spiciness, etc.  So, I was surprised and happy to see that they had JJ Prum on the menu, who is an excellent German producer of Riesling (off-dry), and it paired perfectly with the food.  At the bar, we shared these plates:Chicken Satay with Chef Chow's Famous Peanut Sauce- THIS DISH IS THE BOMB.  Whatever you do, ORDER THIS DISH, it's SIMPLY AMAZING.  Once again, if you only get one thing here, GET THE CHICKEN SATAY.  It's CRAZY CRAZY GOOD!  Like nothing you've ever had before.Mayonnaise Prawns with Candied Walnuts- This is the 2nd BEST DISH on the menu.  Also, make sure you order this.  Sounds strange to order a dish with mayonnaise on shrimp, but I assure you, YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID.Lettuce Wraps- they were fairly standard and nothing to write home about compared to the two dishes above.  I'd almost go as far to say that I enjoy the wraps at P.F. Changs better.  But oh well, you can't win them all.  Just stick with the Chicken Satay & the Mayonnaise Shrimp, that's all you need!Peking Duck Spring Rolls- were pretty good, but again, nothing to write home about.  I mean, they're fried spring rolls, and taste pretty standard across most Chinese restaurants.  Stick with the first two dishes I mentioned.So, I haven't had a sit-down meal here yet, but from those two awesome dishes above, you probably can't go wrong.  Just be aware that this isn't your run-of-the-mill Chinese spot.  It's high-end and attracts a business clientele along with a music industry (hip hop) clientele, which sounds odd...but we were here once when Jay Z & Beyonce were here, and, another time when Russell Simmons was here, so you get the idea.  Also a great place to grab a drink after-work, But as with most upscale spots in Midtown, it's not cheap, but worth it.  I recommend it.",9,3,7,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1010,377,1497

My second time here, I can say that its safe to order almost anything off the menu (still looking forward to trying a couple of things) A 100% satisfaction guaranteed. This is true fine Chinese dining. The interior is clean and chic. Dim lights set for a nice atmosphere and the music is low for a great conversation. Service is professional and does not nag you.

The first time I went here the bathrooms were a bit dirty and the air conditioner wasn't working. Our server was nice enough to give us a complementary drink and move us to a different dinning room with a working AC. The second time here the AC was working just fine and the bathrooms were clean, and every visit since. This leads me to believe that they truly listen to their patrons concerns.

4.0,2/2/2016,"Philippe is great! As soon as you arrive you realize you're in a New York hotspot with an extreme attention to detail. Right at the entrance you're welcomed by very kind members of the staff that take care of the coat check, and direct you through the bar to the restaurant. Philippe is really elegant and refined, everything immersed in a dim light that gives a relaxing vibe.I've tasted many items off the Menu and I must say that everything was excellent. My favourite course was the Shrimp Dumplings and the Beef Dumplings. Also the Beijing Chicken was very tasty. Impressive were also the Spring Rolls with Shrimp combined with the Drunken Sea Bass.I tried two different cocktails, Guns n' Roses, my favourite, and a very strong Lyche Martini.For dessert I chose a very tasty raspberry sorbet.

I can't say it was the best food I've ever tasted but I was satisfied and happy when I left. I started with the lychee martini- it was really good!! But I think every lychee martini I've ever had was pretty delicious and not as expensive. We ordered an extra appetizer: vegetable dumplings. They were decent but I wasn't in love. My appetizer was the chicken lettuce wraps. They were really good and filling! The sauce that came with it was really good as well. For my main course: crispy salmon. It was good but wasn't he best thing I ever tasted. Dessert was mango sorbet. I also tried the raspberry. Both were very tasty. I also had a coffee that was pretty strong! The service was great!

It sucks that we was stuck with this shit head as our waiter but we didn't let him ruin our night. YES! gratuity is automatically added, he knew he could act anyway and still get a good tip.

So yesterday a coworker and I finally went. It's a beautiful restaurant with lots of light and the servers were friendly. I started with the chicken lettuce wraps (which was basically a meal in itself). They were good and flavorful, but nothing more special than any other chicken lettuce wrap I've had before. I ended up taking half of it home since I knew I had a main course coming. My friend had the hot and sour soup--again a giant bowl--but it was too gelatinous for her and she only ended up having a couple bites. We each had the crispy salmon as our entree. I think we both agreed that it was good, but not great. I would expect something more creative than fried fish covered in sweet chili sauce and a bowl of white rice from a nice Chinese restaurant, but I guess that was asking too much.

This isn't an upscale restaurant, it is good food, again, but it on 60th street and you can walk in which you can't do at ""upscale"" restaurants. They should cater to the surroundings which would be the store and shop employees; after work crowds and walk ins, instead they try to appear that they are high end and sway the tables to give off that appearance as well. Now pay attention to what I am saying and next time you go in have a look. The back room we have for years called the ""racist room"" I won't get into more detail and it is a strong accusation but everyone knows it. If you have an urban look no matter your race, that's where you're going. To be arm and arm with the next table. I have witnessed them seating people and those people asking to be moved and them saying ""did you have a reservation"" it's horrible. I haven't gone back in a long time after a friend of mine had an incident coincidentally the same time frame as when reggae star movodo was put in the back room, told he couldn't take pictures then told ""sorry we didn't know who you were"" he called TMZ...get it together Philippe pay attention to the people who support you and stop pretending you're some fancy underground high class getaway.",0,0,0,Courtney R.,"Edgewater, NJ",29,34,30

Can you please bring Philippe to ATL please! Anyway, the wait staff is always super nice & i never have to wait to be seated which is a plus! I order the same thing every time I come.. Chicken satay or lettuce wraps for appetizer, bejing chicken for entree, and the sorbet for desert. Granted I know you can get the same meal at Mr. Chow and the new restaurant Red Stix but they don't compare to this place trust me! Don't believe the 3.5 stars this place is really good! Your check might be a little expensive but it's worth every penny. Only downfall is the parking! Street parking is never available when I come so I always have to park in the garage which ends up being pretty pricey once I leave. Oh and a quick tip...

5.0,11/18/2015,"I can't recall going to a fancy Chinese restaurant in the States, so I'll say Philippe was my first time I was willing to go for some fancy Chinese food. My friend recommended this place for peking duck so I tagged along. Great ambiance with dimmed lights and a narrow bar divided separately by a wall from the dining area. A lot of midtown working people were seated, not that many youngsters. The peking duck can be ordered for a portion size for 2-3 people, $75. My friend and I killed it. It was a lot of meat, especially after our shrimp dumpling appetizer (which I don't recommend because it was plain, but the green ""dough"" color was cool). However I couldn't stop stuffing my belly with the crispy, juicy duck meat melting away with the ""clean"" duck fat (if you know what I mean). It does take about 45 minutes for the meal to be prepared. I wish our waiter told us ahead about the waiting time because I was getting cranky, thinking he forgot our food.

3.0,8/18/2015,"This place has great food but the experience itself was more hyped up then anything. Everyone raves about this place in hopes of catching dinner with a celeb but as my first meal here, I wasn't that impressed. Went here for my boyfriends birthday and we were really fancy dressed because of how people talk about this place but when we got there , we quickly realised it wasn't upscale at all besides how nicely decked out it was. Not only was most of the customers dressed in basic jeans, tees and sneakers but even the waiters had on juice suits but sneakers on. (Bright orange at that)Very tacky. We were seated and attended to right away. The table next to us had about 6 guys that were yellin and cursing about sports and in a restaurant so ""upscale"" you would think a waiter wild ask them to lower their voice. But nope. We ordered the sesame chicken and the waited said we could have any rice we wanted (never mentioning there was an extra charge) so we chose lobster fried rice. I went to the restroom and it was a SINGLE room bathroom. Like one person at a time/ unisex restroom. Then I asked the waiter secretly if they did anything for birthdays . He says sure he can do something special with a red velvet cake. (Never mentioning there was an extra charge) dinner came and the food was AMAZING! Only thing that saved this rating. Afterwards the waiter came with the cake (literally as small as the palm of my hand) and it had like a sparkly fire thing in it. They sang and it was so cute. Loved that part. Then the bill came.... I was charged $23!!!! For lobster fries rice. And then charged $16 for that little palm sized velvet cake. now I'm not cheap by far but it's about the principle. If I would've known those charges ahead of time maybe I would've chosen a different rice or maybe not but the way they didn't even mention it like it was okay really turned me off.

We got a table and ended up next to a rowdy group which we handled quite graciously ( I might add). Needless to say, we went back to the bar so we could actually have a conversation and that's where our night turned good into a scene from ""what would you do"". The bartender overlooked us for a good 20 mins and we brought it to the attention of the manager named ""yoli"" (sp?) (name?). The bartender (youlie?)

Please know, however, that until u choose to acknowledge all paying customers as equal, I want no parts in the hype. I spoke again to the manager  (yoli) and he didn't care.

The service is pretty good and the waiters and hostesses do a great job of making you feel welcomed, but the owner and waiters will quickly let you know how important they perceive you to be by who they acknowledge in the room and how often they tend to you.

1.0,4/4/2015,The crazy thing is the food was amazing & the atmosphere was great BUT at the end of our meal we were told we had to pay the mandatory 20% gratuity for a party of three even though the menu said for 6 people! There reason behind it was because it was the holiday weekend(Easter) and worst of all because of TOURIST VISITING!!! I'm a little offended because I'm a tourist. My party planned to tip our waiter appropriately I just feel that getting hit with a mandatory gratuity and the end with was tacky and offensive.

The food was extremely bland and although everyone in my party tried a different dish, no one raved about any meal. It's a dark, romantic spot, but I wouldn't recommend it for celebrating a birthday because nothing special was done.

3.0,2/17/2015,"The restaurant is pretty - dark, comfortable, even romantic. The food is really good, maybe even excellent. The service is attentive. But something is missing. And I realize what it is.Almost all dishes are for at least two people (and prices therefore are double what the same items are at comparable restaurants}. The pricing didn't bother me, but it would be best to go there with parties of three or four or more. This is not a place for a solo.The chicken with lettuce packets is delicious, but for its huge size, it only comes with six small pieces of iceberg lettuce; when you are through with the lettuce, there is a huge mound of the diced chicken left over.  The chicken, hoisin sauce and lettuce are just put on the table.  The portion is huge and, although priced for two, could easily feed four - if you can get extra lettuce.  Because the tables are small, there is really no room to keep the plates once the next course is served.  This could be a problem if you want more of something.  The efficient wait staff will remove it unless you stop them.The Peking Duck is wonderful. It comes in two sizes. Small is good for two people. After it came, I realized what is wrong here. They serve the duck, wonderful 4"" pancakes which are really light and delicate, but way too small - they barely hold the scallions, hoisin and duck and so are messy to eat, hoisin and scallions, each on their own plate, but they do not offer to assemble, even the first piece. And I realized that the service is off - they are always there, but the wait staff doesn't do anything other than, take the order, put the plates down and clear. There is nothing wrong with the service,there just isn't enough of it. I even had to ask for a hot wet towel to wipe my hands.No fortune cookies or citrus here. It is beneath them.At about $100 a head, it is very expensive.

Sidebar: the server reeked of cigarettes/cigars. He did not make a suggestion or explain the menu. We ordered about 5 things on the menu and everything we ordered was bland. Our entree was the filet mignon and lobster. The steak was not cooked medium well like we asked, it was well done. Needless to say it lacked flavor and was dry and rubbery. The lobster had so much sauce on it it looked like it was just gooped on top and it totally overwhelmed the lobster. Our rice was lukewarm. Server never came to check on us. I was pretty forgiving because it was a Friday night but what really made me angry was that I made a note on my reservation that I was celebrating a birthday and an anniversary and requested a birthday candle dessert. It was completely ignored. We were handed our bill at the end our meal and that was all.

For appetizers we had dim sum, which was fairly small but delicious none the less. We both had alcoholic beverages which were nice and strong. For dinner we ordered fried rice with bits of chicken in it, the broccoli filet mignon and some kind of chicken with spicy sauce on it. We could've easily skipped on the chicken it wasn't anything special, but oh my the broccoli filet mignon was to die for ! It was soooo good I've never combined the two in my life with a spivey sauce like they did. I would only go back for the broccoli filet mignon because the portions were extremely small for a big price. Safe to say we cleaned out each plate and left nothing behind. Lastly, dessert was fantastic. It made the dinner complete. I had their chocolate fudge cake and an espresso shot which was actually huge. The cake was so delicious i thought about it for a week after.

Oh how wrong we were. We were extremely disappointed with the food. We all got the Prix Fixe menu--the chicken satay had a terrible flavor with a strange gravy sauce and the ""velvet chicken"" was in a bland, cornstarchy sauce. One of my coworkers got the salmon, which was not fresh and fried with a strange syrupy sauce. We thought at least the silver lining would be the sorbet--not so. 2 of my coworkers got the red grape sorbet, which was icy and unsatisfying--hardly the consistency sorbet should be.$30 total per person on this meal was not worth one dime. We could have gotten much higher quality food for about a third of the price. My coworker literally paid $30 for a plate of seaweed (she could not eat the salmon!).

1.0,8/19/2014,"I live in NYC and have been walking past this restaurant for years.  Finally decided to give it a try with some friends who were visiting. We had a mid-week reservation at 9:00. Open table showed all times available. Nevertheless, we waited 25 minutes to be seated. Once seated, we waited an eternity for a waiter to come to our table. Once he got to us he griped about how busy he was. Given that it was my first time at this restaurant, I asked if there were any house specials we should try. He pointed to the menu and told us everything was good. Thanks for the response, bud. The prices are astronomical. $65 for battered shrimp in honey vinegar sauce.  Good, but come on. $42 for chicken and broccoli for 2.  Sticky cold white rice comes with everything.  The same cloyingly sweet ""plum"" sauce is the accompaniment for the lettuce wraps and the Peking Duck rolls. For dessert,there is no menu. Instead,  they bring you 2 plates,each with a sign that says "" for display only"" containing old pieces of cake for you to see in case you didn't know what key lime pie or chocolate cake was. This place should be avoided. It is a pure tourist trap.",1,0,0,Westchester S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0
5.0,7/30/2014,"When you look at the other reviews you will notice other critics who rated this place either really high or those who gave it one star. This restaurant is in fact an overPriced Chinese spot, but, it's theMost amazing Chinese meal of your life! Brilliant just brilliant, you will never find food like this on that Chinese menu you have at home. Do yourself a favor and order the chicken satay! The filet mignon is mouth watering. Order any appetizers the spring rolls dumplings all are very tasty! The service is amazing; if you think you might feel out of place, don't worry, they have amazing customer service. This place is very upscale..you don't have to dress up but you could and you should. You can go in shorts and a polo shirt but you'll start questioning yourself when the guys in jackets and suits come and sit next to you. Enjoy simply amazing and food comes out real fast!

2.0,7/23/2014,"I really really wanted to like this place. I used to live in Miami and Philippe in South Beach was in my Top 3 to go to spots,  I went there at least once a week every week. This location is not even close to it service wise,  food wise and atmosphere wise. And I went there twice, thinking that my first time was just probably an off day for them. The only thing that saved it for me was chicken satay, even though it's not as amazing as in Miami location.I don't even know where to start. The most uncomfortable bar ever. To eat there you have to reach the plate with your face all the way, otherwise the food will be all over your clothes and I'm not exaggerating, there is no space at all for your legs and the only way you can actually seat is if you twist your lower body 90 degrees. If you have a purse or a bag - forget about it.Food. As I mentioned earlier, chicken satay is great.I have a sweet tooth and can handle any sweet sauce, you can even throw a pound of sugar on top of my meal and I will eat it. But their Crispy Beef was so insanely sweet I didn't even know it's possible. I couldn't finish 1/4 of my entrée without drinking 2 glasses of water and that's all I ate. And again it was my regular choice in Philippe South Beach. Service. Attentive. More on professional than friendly side, but still good.  One of the employees gave me attitude for no reason,  but we all have those days. Also for being $$$$ establishment the atmosphere was a little too casual. I felt like I'm in a $$ restaurant and the only thing (other than prices) that reminded me that it's $$$$ was waitstuff uniform.",2,0,0,Gia P.,"Manhattan, NY",193,26,7

I had heard so much about the Chicken Satay, it's over rated to me. The chicken is fine, the sauce... uhh, not so much. The chicken fried rice is a large amount and it was good. The Velvet chicken was good as well and the sorbet was excellent. I think it(lunch) comes with 1 flavor of sorbet but my server gave me an additional one, both were excellent. One was peach and the other was raspberry. The Velvet Chicken did not look nearly as good as it tasted. The service was excellent. I did not give it 5 stars because I believe my lunch came with an order of white rice and I believe it was just an oversight or it was purposely left off because my server was under the impression that I couldn't possibly want a container of chicken fried rice and an order of white rice. Boy was he wrong if that was the case, I wanted both. I did not mention it on account of the service was so good.

Yeah I know Tao is almost the same as this place but at Tao it feels like I'm going to a club with food. If that makes sense. I ordered the roast duck for 2.

You have to request it when making a reservation, although am warning the ladies you do have to walk down the stairs and past the kitchen to get to it, which is worth it only with a group. Stick to upstairs for a date.  I'm addicted to the chicken satay and the chicken lettuce wraps. That's usually all I order unless I'm in the mood for duck, in which case I get the duck salad. My husband also makes me split the Peking duck for 2, which is their specialty, and is great.. He enjoys the filet mignon as well.

I didn't like it, but ate more of it than I ate from my entree. 3) Velvet chicken. (disgusting pieces of questionable chicken with old vegetables). I HATE wasting food. I had to leave 3/4 of this behind. Just Nasty. 4) My friend had the sweet and sour salmon which was not fresh at all. The only good thing I can say is that we were seated fairly quickly after sitting at the bar. Keep in mind that it was a busy Saturday night and we came in after canceling our earlier reservation. The bartender screamed at my friend because of the tip. We paid for our food before we sat down to eat and he was worried we weren't going to leave a tip with the waiters. This is understandable, but he could have handled it better. The hallways and stairs are VERY narrow which makes it annoying to get to the bathroom or the bar without bumping into other patrons or waiters.

Luckily, the people sitting next to us were nice, because the tables are SO close you are practically sitting with your neighboring table.

For my main course, I ordered the vegetable lettuce wrap which I really enjoyed. My parents had the velvet chicken and the prawns in special sauce. My dad said the prawns were too sweet to his liking. He also asked to sub the white rice for brown rice and the waiter said that it was fine. Upon receiving our check, we notice two things. One, my dad received the wrong wine and was charged more than what he asked for and the brown rice was actually an additional $8 which we were not aware of.

2.0,12/2/2013,"I wasn't too thrilled with the food there, especially since it is expensive Chinese food. For starters the appetizers came out rather quickly, like 2 minutes too quick; seems like they have everything on hot plates which for me is a big no no for high end restaurants. If I'm paying premium price I'd expect my food made on the spot. For instance, we had the chicken satay, ribs, crispy seaweed, and the lettuce wraps. The crispy seaweed was rather interesting and the lettuce wrap & chicken satay were okay.  For our main course we had beef something, forgot what it was, and a 7lb duck with fried rice, they brought out the whole duck BUT they only leave you with the breast side, and to top it off it was really bland for a $60 duck. Service was good, although we had to flag our waiter at times, but I'm one of those that doesn't get bothered by those types of situations. I won't go back for the food, I rather spend $240 on a date at Blue Ribbon or Old Homestead. Overall, I enjoyed my time with my friends, it wasn't a bad experience.

2.0,11/3/2013,"I finally get why this place has a 3.5 star rating. So hear me out, the food here is legit. If I was basing this review on food alone I would give it a solid 4 stars. I went with three other people and we decided to order whatever it is that we wanted.  We started with lettuce wraps, spare ribs, chicken flat noodles, lobster spring rolls and the Philippe salad. Everything was delicious. The spare ribs were probably the best I have ever had. For main course we did red crab legs, crispy beef, peking duck, pork fried rice, bok choy and string beans. The crab legs were ridiculous in a buttery garlic sauce,  definitely a must try. The crispy beef was very crispy and maybe a little bit too fried for my liking. The peking duck is just ridiculous. The skin is crispy and golden brown and comes with pancakes to make little wraps. Just beware it takes about 45min to an hour to prepare so if you definitely want to try it order it as soon as you sit down.Okay so now I will tell you why Philippe gets 2 stars from me.... The service. It is below par and just plain terrible. I have been to the best restaurants in the city where they maybe have a right to be uptight and snooty and they aren't. I have never been treated worse than at this place. The waiter was so preoccupied with being a jerk that he totally messed up our order. For starters he was so nasty to us as we sat down and took so long to take our drink and food orders. As we place our dinner order, two of us ordered entrees and two were going to share the peking duck for an entry. We were told about the wait for the duck and agreed we had no problem with the wait. As the two normal entrees came out and we patiently waited for the duck, we asked about the duck and the waiter rudely told us "" I told you it would take 45 minutes."" At this point we are so sick of his attitude, my boyfriend finally snaps and asks why he didn't bring all the entrees out at once. The waiter was not expecting to be fed his own medicine and immediately changed his tune once my boyfriend put him in his place. The waiter was so focused on being nasty to us that he completely disregarded the fact that half of the table was going to be eating their entrees while the other half of the table was waiting for their duck. Then as half the table was done with their entrees they would have to sit and watch the other half eat their duck. In what way does that make sense?? But he didn't care. He was too worried about meeting his ""rude quota"" for the day. After my bf set him straight his attitude completely changed and he was kissing our butts for the remainder of the dinner.  This place has great food but its definitely passable due to the crap service. Try chin-chins on 48th for authentic & delicious chinese food, without the uptight attitude.",3,0,0,Nicole S.,"New York, NY",1,336,195

It helped a lot that they knew Spanish because they were able to explain some dishes a little better. My boyfriend and I shared the Chicken Wraps for appetizers and I must say it is definitely our favorite dish on the menu. For entrée my boyfriend had the Velvet Chicken which has a little spice to it so it gave the chicken an amazing taste. I had the Philippe's Surf & Turf and it was seriously some of the best Filet Mignon & lobster I've ever tasted. They were both cooked perfectly.

Painfully slow, wrong orders brought to table, charged double for some dishes, awkward serving timing. *$19 mixed drinks. I'm from Manhattan and I know all about the $15 drink but this is just ridiculous. It wasn't even great just good. *The $18 vegi spring rolls (3 per order) while they look ok on the outside when bitten into you see that there is like three strands of vegetables in the roll. So basically you pay $6 per roll for a won ton wrapper with two slivers of carrot in them. *The $29 half order of crispy salmon was overcooked with this odd orange colored sauce on it. The half order was about 3 inches square, for $29!*The decor is...well.. nonexistent. Bare eggshell colored walls. The no smoking sign was their only wall art. Very classy. *My girlfriend had the pork soup dumplings. I don't eat pork but she liked them. She really wanted the crab soup dumplings but they don't sell those anymore. *Vegetable fried rice had no vegetables in it and was greasy. *Sautéd vegetables were okay but could they give us less! The smallest plate I've ever seen but for like $25 what should I expect!*The shrimp toast was okay. Just okay. *No white rice with any of the food. Oh of course. You want it you have to pay. For white rice!*The restroom was like a gas station bathroom. So basically I paid $200 for some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.

If you do decide to go here choose your dishes wisely. It's a hit or miss menu and the menu states what dishes they are famous for. Consider those unless you want to be spontaneous.

5.0,12/7/2012,"I've eaten here about a dozen times or more. And this is the only place in Manhattan, scratch that, in the United States that I eat Peking duck. If you're expecting classic authentic Chinese food, don't even bother... unless of course you're here to eat the Peking duck. This is the best duck I've had in my lifetime of eating Peking ducks, and my Chinese father and mainland grandmother could attest to this as well. Their roasted ducks have the crispiest skin, yet they are not dripping with oil like other places. The pancakes that come with the duck are incredibly thin, and I can guarantee that you will eat more than 5 servings of this. I recommend that you only order appetizers and get the duck (it goes great with red wine). Their entrees are solid, but not as stellar as their Peking duck. Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth every bite. You can also ask to bring the rest of the duck home. Non-traditional Chinese appetizers that you should try:- chicken satay: they're infused with carrot and served with an addictive creamy sauce- spring rolls: get the vegetable, and eat all the crisp seaweed that is served with- shrimp toast: a guilty pleasure that is a mustTo everyone giving this place less than 3 stars, I don't know what you were expecting when you walked into a Chinese restaurant on the Upper East Side. Obviously it's going to be expensive, obviously it's going to be Americanized, and obviously the service is going to be slower than Chinatown. Set real expectations, guys. I come here to eat one thing only: Peking duck. Also, the decor may be plain, but for Chinese food, this is one of the more successful modern and upscale environments.Also, the Knicks dine here after games/practices regularly.

2.0,11/17/2012,"Honestly, it was overpriced Chinese food. Anyone who thinks different, must have this as their only Chinese food experience.I had the chicken Satay and the seven seasons prawns (big shrimp). The satay, which so many rave (and rant) about, didn't look natural or appealing. It was orange with brown sauce blobbed indiscriminately over it...it was nothing to write home about... The best thing on the menu was the broccoli, seriously. I have never had veggies sauteed like that. I could eat them all day and all night-but not for 10 bucks a plate.I ordered a ginger ale, and it tasted like seltzer, so the excuse was that the machine was acting up-so  was brought a coke in a glass bottle instead.The decor was plain to me. It was very sparse, simple with the tables placed really close together...The staff was ok; no one was mean, but they weren't nice either.The bathrooms were not usable, but then again  I have high bathroom standards so... Personally I don't want to understand how somewhere that charges 42 bucks for chicken can feel comfortable having bathrooms that rival that of a rural gas station...but whatever...I was disturbed that they differentiate between patrons; I don't know why some people get plain plates and others get the ones stamped with the name.

It's really because they wanted the OUTRAGEOUS $9 per glass of this pineapple juice. What should have been a $40 meal for two people at lunchtime was a few dollars short of $100.

A friend took me here to catch up on old times and I'd have to say i was impressed! We went into the cellar and i was even more impressed... we ordered drinks and didn't even look at the menu, we were on a mission and i knew exactly what i wanted. Waiter came over... we asked for the large lobster dish for two... here comes the kicker, NO LOBSTER! A unanimous ""WHAT??!?!?!?!"" came from the both of us? NO lobster? How do you have an establishment that advertises lobster like they do, splatter all over the menu, cooked in a variety of different ways, and tell us that they have no lobster? We were confused, hurt, heart broken and didn't understand. It seems nearly impossible for that to happen. With the amount of money they are charging for Chinese food (because that's exactly what it is, Chinese food!) they have the nerve to not offer everything on the menu. Sad and disappointed, we ordered the black bean bass dish and sweet and sour chicken with shrimp fried rice. It was good, but for a 90 something dollar tab, I was expecting more. And for a fraction of that price we could have gotten more food with more seasoning at Kum Kau And with the blow of not having lobster when I could already taste it in my mouth, everything else, of course, came up short.

The scallions were fresh and the they were fried perfectly. Very light, flaky, and delicious. My only complaint was the size. It was quite small. As an entree we shared the House Fillet. I love steak but I'm not the biggest fan of fillet Mignon as the meat is usually very tender but lacking in flavor. I'd rather eat a Bone In Prime Rib Eye. I am not sure what/if there was any aging on this fillet but it was DELICIOUS! Again, I'm not the biggest fan of fillet Mignon but I was pleasantly surprised.

1.0,11/27/2011,"I have no idea why people love the food here. Or maybe we just hit them on a very bad night. Price is not an issue for me, quality is. This place sad to say rates far worse than a high street fast food take out.I average eating out about 4 times a week, with that maybe every 4 months I may return a dish if its just no good. Otherwise I leave and move on. Life is too short to worry about one bad dish. I don't think I have ever returned more than one dish, however on my visit to Phillippe we returned 4 dishes, and would have probably returned more if we had simply not given up. I even had the manager taste our food and he completely agreed with some of the problems we had.Starting with the highly rated (overrated) Chicken Satay; I have never come across a breaded satay in my travels. Especially one that tastes like it has a McDonalds marinade. Truly a disaster. The Crispy Beef was over breaded and cooked in burnt oil. The pork dumplings - overcooked and tasted of old pork. The Peking Duck was greasy, the plate was covered with grease, the skin was not very crispy. Very average Peking Duck of a high street quality. I have no problem with a Greek run, Chinese cuisine, night scene. I do have a problem with a tourist trap, who highly dubious reviews. This may be a great night spot, but it would bomb quickly in London. I have no idea what the buzz is about, and I consider myself capable of hanging in the hippest clubs, and transitioning to a hole-in-the-wall when I want authentic cuisine.

2.0,11/24/2011,"Let's start off by stating the obvious. I cannot afford Philippe. I don't even have the $$$$ mark checked when I do Yelp searches. So clearly, I was not the one footing the bill on this one. I tried not to think, while sipping a $10 wonton soup and crunching on $32 shrimp skewers, the exorbitant amount of money spent on this night out.We came here for a family birthday dinner, so not only did I not pay, I never even saw a menu. All the restaurant specialties came pre-ordered. I left my vegetarianism at the door and tried almost everything.The aforementioned wonton soup was undrinkably salty. Like, if I had ordered in from Mee Noodle and they sent that, I would have diluted it with water and written a bad review. The chicken lettuce wraps were actually really good. I kept snacking on them the whole night while everything else let me down.The chicken satay didn't look or taste like chicken... the veggie dumplings were on par with the frozen kind you get at the grocery store (not the Asian grocery store, just the regular one)... the fried rice tasted like something you'd get at a cafeteria. My father-in-law complained that the crispy beef was going to give him diabetes. Overall, everything was OK for one or two bites, but after the whole feast I felt like I needed to flush out the MSG with a gallon of water, and I woke up the next morning thinking I'd slept in a desert.There are plenty of places in the city that I am sad I can't afford. Philippe is not one of them. I'm just as happy sitting in my PJs and eating delivery from Grand Sichuan (the one on 55th, yum...) as I would be spending $100 a person for spring rolls and satay.

2.0,11/2/2011,"I had heard many good things about Philippe, but I found the food to be sickeningly sweet.The chicken satay and lettuce wrap appetizers were tasty, but both rely on sugary sauces to punch up the flavor.  The satay comes with some sort of sweet cream sauce and the lettuce wraps are bland without the sweet hoisin sauce.  For main courses, my wife and I shared the teriyaki salmon and crispy beef.  Once again, the salmon was nothing special without the addition of the sweet sauce and the crispy beef, which is somehow my wife's favorite dish, had more deep fried batter than actual beef.  For a restaurant with this kind of reputation - not to mention prices - I was not impressed.",10,0,0,Michael S.,"Manhattan, NY",35,147,51

3.0,9/25/2011,"Ok so this place was okay. Attracts a good looking crowd of people however the wait staff were.. unfortunate in this area but whatever. They also weren't very friendly which made them even more.. hideous. The food however was much more promising but still underwhelming. We had the: 1) Chicken satay- For being famous for this particular dish, I found the chicken satay to be really mediocre. I can only imagine those who found this dish spectacular to be devoid of any taste buds because they were hardly anything to rave about. 2) Flat noodles- I didn't get to try these as I was rushing from work but my family really enjoyed this and went to say that these were the best noodles they've ever tasted. My family, for the exception for my dad, who happens to be Italian, is Asian so this is a pretty big deal. However, my dad who isn't big on Asian cuisine (ironic) said that this dish was the best thing he's ever tasted. Pretty bold statement. 3) Nine season spicy prawns- These were weird.. they were deep fried and then tossed in this strange sweet, sour, hardly spicy sauce. They were fine but the vinegar they used in the sauce made the dish taste like it was left out for a couple of days.. 4) Crispy beef- This had to be the strangest dish of the night for me. ""Beef"" stripes were dipped in some sort of batter and deep fried and tossed in a sauce comparable to the prawn dish. The beef though tasted to be like it was authentic Asian beef jerky that was deep fried. How I can best describe the taste or texture, rather, of this dish to you is to have you imagine stripes of cardboard that has been battered and fried and tossed in a sweet and sour sauce. My dad liked it though.. 5) Chicken and Broccoli- This dish was my favorite of the night. It was warm and delicious, not pretentious but rather simple and homey. However this isn't in a brown sauce that many of us order at the Chinese take out joint but in a tasty, velvety white sauce. I generally get my chicken and broccoli in a white sauce at the Chinese take out joint but it's usually in a more gelatinous, weird-textured white sauce which wasn't the case for Philippe's version. It was the best executed chicken and broccoli in white sauce that I've ever had. 6) Beijing chicken- This dish was liked by everyone at the table, including myself. The chicken was, again, also fried and tossed in a similar sauce to the beef and shrimp. However the meet was really moist especially for being cubed white meat chicken. It was good, I would compare it to a general tso's chicken but better executed and more refined. 7)Shrimp fried rice- The rice was disappointing especially for an upscale Chinese restaurant. Hello this should be the best tasting thing, right? Anyway aside from the fried rice being bland, the shrimp had a strange metallic taste to it, similar to the shrimp served at Bonefish Grill which I find to be so offensive. I share the same sentiment towards the shrimp at Philippe. 8) Chocolate cake and Red Velvet cake- Both were uninspiring and tasted as if prepared from a baker whose baking skills are rudimentary at best. The red velvet cake was very dry and if it wasn't for the cream cheese frosting, which was really good, it could be used as kindling. 9) Midnight Mojito- Meh, the drink looked great but tasted far from it. Every sip was more disappointing than enjoyable. But again, it looked fantastic but I wish it also tasted fantastic. So basically, if you want to know the truth i think it's an experience everyone should try but it isn't a cheap experience either. For seven people the bill came out to be about $800. By no means though is this place authentic Chinese cuisine. My poor Asian mother was such a trooper sitting through this meal eating food that she herself knows isn't authentic. But again, my dad loved this place and he doesn't prefer Asian cuisine generally. However, the highlight of the night was my mother asking to wrap up the leftovers so that she can give it to the homeless man down the block.. That's my mom.. giving Philippes to the homeless. So to conclude, would I go again? Sure. Am I dreaming of this place? Definitely not. I think though I'm going to try Mr. Chow's next.",0,1,0,Kevin T.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

2.0,8/13/2011,"I had such high expectations for Philippe. The service lives up to expectations but I've had better food at less fancy Chinese resturaunts. At Phillippe I had the recommended Chicken Satay. A slice of chicken the color of tandoori was swimming in white buttery sauce. The sauce was slightly sweet with a subtle a maple syrup taste. This is something I hope never to have again. (my bias is that I hate butter based sauces and that I was fantasizing about a satay with more of a barbequed flavor and char.)I also had the spicy and sweet prawns. These were breaded - which I wish was indicated in the menu - and covered in sweet spicy sauce as promised. The prawns were large and the breading was still crunchy. This dish was ok - but nothing worth paying $32 for.

3.0,7/28/2011,"I have two totally opposite experiences of Phillipe but they both deserve 3 stars so it works out fine. Phillipe offers a $20 prix fixe lunch which really is a good deal. The go-to appetizer is the chicken satay which is basically soft chicken on a skewer covered in this sweet/buttery sauce. Its delicious but very unhealthy, like most of the items on the menu.  The lunch scene is very quiet, usually just a handful of tables taken and they really only make money on the lunches if you buy drinks which are really expensive. The other night I came here on a Saturday around 9 PM for dinner. What a totally different scene! It seemed like a mix of snobby locals, eurotrash and long islanders who are looking for a trendy dinner scene. The food is mediocre and the prices are really, really, high. The food tastes good but its mostly sweet, salty, fried, etc... creating flavor in all the wrong ways. The drinks were also $15+ each, which kills the bill.I'd say try it once for the lunch special if you aren't health-conscious but expect to be disappointed if you come here on a weekend night and aren't into seeing and being seen and overspending on mediocre food and drink.",1,3,1,russell b.,"New York, NY",37,116,0

That sums it up.Yes probably not the most authentic, but then again Philippe does not strike me as a common chinese name.We had a feast. We had the private dining room and endless courses came to our table. I felt the pressure of chopstick operation, whilst I have a good working knowledge of how to eat with them, sitting next to Chris and Q, I felt scrutinized, the critical eye looking over me, to determine if I am proficient....or at least sufficiently proficient. The easy and medium items are a no brainer, but items like the salad wraps (the chopped chicken and vegetables are really diced very small), the skwers of prawns.... generally I wanted to pass the test of abandonment of the fork and knive. I did not pass. As I look at my plate, I realize that both fork and knive are sitting on it, dirty. When did I use them! F*, I didn't even realize!So moving on. Starters, mains, mains, mains, duck, desserts. Too much food. I skipped breakfast and lunch on friday...started feeling pekish at 3pm. God, I just realized this may be a great pre yom kippur option if it takes me to 3pm! I liked the salad wraps, spring rolls and dumplings. Loved the Beijing chicken and green prawns. Was actually just ok with the satays. Was not really sure if they are the Nicks sponsors and inherit the team colors, plus they had a buttery French sauce, definitely more Philippe than Chow.The Peking Duck? By the time the whole duck was sliced, passed around the table, a piece of skin with a miniature piece of meat was left. So I had a vegetarian roll, with a hint of duck. The Beef. definitely not Chinese. Q said, ""chiniese beef is no good, this is good, this is american, I am glad!""Deserts: The Creme Brulee, a clear chinese favorite, was tasty but crust-less, that's just not good enough! With Creme Brulee, such a classic its all or nothing, there's no compromise. Here it should be nothing.As we left the dining room, we realized that the restaurant is actually quite buzzing, modern cool setting, completely different magnetosphere, kind of cool.Oh and I just looked at the menu online to remind me of the dish names.

Know- Some of their more expensive wines are fairly priced and pair up great with the pekingnessKnow- the soup dumplings are nothing compared to chinatown but you shouldn't need me to tell you thisKnow- you may be surrounded by celebs or wall streeters or persian royalty or long island princesses or the cast of jersey shore. Chances are they dont like you either. Just realize you are in a famous and expensive restaurant. people come for all sorts of reasons and have a right to be there.

About 3-4 girls working the door. As soon as we checked in, the girl made a note of it on the computer and started writing a physical description of me ... RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I know it's busy and I know it's hard to keep track of everyone, but don't make me feel like you intently observed what I look like, what I am wearing etc., within our 30 second interaction.We were seated (an hour past our reservation and after pestering the girls). In the interim, I was smacked in the face by about 30 Chanel bags, shoved by 18 girls from Valley Stream and not once did I hear the words ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry.""Our table was next to a large (think 20+) crowd of B+T, dancing on the table, taking shots, screaming. I know it's New Years, but I decided to go to Philippe b/c I didn't want to go to some club. The food was phenomenal, what we tried. As soon as we finished our entrees, a bill was dropped and we never saw our waiter again. It's funny because we wanted dessert and coffee. I suppose since they didn't seat us till 11:30, they assumed that they could just kick us out of our table. Keep in mind, all the tables were full. It wasn't as if they closed the kitchen. They were operating with delays, not us. Here's the bottom line: food is good, service is terrible, crowd is lame. Order take-out or go on a dead night.",1,1,1,Miss M.,"New York, NY",58,150,0

Our upstairs space, however, did allow us to concentrate fully on the amazing food.Chicken Satay - the best I have ever had, nothing else comes close. The cream satay sauce is to die for. We asked for extra and dipped our broccoli in it.Mixed dumplings - this was decent, though about the same as dumplings elsewhere. Broccoli- perfect and flavorful, though we couldn't resist using it as a vehicle for more Satay sauce.The bartender was super friendly and very attentive, as were all the servers who brought our food and such.

3.0,11/5/2010,"3.5 stars I guess.  I have very mixed feeling about this place.  The food ranged from bad to excellent with a few dishes right in the middle, the portion size was alright, the service and ambience were excellent, but the value is terrible.  Our drinks were $15 which is just about the most I'd ever pay for a drink (not made with liquid gold), mine in particular a type of blueberry mojito was excellent, but not very large for the price, again not a good value.  We were seated in the back room, a bit closer to the tables next to us that I would have liked, I think they should take out 2 tables and give people a bit more room.  We had a 6:00 reservation and they seated us right away, but the food also came out very fast, perhaps too fast.  Service as I said was excellent, friends, attentive, informative, he helped us decide what to order, although he seemed to suggest mid-meal entrees followed by our real entrée which was a bit weird, and a reflection of how much money they want you to spend here.  For the most part the crowd was well dressed, very fancy.  I'm not sure if this place is popular because of the quality of the food/environment, or because its fancy and expensive.  To be honest the crowd was a bit too polished for my taste, a bit phony.  Onto the food, the chicken lettuce wraps were good, not great, not memorable.  The chicken satay was amazing, best part of the meal.  The 'famous cream sauce' was legitimately one of the best sauces I've ever had!  I wanted to ask for a straw, it was amazing and the rest of the table felt the same way.  The hot and sour soup was good, above average, but for $10 I'd say it was a real rip off.  The Salt and Pepper Calamari was very good, but not better than I've had at other much less expensive places (see my Fat Buddha review).  It was also a bit small for the price (around $14), for inexpensive ingredients, I expected a much bigger portion.  It also did not come with a sauce, which I thought was strange, although there were already a few tasty sauces on the table including hoisin, and a fantastic hot sauce that was not to spicy.  Onto the main dishes and I must say they were disappointing.  We had the 7 pound duck, which sounds like it would be quite big but in reality, 3 of us devoured it and were still hungry.  The 'homemade' pancakes were OK, a bit think and flat, I like the thicker fluffy version, authentic or not.  The duck itself was good, but aside from being small, it had a lot of fat on it.  Now I know duck fat is amazing, so I did not mind THAT much, but my company did, and spoke about other places that trim the fat between the skin and the meat before presenting the duck.  The skin itself was good and crispy, but not overly so.  Overall, good duck, very tasty, but for $75 it was expensive, I think it serves 2 people, maybe more if you order a lot more food.  The halibut in a sorta sweat and sour sauce was passable, not very good.  The mild fish was totally overpowered by the sauce, not impressed.  Also one martini was all vermouth and was hardly drinkable.  My desert was terrible, I should have sent it back.  COLD apple tart, which crumbled when I touched it, toped with cold boring ice cream.  Over all, some food was memorable, some was decent, nothing was terrible aside from the desert, which by the way was in no way Chinese....  I would not recommend this place for value alone, it was $300 for 4 people not including the drinks at the bar ($30).  Pass on this place, unless you order the satay in bulk, and dont mind an overpriced but good duck.",0,0,0,David S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",439,258,302

We walked up to Philipe and I thought, ""French is a far cry from Chinese but if you say it's out of this world snookums, I'll take your word for it."" We stepped out of the unseasonably steamy NYC night into the ever-so-cool Philipe and as I absorbed the chic decor and beautiful crowd, I was informed they serve Chinese food. Nice!Sweetie and the host quietly collabo'd for a few seconds then a pretty blonde whispered, ""Follow me."" As I tried not to bust my ass climbing down the steep stairs in my 5 inchers, I wondered where the hell we were going. We weaved through the kitchen and another area that looked like the boiler room in Nightmare On Elm Street, before we were lead into a tiny, dimly lit room--the Wine Cellar. There was a large party seated with an elderly man at the head of the table regaling the guests with bottles of wine, platters of food and one of those ""Well in MY day stories."" I honestly thought we walked into a powerful crime family's private dinner and were going to get whacked if we overheard too much information. Obviously the pretty blonde thought the same thing because she quickly ushered us into the adjacent cellar which was much larger and not as intimidating. There were only three other people seated so we basically had our run of the joint. Club music played softly in the background, an NBA game was playing on a 50 inch plasma and hundreds of bottles of wine stared at us as we prepared to get our grub on. As I took in my surroundings, I thought of Edgar Allen Poe's dark thriller, A Casque of Amontillado. I figured I needed to be on my best behavior so my guy wouldn't get me drunk, shackle me to the wall and bury me alive when the other guests left.Ok now on to the food...de-EFFING-licious! I'll just make a quick list and check it twice to be sure I got everything:   Wonton Soup  Chicken Satay  Wok fried mayonnaise prawns  Crispy seaweed  Jade dumplings  Drunken sea bass  Pink prawnsWe did a good job of cleaning our plates until we got to the sea bass. As scrumptious as it was, there was just no more room. In between bites, I sipped Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc while my honey downed vodka tonics.

3.0,2/14/2010,"Ok, it's not Philippe's fault that I generally do not like upscale Chinese food, hence the 3 stars.   I really don't, I usually always feel ripped off.  Yes, you get way better ambiance, and don't have to trek down to Chinatown, and it's safe to say that you get MSG free food but whether that's worth a $200 price tag is debatable. However, this place is cute.  It seems to have a decent bar scene, and enjoyable ambiance-- romantic, although I came here with my family for Chinese New Year.  The service is very attentive; they're always changing your plates, refilling your water-- and I didn't think they were pushy.   Onto the food, accordingly to my sister (who picked this place), her friends from Beijing just RAVE about the Peking Duck,  Surprisingly, there isn't that much selection in the city to having Peking Duck.  The other famous place (located in Midtown and C-town) is the Peking Duck House, which was more traditional-style.   The quantity is smaller at Philippe but I do think that it's juicier;  the pancakes were very thin and enjoyable to eat (very light and wispy-- they'll give you more if you ask for it too, free of charge).  And the scallions and oyster sauce is pretty standard.   The Duck is good here, so I'd recommend that for $75-- it really does feed you a long way.  Only con is that, the skin could have been crispier.   Other items we ordered: the black bean miso Chilean sea bass-- this was good!  A lot of times ordering this at a local Chinese spot, comes out fishy tasting.  It tasted fresher here, and the black bean miso atop was excellent!   We also ordered the string beans, and they were forgettable-- upon recommendation for this dish, I thought they'd be prepared with chili but they just came out greasy.  Not worth $10.  We had the Chicken Satay appetizer, (which by the way is $18 for 3 pieces!!!)-- though the red/orange color is kind of sketchy looking, these were so delicious!   As my fellow Yelpers have pointed out, the satay sauce is true heaven.  I should have asked what it was made of but they key ingredient here seemed:  butter, butter, butter!  Very untraditional for the Chinese, but I ain't complaining, this order is a must!  The last thing we had (actually the first-- sorry this review is going backwards),  we started off with the Chicken Lettuce wraps.  These were good, healthy appetizers to start off-- I liked freshness of the lettuce, and the ground chicken mix wasn't too greasy (could had had more diced veggies though-- and peanuts would have been a good addition)  We skipped out on the desserts because we were too stuffed; I would have liked to see more Chinese-inspired desserts (granted I actually don't really like Chinese desserts), but something like a sponge cake, or sesame infused SOMETHING would have reminded me we were having Chinese cuisine.   There is plenty of good non Chinese selection though;  the desserts are a good size and they bring out live samples for you, versus seeing it on a menu.  I would have bet that Red Velvet Cake would have been DELISH (cake, not cupcake!) as well as that French coconut Napoleon.I guess what I also missed the most is the SPICE! Granted peking duck (which is the main event at Philippe) is a Northern Chinese (Beijing) speciality, where the cuisine isn't known for its spice.  That would explain the weak chili sauce.  I'd say that if you have to go to fancy Chinese, you can give it a go here.  In retrospect, I did think the duck was better than Peking Duck House but I would still rather just have a simple meal in Chinatown or Flushing-- even if the duck and chicken is headless, hanging upside down ominously at you from the window.  It would leave less of a pain in your pocket-- and for the fancy decor, just have a French meal where that's better appreciated.",4,1,1,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

The Chilean seabass was served simply- a standard dish without any twists. The waiter was pushing the house filet which turned out to be mediocre... I should have figured that a Chinese fusion place would not be too good with steak. On the other hand  the overpriced side order of seaweed was really good seaweed!The cocktail list is very alluring and I was excited about my Golden Grape which turned out to be a glass of champagne with two grapes on the bottom and not the ""muddled grapes/Ciroc vodka/elderflower cordial finished with champagne and frozen grape garnish"" that was described on the menu.

For the entrees we got a chicken dish and the green shrimp.  Both dishes were extremely slimy, no different than what you'd get if you order in from a chinese place that is is just about to close.  The green shrimp tasted like soap.  Everything was underseasoned (no remnants of real Chinese flavors) and overpriced.  Except...The duck was very nice and certainly in my top 10 Peking duck experiences.",0,0,0,Julian M.,"Northwest Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA",33,53,0

We were told it was be just a minute so we headed to the bar for a drink. While waiting for our table, we watched the maître d' be unbelievably rude to a customer. Apparently he had forgotten to give them their takeout order while it sat on the floor for over thirty minutes and they sat at a table waiting for it. When the customer asked him why he let it sit for so long the maître d' replied, ""I am human just like you."" Never did he apologize. I looked at my boyfriend and said, ""that guy is a pompous ass."" We waited for over thirty minutes before asking him what was taking so long he replied, ""Your table is ready now."" Right, but you didn't answer our question. When we asked again what took so long he told us, ""we were waiting for your table to clear."" Now maybe he thought we really were that stupid and were going to fall for that. No one left in the time we sat waiting, and when we were brought upstairs over half the dining room was empty. I was so angry and annoyed at the arrogance we asked to speak to a manager. The manager was very apologetic and covered our drinks for the rest of the night. Unfortunately, I was too tainted from the little jerk downstairs. It really is unfortunate because the food is amazing. The chicken satay is like crack...I swear I could eat it every meal every day. I don't mind paying out of my butt for food if it is good, but when the first person you meet is a prick, it is hard to overcome.

3.0,1/29/2008,"Overall: 3 Stars. Let's see... The last time I had ritzy-titsy chinese food? Oh, right. It was Jean George Vongrichten's  now defunct 66. Philosophically, I have big beef with expensive, white-man-adapted ethnic restaurants in general, and Philippe is d$%n expensive at $100+/head for 5 hungry guys looking to throw down a couple cocktails and some dinner. Having said that... This was, with several exceptions, THE best overpriced, ritzy-titsy chinese food I have had. Chicken satay, the omnipresent and often bastardized poultry and peanut sauce appetizer of oh so many bar mitzvahs and weddings, was very tasty: hammered thin and smothered in its viscous glaze. While the spring rolls, lettuce vegetable wraps, and chow fun (ordered for the vegetarian at the table) were mediocre and utterly forgettable, the sliced drunken seabass and seabass with black bean and garlic - while probably not from a sustainable source (SHAME) - were sublime: fresh, perfectly balanced flavors without the apprehension one usually has while eating a whole fish and worrying about your mouth inevitably being stabbed by a rampant bone. Combining sweet, savory, and nutty flavors, the ""Beijing Chicken"" wins best poultry entree in a supporting role. Last to be served and less than impressive was the crispy beef, or as I affectionately referred to it, the organge chicken fried steak, which resembled and tasted more like citrus-flavored jerky strips than anything else. Philippe's boasts quite the selection of desserts for the sweet tooth out there, but we ended up splitting an assortment of 5 sorbets: blood orange, lemon, lime, melon, mango. Flavors were bright and pronounce like they should be in good, fresh sorbet. The scene is a mix of ballers - thanks to constant plugs from Hot 97 I'm told - and the Sex-and-the-City set that I am sure frequented, and probably still frequents, Tao, D. Burke & Donatella, Geisha, and the rest of the UES restaurant circuit. If I were to go back, I'd scale the meal back to the Beijing Chicken, Drunken Sea Bass, and the sorbets.

The chicken satay was unique, and the shrimp rolls and lobster roll were packed with moist flavor (hint, there's a lot of corn starch a mixin', gotta love corn starch).
