5.0,4/20/2019,Great pre-theater meal. Pricey but delicious. We did the pre-fixe menu which I was surprised to find lets you select anything from the menu. A few with a supplemental charge. I would definitely go back.,0,0,0,T R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,18,4
3.0,4/14/2019,"I enjoyed this restaurant, but was really expecting a little more out of a DB venue.  First off, I must say, the service was amazing!  Top notch!  We came before a show and ordered the pre fixe. The food was good...not memorably great. I had a beet salad which was average and scallops as my main. There was nothing really memorable about the scallops either.  For desert we had a special, it was a lemon desert w meringue.  A little too sweet for my likings.  I would try this restaurant again and order totally different next time.",0,0,0,Christine G.,"Melville, NY",25,78,17

5.0,3/10/2019,"We ate a late lunch/early dinner on 03/04. The restaurant was basically empty at that hour. Even though they were setting up for a huge number of reservations later, it was kind of a plus for us. Very quiet after a hectic morning and tons of very personal service. It is a beautiful restaurant, full of wonderful art. My friend and I had the appetizer, entree and dessert $33 deal. My friend had onion soup and coq a vin. She finished with creme brûlée.

4.0,3/2/2019,I was going to give 5 stars despite ordering an item and never receiving it....but then I got my bill. The food was great and service was poor.  I told myself I was going to give 5 stars anyway because I thought I would definitely come back here.  The pate was amazing and imaginative. Everything I ate was great. I tried the burger because it seemed interesting and it was. I got my bill and was charged 12$ for a diet soda and a refil.

Had a great meal post-Network here last night. Made a reservation but didn't need one for 9:30 on a Thur night. The wines by the glass are very expensive, but dig into the wine list and you can get a bottle for $55 - totally reasonable and good. The food and service was superb.

5.0,2/16/2019,"I truly think 5 stars is not enough for DB Bistro Moderne - what an absolute treat this restaurant is!The noise level is very low, the food is superb, and the decor is nicely done. This was by far the best service I've had while dining out in NYC - DB easily ties for the best restaurant I've dined at for date night. Everyone had a smile on their face and a genuine interest in not only our plans for the evening but also in our meal. We came here 2 hours before our show on a moderately busy night with no reservations. Fortunately we were seated at the communal table with only one other party. Escargot Persillade 5/5Perfect appetizer for two - the almond-herb butter was spectacular. I'm not a fan of snails but I could order this every time. Poulet Rôti 5/5I haven't had chicken this delicious in quite some time. The sunchokes were my favorite part of this dish. Magret de Canard a l'Orange 7/5Yes, that's a 7 out of 5. I could not have expected this fantastic of a meal. When I dine here in the future, I will face the dilemma of ordering this once more or trying something new. I cannot complement the chef enough. The orange & ginger glaze is what sold me on trying this and it truly made the meal. Brussels Sprout 4/5Simple, tasteful. Enough to share and won't disappoint. Mushroom Fricassée 4/5As like the Brussels Sprouts, simple yet tasteful. Great to add to our meals, especially with the Poulet Rôti.",1,0,0,Stephen M.,"Pensacola, FL",28,25,32
4.0,2/16/2019,"DB Bistro Moderne is a fine establishment. The servers are conscientious, the food is delicious and the decor is contemporary while being classic. The prices are on the high side but the experience makes it worth it. Ordered:Tarte flambe ($15)- what could be bad about bacon, onions and fromage blanc on a thin crust? The answer: absolutely nothing! It's simple and good. Baby gem salad ($14)- this salad was made with fresh lettuce, tart grapefruit and an anchovy and herb dressing. The dressing had a complex umami flavor that was divine. I really enjoyed this. Dover sole meunière ($55)- I splurged on this entree and it was worth it! I know, more than fifty bucks for fish sounds crazy. The sole was mild, was lightly browned and was paired with the most delectable sauce made from butter, capers and croutons (they stayed crispy). I squeezed some lemon on top. It was one of the best fish entrees I've had in a while. I also recommend the fingerling potatoes. You might want to drench them in that sauce.Molten chocolate fondant ($14)- this was a chocolate lava cake. It was definitely decadent. It came with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a mini scoop of dark chocolate sorbet. They were served elegantly which I appreciated but a part of me was longing for a big scoop of vanilla ice cream to enjoy with the rich cake.",1,1,0,Ally R.,"New York, NY",13,87,106

We pick and chose between the pre-fixe, appetizers and entrees and ended up with the Bacon, onion flatbread, the mushroom soup, the lamb shank and the beet salad. The mushroom soup was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Easily the best my friend and I have EVER had and we LOVE mushrooms. The lamb shank melted in our mouth. The wines were reasonably priced and we ended up with a delicious Reisling.

4.0,1/21/2019,"The restaurant ( our second visit) is lovely. Serene, pleasantly lit and not too big. While service is impeccable and the varied menu of mainly slightly French fare is good, I must admit...Sunday evening after a show with my wife we had a reservation at 5P. We entered the restaurant around 4:40P and like others who were ""post theatre"" waited at a communal table without any offer of appetizer or drink!? Does Chef Boulud know this?When seated, our server Jose was most attentive and informative. I must admit, the $35 burger (considered a house specialty) is small and does not transcend in taste orDepth as a juicy, terrific burger at all. Yes, even with a morsel of fois gras tucked inside. French fries were average at best.The gem salad was much more hearty and tasty to be honest.If there is a next time, I will re-order the coq au vin.Tip for management, ensure your tables for two are not too close to tables of four as last night it felt as if we were shoulder to shoulder with another table.",0,0,0,Marc W.,"Great Neck, NY",82,64,3
4.0,1/20/2019,"We went here last week pre-theater, always a challenge as the restaurants in the theater district are known for mediocrity and sullen service. The bistro staff were efficient and friendly. The wine list was fabulous and our wine paired well with the coq au vin, which was as good as I can make at home. That is high praise because I make a mean coq au vin! We had a lovely dessert that paired grapefruit with earl grey ice cream that was not too sweet or cloying. All in all a success and highly recommend.",1,0,0,Wanda M.,"New Hope, PA",0,68,0

2.0,12/15/2018,"I walked into this place with high expectations but also a lot of good will and charity since I'm a ""glass half full"" and ""think about what's good, not what's bad"" type guy. I walked out, however, furious at what was obviously just a cheap and cynical exercise in celebrity chef branding.Backstory: DB Bistro Moderne is the brainchild of Daniel Boulud, of ""Daniel"" and ""Cafe Boulud"" fame (narcissistic naming much)? db (get it?) bistro moderne is one of his more recent offerings and attempts to fuse the high-end diner with the French bistro.My friends Joy M. and her perpetually grumpy sister ""H0pe"" were coming in to town to see the Met exhibit on the ""problematic"" painter Delacroix, so I joined them for a meal before we all went to the museum afterwards. Joy immediately had words for the furniture, which she found cheap for a place that shifts a large part of internal decor costs to the menu. (""Those tables look like they are from Ikea"" -- quotation from Joy.) For appetizers, we had a pastry basket, which was acceptable but not transcendent, and flambee (cheese on bread), which was pretty good. Main event for me, though, was the infamous $35 burger, and for that price, you bet your damn life that I was using Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger as a rubric. The db bistro moderne twist on the dish is to stuff the patties with braised short rib and create the feel of overpowering meat consumption. Unfortunately, it comes out really dry and overcooked, and I had to push myself to finish the thing. ""You aren't eating your burger, Merlin,"" said Joy. I didn't say anything to avoid spoiling the mood.Would db bistro moderne have the foot traffic it did if it were called hm bistro moderne (Hope M. bistro moderne)? It's doubtful. This is all about branding and hoodwinking, and we all agreed we should have known better.",0,0,0,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",274,608,74
3.0,12/6/2018,"Average. The celery soup and salad was terrific but, the entrees were very average. The coq au vin was a dark, stewed chicken and the cod was only ok.  This is a pricey restaurant and we expected more.",0,0,0,Anne P.,"Malibu, CA",0,29,0
4.0,11/29/2018,"I really liked DB's Bistro. However, I was a bit disappointed by the DB Bistro hamburger, because I had high expectations. Given the price, I thought the sides were very small portions. First, I had a pumpkin soup which was to die for. Smooth, thick, rich and creamy. Really good! I ate every bite. I enjoyed the amuse-bouches which were pickles, and dried meat. The bread was ok, not great. As a main course I had the burger. It was interesting, but not spectacular. I didn't taste the foie gras very much. The fries were good, I'd say they were even better than the mushroom or green beans sides. The burger was a bit difficult to eat because so big, but I was expecting a little more ""wow"". I would definitely recommend the sole, which was really well cooked. The butter that accompanied it was extremely rich. I wasn't very impressed by the mushrooms, or green beans. As a dessert, I definitely recommend the madeleines. They are a perfect dessert to share with the table, they come out warm, fresh, soft to chew, and are small, so you will enjoy them, even if you're full from dinner. The ambiance is very calming, with dim lights and excellent service, even though the tables are quite close to each other. Food is superior to anything in the neighborhood, so I would go back.",0,0,0,Anna P.,"Durham, NC",2,77,352

2.0,9/16/2018,"So disappointed - it's been a few years since we'd enjoyed a wonderful dinner. Came for brunch - a little early for our reservation. Only a few other couples (seriously, only about 3 other couples max) here for brunch at 10 am. But they seat us at a tiny table for 2. and there are several other larger tables available. During the entire hour we're there, only one other party arrives. So clearly, there was room to put us at a larger table. We ordered the french toast, side order of sausage, and The New Yorker (bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese). They offer you choice of plain, sesame or ""everything"" bagel. I order the sesame bagel. The server comes back and apologizes that the sesame bagel is unavailable. Really??! It's Sunday brunch (10am!!) in NYC and you only have plain or ""everything"" bagel? You can't find any other bagels in NYC? It's not like these are awesome bagels either. The plain bagel is good, but seriously, I had an awesome bagel at Zucker's deli and they're not even the best place in town. The smoked salmon is good, but again, not anything special. This is DB - isn't everything supposed to be amazing?? I'm seriously disappointed. The french toast is a beautiful thick cut slice of brioche type bread, but while I don't like french toast dry or overcooked, this is slightly too moist in the inside. The sausages look good, but they don't taste fresh and juicy - slightly off. I don't mind splurging for an exceptionally prepared meal, but this was very mediocre and not worth it.",0,0,0,Cynthia A.,"Malibu, CA",9,173,163

I ordered the flambee and it was a glorified flat bread with tiny pieces of bacon. I'd, honestly, rather have a flatbread pizza from Dominos. My boyfriend had the burger and my grandma had the French toast. The French toast was the only decent dish.

The foie gras burger is a hefty $35 so definitely not an everyday burger (which should totally be a thing) but instead a nice, occasional treat. There is a more than adequate amount of foie gras in the center of the meat. It's tender, delicious, beautiful (yes I said beautiful) perfection. The only reason I knocked off a star is simply because the burger comes with mustard and to be frank, I am not a fan of the condiment at all. Rather than that I don't have any complaints. The pommel frites were amazing as well, but how can they not be? The service was very friendly and helpful too.

His side dish- some type of pasta- was tasteless, bland, literally no flavor! They must not believe in salt. My orecchiette (Italian pasta nevertheless) was so bland!!!

2.0,2/5/2018,"THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY FOR THE ORIGINAL DB BURGER. 5 Star for Service, 2 star for overhype, 1 star for burger- probably the most overrated burger I ever had after DB sold me on his preparation of this infamous burger. I'm sure the quality went down since he first put this out years ago but I agree 100% with Kimberly's review on the burger below. Why advertise truffles if you don't put any, and if quality of truffles is the case, at least mask it with truffle oil. If memory will serve me right, it will go down as the coldest burger I ever had, that came out fresh. Tomato confit? Tomatoes aren't even in season and had no taste. Foie had to be less than an oz as they just put a sliver in the middle to showcase it, and short rib had no flavor. Ordered burger med rare and it was surely raw, not even rare, in the middle. And to putv the cherry on top my buns were burnt. Basics, cmon- even Mcdonalds doesn't burn their buns for their $2 burger. I paid a decent amount of money so I forced myself to eat around this but my mom told me not to take more than you can chew and maybe this is a great example DB!

1.0,2/4/2018,"Earlier this week, I ate at db Bistro Moderne for restaurant week, and I have a lot of mixed feelings about it, so here I go. We came here to try out the restaurant week menu. Our reservation was for 7:30, but I arrived at 7:00 and was seated anyway, which was great. It was really cold that night so I didn't want to be waiting by the door. Unfortunately, the table they seated me at was against the opposite wall from the door but it still somehow ended up feeling drafty. All night, I was trying to figure out how it was possible to feel a draft so far away from the door, but it didn't matter-- I had to sit there with my winter coat draped over my shoulders all night. While I was waiting for my boyfriend to join me, someone came over to offer me water. I took this opportunity to ask what options on the restaurant week menu were dairy-free. Instead of answering, he explained how the restaurant week menu works. I told him that I understood the concept of restaurant week, but I needed to know which menu items didn't have dairy in them due to dietary restrictions. After hearing this explanation he.... continued to explain the restaurant week menu all over again. This came off as extremely condescending. Since that man was of absolutely no help, I waited to ask the waiter (a different man) when he came around to take our order. This time, this man actually scoffed and said ""Everything has dairy,"" gesturing to the whole menu. Disappointed, and taken aback by this response, and said ""Okay then, what am I supposed to eat?"" At this point, he then started singling out certain menu items like the fish and steak saying that these items would be safe. If he knew that these items (the fish & the steak) would be safe, why did he originally tell me everything had dairy? Laughing and giving a sarcastic answer is probably #1 on the list of bad customer service ideas. Off the restaurant week menu, I ordered the Baby Kale Salad (without the gorgonzola), the Hanger Steak, and the Dark Chocolate Marquise. The dessert did have cream or milk in it, but I do take lactaid pills so I decided to take the risk. The waiter did offer pineapple sorbet as a dairy free alternative, but I was so cold, I didn't want to be eating a frozen dessert. While we were waiting for the appetizers to come out, we were given bread for the table, and a little dish of cauliflower that was roasted, maybe? The cauliflower had a crunchy coating on it with a balsamic drizzle underneath and was really good. The bread was not. I tried cutting into a roll with my knife but the bread was almost so doughy and stretchy that the knife did nothing. As much as I tried to break off a piece, I was only denting the roll with the knife. When I finally ate a piece, I immediately regretted it. It was chewy and bland and just not worth it. The Baby Kale Salad was pretty standard-- nothing to complain about but it wasn't outstanding either. The Hanger Steak was actually very good and probably the highlight of my meal, though it sat on a really sad bed of lettuce. There's just no other way to describe the lettuce that was on the plate with the steak. It was wilted and sad, and as soon as I looked at it, I knew that was exactly how it needed to be described in this review. I didn't eat any, obviously. The entrees were served with a little cup of french fries and ketchup, and the fries were really good while they were still hot. The dark chocolate dessert was pretty standard. Finally, when the bill came, we split it and put it on our cards. We both signed our receipts, and then my boyfriend went to the restroom. The waiter came to pick up the receipts, he abruptly asked, ""Where's the second receipt?"" I said, ""It's not in there? I know he signed his and I put mine in there too. I'm sure it's in there because I saw him sign it.""  Waiter says, ""Well obviously he didn't because I only have one receipt. When he comes back, you need to make sure he gives it to me,"" and walks away. I'm not saying he was wrong for needing the receipt, but his attitude (throughout the whole night) was appalling. When my boyfriend returned from the restroom, he still must have forgotten to slip the receipt back into the folder because we were halfway out the door when our waiter came rushing after us, saying, ""I told you to have him leave the receipt! You need to give it to me!"" Completely unprofessional. Originally, I was planning on giving db Bistro Moderne 2 stars for the supremely rude and unhelpful staff I experienced. I thought 2 stars because I did enjoy my steak a lot, but our waiter really ruined the experience. However, after writing this review and re-living the experience, I'm only giving 1 star. I really wish I got the waiter's name because he left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm angry about the experience all over again.

4.0,1/30/2018,"Another great place to try for RW! It is so close to the heart of Times Square yet you don't feel like you're in the hectic area at all and can really wind down with a good friend over good food.Food 4/5:Apps:Kale Salad- the salad is light with some delicious candied pecans! I did find the blue cheese fairly strong though so definitely need to assemble the bite well to get the right flavors.Venison & Pate- different from other pate I've tried as it didn't come out with any accompaniments (I like to spread it over some nice bread or crackers); though there was a phyllo type crust around the venison & foie gras, the flavor wasn't really great. Also there were a few parts that were too gelatinous...The chef did send complimentary cauliflower amuse bouches which were nutty and delicious too- just a nice little bite.Mains:Famous DB Burger- After hearing so much about this amazing burger, my friend and I knew we had to try it (even with the $14 supplement). The sirloin meat was tender and cooked medium- no complaints there! And surprisingly the short ribs filling was super prominent in flavor. Meaty and juicy, this was quite the burger BUT I must admit I couldn't really smell or taste any truffles or even the foie gras...Lemon Sole- ordered a light fish dish to balance out what we knew was going to be a heavy meaty burger. And this dish turned out to be amazing!!! The fish was super flaky and soft; served over some rice in a tantalizingly subtle lemon sauce.Desserts:Coconut Gateau-surprisingly this was the best fruity dessert! Perfect amount of creamy and crunchy and tart and sweet! Definitely tasted the pineapple, passion fruit, and coconut in perfect harmony.Chocolate Mousse- the chocolate cake/mousse was good but nothing spectacular. The ice cream dollop had a gold flake on top, which was of course so very pretty.Ambience 5/5:The place is bigger than it looks and has a very calm and chic vibe. I love how you can actually have a conversation here over a bottle of wine! The bottles offered for RW were decent too. And the waitstaff were all courteous and polite!

5.0,1/22/2018,"I don't know about anyone else but coming to DB Bistro Moderne is always like visiting an old friend--lots of fond memories and within a comfortable environment. I've been coming to DB Bistro Moderne for the past 3 years and I must say, my dining experience never ceases to meet my expectations. Unlike my previous dining experiences at DB Bistro Moderne which usually consist of a fish entree, I decided be a bit adventurous and order meat. Now if you know me in person, you'd know that I haven't eaten meat in years but today (until recently), I decided to take the plunge (after having a wonderful steak at a steakhouse in Toronto, but I digress). At this point, if you're someone who's quite fond of eating meat, you're probably wondering ""Why here? There are better places to have an entree that has meat?"", and you know what? You're absolutely right but the way I look at it, you've gotta start somewhere so why not at a restaurant by chef Daniel Boulud? For my lunch entree, I had the hanger steak frites which came with fries, while accompanied by a nice bottle of red wine (can't remember which one though). As usual, the service was excellent. The waitstaff were polite, professional, and well informed of the food menu as well as wine pairings for the meal. I look forward to coming back again soon.",0,0,0,Soomé U.,"New York, NY",3,59,41
2.0,1/21/2018,"I was super disappointed with this experience. It's my second time at a DB restaurant and it's the second time I've been let down.I came here with my husband, who was so looking forward to trying the infamous DB burger stuffed with foie gras and black truffle. We sat down and ordered a cocktail each. I went for the Lie in Wait (bourbon, allspice, lemon, honey, angostura), which was a fantastic drink for winter - the allspice was the perfect touch. Hubby went for the Louis XIX (rye-based) and he enjoyed his. We also had a bottle of Sky Zinfandel which was quite unique and tasty ($89) from Napa. The cheapest bottle of wine on the menu was $65, btw. The wine took a while to get to our table, but I have a feeling something was going on that night:The table next to us was complaining about their wait time for their meals, as was the table across from us...The bread was yummy, and then out came the amuse bouche. They were little fried potato bites. They were a little salty, if you ask me, but otherwise tasty. My scallops were cooked well, with squash and fennel, but..... now we get to the burger debacle. For a $35 burger stuffed with foie gras and truffle, I'd expect something amazing. Here we go:1. It was cold. 2. Truffle is a VERY recognizable smell/taste. I'm not sure it was even in this burger. Didn't smell it OR taste it.3. The piece of foie gras was almost unnoticeable, compared to what is shown in the pictures (see mine for comparison!)4. The slices of tomato were so cold, they were almost frozen.5. Hubby asked for the burger to be medium... but... it was raw.On any other occasion, I would've sent this meal back. BUT, it took its time getting there and we were catching an 8pm show. At this point it was already 7:25 so I knew we'd never make it. But, it didn't matter because our waiter, although very nice, NEVER came back to the table to even ask us how things were going. I wouldn't have been able to send it back if I wanted to. Cheese plate for dessert was good. Kind of hard to mess that up..So, between the shit burger and the long wait, maybe they felt bad? They gave us some cookies on the house in addition to the petit fours that everyone gets. So, DB restaurants are 2 for 2 with bad experiences. Probably not going to try a 3rd.$220 got us:- burger- scallops- cheese plate- 2 cocktails- $89 bottle of wine",3,0,1,Kimberly D.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",111,356,1582

5.0,1/15/2018,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at DB Bistro Moderne. The service and food were excellent. It was a wonderful way to celebrate his birthday. When we walked in, the hostess, manager, and coat check attendant welcomed us. We were immediately whisked away to our table. Our waiter Chuck E was wonderful and attentive. He asked what water we preferred (bottled, tap, sparkling, etc.) It's a common courtesy to ask for water preference in Europe so I was surprised when he asked but found the gesture to be thoughtful. My boyfriend ordered the War Flag and I ordered Jack's Hard Cider. The stout was delicious and was rich with coffee and chocolate. I normally prefer sweet ciders and while this cider was not very sweet, it was perfect for the course of our meal because it complimented what we ate.We began our meal with a delightful bread basket. There were two dinner rolls, a pretzel roll, and two thick pieces of brown bread. The pretzel roll was lovely. You must smell the brown bread. It smelled divinely of rosemary and tasted exactly like rosemary. The butter came on a small plate and was very high quality butter. With the way we were greeted and with the bread and butter alone, we were excited to progress with our meal.We then ordered the chicken liver mousse and hummus. The hummus had raisins in it and incredibly flavorful and unlike any hummus I had ever had. It was accompanied with pita triangles. The chicken liver mousse was incredible. It was so smooth and rich. My boyfriend had never had chicken liver mousse and while he was interested in trying it, was nonetheless hesitant. He said that it was wonderful and was astounded by the flavor. The chicken liver was bordered with butter and came with crostini. We then were given a complimentary amuse bouche. It looked like a meatball but consisted of potato with a red pepper sauce. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the diver scallops and I ordered the Original DB Burger. He said that the scallops were very flavorful and light. While he feels that they would not have been filling on their own, by the time he finished his plate he felt content. I set out knowing that I wanted the DB Burger. I wanted to know what a $35 burger tasted like. The reviews on Yelp suggested that the DB burger misses the mark. I sadly have to agree with the consensus. It was a gamey burger which I liked but the foie gras and short ribs did not add flavor and it fell flat. If you're looking for a greasy cheeseburger, this is not it. But if you're looking to say that you've an incredibly expensive and fancy burger that is massive and that you have to eat with a fork and knife, one that is filled with foie gras, short ribs, and black truffle on a parmesan bun, then this is it. But if you're looking for a burger that is flavorful and is half or a third of the cost, you might be left feeling unfulfilled. The surplus of fries that came with the burger were great. For dessert my boyfriend ordered the sorbet trio and I ordered the sticky toffee pudding. The sorbet flavors were green apple, dark chocolate, and coconut. He said that the sorbet was amazing and would come back for it alone. I was expecting a bowl of sticky toffee pudding. The pudding that came out was more on the deconstructed side. While it does not look like a regular sized portion of dessert, it was rich and delicious. Our meal ended with complimentary petit fours that came in flavors of Irish cream, peanut butter, and I believe what was sugar covered apricot jelly.I had noted on the Opentable reservation that this was for a birthday. When our dessert came out, Chuck E presented us a bowl of madeleines. They were warm, light, lemony, and covered with powder sugar. The plate had ""Happy Birthday"" written on it. It was very kind of the restaurant to add to our celebration. I very much appreciated that they took note of the Opentable remark. We also appreciated that they kept the birthday quiet and tasteful and did not make a spectacle of it. Between meals, Chuck E cleaned off our table. Cleaning off the table and delivering complimentary bites is what I think makes a restaurant be from great to excellent. While we cannot come here as often as we'd like, we will remember that we had a wonderful dining experience and appreciated every second.",2,0,0,Esther L.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",90,173,518

The skin was crispy, the fish was cooked amazing, go team!The famous DB Burger? Yeah.. .It didn't knock off the Minetta Tavern Black Label burger as the best I ever had, Sorry Chef Daniel Boulud. The meat blend was amazing. They created a pocket and stuffed the patty with the short rib, foie-gras, and black truffles. It made the burger as a whole complex and it didn't gel together. When I took my first bite, I had the onion roll, beef patty, short rib meat and foie-gras. I had to deconstruct the sandwich to appreciate each component. It was good, don't get me wrong but for $35 bucks I expected it to be the king of all all burgers. I was not.DB Bistro Moderne is a Chef Daniel Boulud establishment.

The brussels sprouts were somehow simultaneously raw and mushy on the outside, no crisp.

5.0,11/3/2017,"I had been to Daniel Boulud's restaurant in Vegas, and really enjoyed myself.  So, when a client suggested we meet for dinner at DB's bistro near Time Square, I was happy to do so.  They offer a 3 course prix fixe menu, and also an ala carte menu.  We started off w/ a complimentary tomato confit to go w/ our tempranillo wine ($18).  The starter and wine was a nice way to whet our appetites for the main courses:  4 Stars.For our mains, we had the foie gras terrine w/ green apple ($24), and the agnolotti w/ brown butter, butternut squash, ricotta, and sage ($31).  We ended up sharing both plates.The foie gras was amazing.  A terrine is like a piece of art, and it really takes a skilled chef to prepare one. The exec chef here has been trained very well bc the terrine ate like a meal.  I don't believe foie gras is available in CA any longer, so when I see it on the menu, I indulge:  5 Stars.Likewise, the agnolotti was well thought out.  The ingredients paired expertly together.  Brown butter is an art, and again the exec chef has been trained well.  This dish also ate like a meal.  I was thoroughly satisfied visually & gastronomically:  5 Stars.For dessert, the complimentary petit fours was a nice surprise.  However, the gateau w/ figs & pistachio ice cream was excellent.  The ingredients were unique and paired excellently together.  It was a fantastic way to end the meal:  5 Stars, Regarding the ambiance, its a small place that is good for a before theatre meal.  Nonetheless, it didn't feel too cramped our loud:  4 Stars.  However, what really stood out was the excellent service from our waiter, José, and the Mgr, Carmelo.  José hails from Ecuador.  He was super friendly and attentive:  So was the entire team.  Our water glasses were constantly being refilled, and the crumbs were swept away after the mains.  Carmelo stopped by and I informed him how good the service was from José.  He took my card and added me to their mailing list:  Thats excellent customer service!The experience here hit on all cylinders.  The presentation and ingredients of the dishes were well thought out.  In addition, the excellent service from the manager down to all the waitstaff made for a very pleasant experience.",35,27,34,Joe P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",99,1698,6494

We selected our meal off the pre-fixe menu. The menu was full of great choices. My girlfriend had the lobster salad, steak frites, and chocolate dessert. I had the frisée aux lardon salad, the sweet potato gnocchi (it was SPECTACULAR), and the pecan macaron. And the meals came out in a timely fashion so that we had ample time to walk to the theater. Oh, and I should mention that the restaurant gave us a complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary celebration! What a wonderful gesture!My only critique, and I do hope restaurant management reads this: DB Bistro Moderne should offer a more diverse non-alcoholic drink menu. For example, my girlfriend and I wanted mocktails and asked to have some of the custom fruit cocktails without alcohol. We were told that wasn't possible because the alcohol was already mixed in to the drinks, so I assumed that there was a batch of these drinks. Then I asked if the restaurant had non-alcoholic sparkling apple cider, like Martinelli's.  They didn't have it either. Not that it mattered because we ended up getting our usual seltzer and iced tea. However, I do hope the restaurant will be more accommodating to people who want to enjoy a night out.Otherwise, I definitely look forward coming back here and recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice solid meal before they head to the theater.",0,0,0,Anthony I.,"BAYSIDE, NY",157,8,25

4.0,9/26/2017,"Overall my daughter and I enjoyed DB Bistro.  This is the 4th  of his places we have been to.  She had the Pre-Theater dinner, with what may have been the best lobster salad I have tasted.  She then had the cod, which she said was very good.  It looked great.  And her selection of the chocolate dessert was very light and delicious.  I started with the steak tartare, which was exceptional, (no capers, so it was different).  I also had the db Bistro Burger, which I REALLY wanted to love.  It was very good, but why they would put a horseradish sauce on a burger with black truffles and foie gras is beyond me.  I thought it totally fought with the other 2 flavors.  The toasted bun also didn't come close to holding up to the burger - a pet peeve of mine, especially when paying $35 for a burger.

The service was good-not spectacular. Everything was at best, average which was certainly disappointing for a DB restaurant. The watermelon proscuitto crostini was yummy, the lemon verbena/blueberry dessert was also different and had great flavor. I had cod which was dry, fishy and a little cold. One friend had scallops which were good, but an tiny portion. There was nothing that anyone said, ""omg you have to taste this."" Think maybe this place will go the way of DBGB....away.

I'm sure DB himself hasn't set foot in it for years.  Among the sad experiences: a lobster appetizer with an $8 surcharge that tasted as if it was from a frozen batch of shelled lobster meat bought in bulk. In other words, tasteless.I guess the fussy dessert was the best thing.

Anyway, the food, as I found was usual for NYC, was extremely good. We both ordered a fairly simple meal of bacon, potatoes, toast and a mimosa, and though nothing overly exciting, each of our dishes was seasoned and cooked to perfection. For us, it was a nice, quiet break before some additional sightseeing, and we ended up staying longer than we expected just to chat and relax.

4.0,7/8/2017,"In this week's episode of #BurgerQuest, my travels brought me to DB Bistro Moderne, arguably the birthplace of the modern ""haute"" gourmet burger craze.  Chef Daniel Boulud's DB burger is like a Cadillac of beef, stuffed with short rib, foie-gras, and black truffle - and I knew that I just HAD to try it while I was in NYC.I dropped in for lunch and pretty much immediately ordered the DB burger, although some of the other items on their menu sounded quite tasty as well.  Whilst I waited for my burger to be delivered, I was provided a complimentary basket of fresh baked, tasty breads and some nice, salty butter - perfect appetizers to nosh on whilst I eagerly awaited the main course.When my DB burger arrived, I probably spent a good 2-3 minutes taking pictures of it on my iPhone, much to the bemusement of my server.  This thing was born to be an Instagram star, with its rich layers, hefty beef patty, and toasty parmesan bun.  Post this on your social media account for an instant +100 likes.  The burger came served with a platter of nicely crispy pomme frites (if you're eating a gourmet burger stuffed with foie-gras, you might as well call them pomme frites instead of French fries) and 3 different dipping sauces.So the burger looked amazing, but did it TASTE amazing?In short - yes and no.  I think the burger patty itself was spectacular - the beef was extremely high quality, cooked perfectly medium-rare, and was quite filling.  The short ribs added a lovely ""gamey"" taste that I thought complemented the beefy patty nicely.  But the other ingredients didn't really ""gel"" with the burger into a cohesive taste.  I thought the foie-gras felt out of place, as if it was just forced into the burger to make it more expensive/gourmet, and the burger itself was pretty huge and ungainly to eat.  The parmesan bun was nicely toasted but didn't do a great job of soaking up the burger juices.Ultimately, I felt like the individual ingredients were all spectacular - but they didn't combine or complement each other extremely well.  Hence, it was a great burger - but my quest to find the best burger will continue elsewhere.OVERALL: 4/5.  Definitely a fantastic experience, and for all its shortcomings it's still a great burger - well worth a stop if you're a burger lover, just to say you tried the famed DB burger!",5,1,2,Eric C.,"Katy, TX",305,498,2499
3.0,7/3/2017,"I met a few friends who flew in from out-of-town and wanted to grab dinner before their musical that night.  I hadn't really heard much from this place, but my friend said that it was pretty good.  French food is always a favorite although not necessarily my go-to, and I was looking forward to trying somewhere new, especially in the Theatre District since I tend to stay away from this area.  Two things that I got to try were their cheese table crackers and their seared scallops.Cheese Table CrackersPROS- very tasty: gruyere was the cheese of choice and it was on point- not ridiculously dryCONS- small and tiny, not enough to satisfy the craving-------Seared Scallops: this is probably one of my favorite ways to eat scallops.  I normally don't favor this one particular seafood because it tends to have a certain flavor that just doesn't feel quite 'fresh' to me.  However, if they are done well, I really do enjoy a great seared scallop entree.  PROS:- well plated, if you're into amazing plating- not overcooked: this by far would have failed the dish for me if the scallops turned out rubbery.CONS:- I'm not sure if I like just having four scallops as a main entree.  Those vegetable bits didn't quite do it for me as an accompaniment.  All in all, it wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't terrible.  I think there are other and better places though if you were to throw down money, especially for seared scallops.  The service was great, everyone was very attentive and we never had a dry cup.  I just wasn't amazed by anything.  I wouldn't turn it down but definitely so many other places in NYC to go to.",1,0,0,Vera L.,"Manhattan, NY",300,269,504

We sat talking for a bit afterwards. As we were five minutes from leaving, a gentleman (manager?) came to tell us a group was waiting for our table and asked us to leave. We planned to go anyway, were shocked at the approach and request, and walked out. A block away we regretted leaving as we did, regretted not saying something, regretted going in the first place. Lovely experience squashed.While I'm not likely to put down the restaurant without provocation, you can bet money DB will not be mentioned as a meal possibility while in the theater district, or at all, when asked by friends for recommendations.

3.0,4/16/2017,"Pardon me while I shake myself awake after this rather dull dining experience. The overall experience was really a three, but most of the food was good enough to earn a four star rating. Make no mistake, there is nothing hip, cool, or fun about this place. Don't let anyone give you that impression. This is straight up ""business lunch"" or ""let's venture down from the UES and live a little!"" Whomever is describing this place as ""laid back"" or ""casual"" needs an enema. Not that there's anything wrong with boring. I was just expecting a little more pizzazz. We visited on Easter Sunday and both ordered the pre fixe. I'm usually pretty mature about restaurants not always being family friendly, because not every restaurant can or should cater to kids, but if you're doing a holiday pre-fixe, consider for 30 seconds that families may be interested, and a little kids menu or kid-friendly item might be a welcome addition. So my kid ate $12 monkey bread. It was that or a $10 sausage link. As for mom and dad - we both started with the potato and leek soup. I've had better on airplanes. I also can't stand when restaurants don't put salt and pepper on your table. I might need it when you forget to use it back in the kitchen.  For main course, I had the Atlantic salmon with dill and horseradish sauce, which I enjoyed. Found the salt for that one, they did. My husband went with the steak and frites, except the frites were just roast potatoes and there were two eggs on the steak. He loved it, but please deliver the item on the menu, merci. He has celiac disease so the only option for him for dessert was ice cream, which was made of cream and also frozen. Vanilla, coffee, or chocolate were his options. SNOOOOOOOZ. I had the carrot cake, which was outstanding. Let's talk more about the icing. I'd like a tub of it to sit in later. We also enjoyed a nice bottle of Sancerre, as all wines were 50% off for the day. Coffee was fine, despite arriving at the table about halfway through dessert. All in all, food was good here but the atmosphere was duller than a crayon. I also loathe when restaurants have no waiting area in the front of the restaurant yet don't greet you when you're forced to stand/sit at the tiny bar, and staff makes you feel as though you've just put your feet up on the table. Do away with the stupid ""communal table"" if you need space for your guests to wait.",2,1,0,Cydnee R.,"New York, NY",104,41,10

These tiny bites might be what I best remember. Next; the Salmon Rillade appetizer was a simple, clean, and tasty dish, especially if one considers that the workaday American equivalent of this plate is a tuna fish sandwich. On the staff's recommendation, I choose the seafood Bouillabaisse. A bowl of Hake, shrimp, and mussels arrived; my server then poured in a clear saffron broth. Kudos for presentation there! This was another well-executed dish, but maybe a bit too thin for the day's sub-freezing temps. My dessert course was the chocolate brownie. This was really good.

3.0,6/28/2016,"The food was perfectly fine but nothing to make me want to go back. I think they are aiming to mimic a European bistro and having grown up in Europe, I like this approach. However, to pull it off, you have to have good ingredients cooked well. They only hit ""fine"" on both of these measures. For example, I had the Provencal chicken was reasonably tasty and a little overcooked, although thankfully not to the point of dryness.

5.0,5/20/2016,"My husband and I walked into DB Bistro at 5pm on a Saturday after taking a peek at the menu outside. My husband is familiar with David Boulud and was excited to finally be able to dine at one of his restaurants. I expected to be turned away because we were dressed casually in jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers and even explained my reservations to the hosting staff, but they welcomed us in. Because we didn't have a reservation, we weren't able to be seated at a normal table, but there was an eight seat hi-top table in the bar that we were told had the same menu and service as the normal tables, so we were quickly seated there. The service was impeccable--not too overbearing, but not distant either. We were treated to a lovely bread service and a special breadstick plate, which had two small breadsticks served with a basil aoli and an olive teppenade--the basil aoli was out of this world!My husband ordered the Singapore Sling, which was well prepared. It wasn't to my taste, but he enjoyed it greatly. At $17, I would say it was overpriced, but a) this is new York and b) we were celebrating his birthday and we didn't get any appetizers so I let it slide. My husband ordered the skirt steak, which was incredible. It was well seasoned or marinated (I'm not sure which) and was one of the most tender steaks I've ever had. My husband and I agree that it outshines the twice-as-expensive steaks at our local, high class steakhouse. I would definitely order it the next time we go, if it's still on the menu. It was outstanding. When we were originally seated, our waiter informed us that we could order anything off the prix-fixe menu a la carte, so I ordered the Curried Carrot Risotto. Again, the chef knocked it out of the park with this surprising entree. I was a little hesitant to order it, as I was worried that the curry would be spicy (I don't do well with spicy foods), but there was no spice whatsoever, just a mild yellow curry flavor. The risotto was creamy and cooked to perfection, topped with shreds of chicken confit and chickpeas. The portion was generous and since I have a small stomach, I wasn't able to finish the dish, so the remainder was packed up--I had intended to eat it on the train back to New Jersey, but it was gone long before we left the city. As a final treat, the host staff arranged to surprise my husband with a complimentary birthday dessert--I had mentioned we were celebrating his birthday when we originally arrived at the restaurant, thinking nothing of it, but they decided we were going to celebrate with dessert too!! My husband was brought a decadent chocolate torte with olive oil marscapone and olive oil powder (yes, powder!). The flavors blended together perfectly. The torte was rich, but not overly so--between the two of us, we were able to finish the dessert without feeling overly stuffed or weighed down by the chocolate.Our total came to $88 before tip, which is INCREDIBLY reasonable for an upscale restaurant in New York City, in my opinion. I made sure to thank the staff repeatedly for making our night. My husband and I are still talking about our experience a week later and are eagerly awaiting our next trip to NYC so we can return.",3,0,0,Amy K.,"Maple Shade Township, NJ",4,30,7
2.0,5/12/2016,"First the good...or rather not so bad:The ambiance, if you sit in the back, is nice and relaxed, although a couple of the overhead lights were out. They offer a good wine list, with a nice range of options.Service was decidedly lackluster, and I'm being overly generous...much like the level of salt in every dish we tried. For example, I'm used to my waiter switching out the white napkin for a dark one when I'm wearing dark pants. Not here! Most importantly, our waiter went missing for much of the dining experience--to the point that one of the other waiters came over a couple of times to ask if she could help us. Okay, now on to the less than spectacular:This place, despite repeated assurances when I called ahead multiple times to check, is most definitely not vegan-friendly...at all! First, there was not a single item on the menu that was vegan! Then, both the waiter and maître d' seemed completely flummoxed by the concept. I'm guessing a similarly clueless discussion went on behind the scenes before the three-course meal emerged (after an extensive delay), consisting of a couple of salads and three scoops of sorbet. With a month's notice and a reminder two days and one day in advance, surely we can come up with something a little more creative and interesting than...salty salad for $160! What is this? The 1980's???  This was a total fail, especially given their assurances BEFORE I ever made the reservation!!If you're in the market for oversalted loup de mer or a rib-stuffed burger garnished with lettered wooden dowels, and care little about service, then this might be your spot.

The burger is famous, but because it is stuffed with short ribs and topped with foie gras, it is very rich, and should only be attempted if you are very hungry.On this visit we started with some seared shishito peppers, these were smaller than usual and nicely seared, served with a soy dipping sauce.My peekytoe crab appetizer was pretty, but didn't have a lot of flavor.

This honestly bothered me a great deal, firstly and fore mostly for the sanitary issues surrounding this practice but seeing that if I'm spending $150 on dinner I should be able to keep the damn marrow bone from my meal without having to coax it out of the chef, I paid for it after all!",0,0,0,Seth D.,"New York, NY",37,4,3

2.0,1/31/2016,"Having dined at Daniel Boulud's flagship restaurant ""Daniel,"" I had high hopes for this restaurant. Sadly, it was mostly a disappointment. A friend and I attended DB Bistro for the restaurant week menu. Judging from the other tables, most customers had the same idea. The first thing I noticed was the restaurant week menu was different from what was listed on the website. Some appetizers and the desserts were the same, but the main courses were completely changed. I was about a half hour early for my reservation, and decided to take a seat at the bar/lounge area in the entrance of the restaurant. My beverage order was taken quickly, but it took 20 minutes for the drink to be brought to my table. By the time I received my drink, my friend had arrived and my table was ready. It would have been nice to have my drink shortly after it was ordered, as the bar area was not busy, and customers who sat directly at the bar, yet arrived after my order had been taken, were given their drinks first. Once we were seated, one of the first things I noticed was a lack of music. There was simply nothing to be heard other than the loud chatter of the patrons, and the footsteps of the wait staff throughout the cramped dining space. Our server was very attentive, and was possibly the highlight of the evening. I wish I could say the same about the food.Amuse-bouche: Cracker with goat cheese spread. It was fine. Nothing much to say. Simply fine.Appetizer: House Made Terrine. Underwhelming to say the least. Tasted like a cold slice of lunchables meat, with a bell pepper coulis hastily spread across the plate. a frisee separated the two slices on the plate, which combined were smaller than a post-it note. Main: Roasted Pork Loin with Bok Choy. The pork was incredibly well cooked and tender, the onion soubise was acceptable, albeit a bit salty. The Bok Choy was the best part of the course, and was perhaps the finest I've had. This was a hit, but resembled more of an above average home-cooked meal than one from a Daniel Boulud restaurant. Dessert: My friend got the grapefruit pavlova, which was delicious based on the one taste I had. I wish i ordered this, instead of the dark chocolate gateau. There was simply no texture to this dessert. Coffee mousse which had surely been sitting on the now soggy ""biscuit"" for some time. This exemplified the feel of the entire meal. Judging from the courses coming out to other tables, I would say the kitchen had been preparing and plating a lot of these meals ahead of time; the restaurant week menu being the kid brother to the ala cart. The whole service had the feel of a mediocre wedding reception, where each diner was presented with an uninspired version of what they believed to be ordering. We also received an assortment of petit fours after dessert. I was excited to see a macaroon, as they are my favorite French pastry. With disappointment, the macaroon fell apart before I could eat it. The filling  was not settled, and must have melted as the top half of the meringue slipped off the second i picked it up. It was also extremely chewy, and lacked flavor. My friend had the other two--some vanilla cake and citrus gummy-like cube. She said it was ""fine"" and ""very citrusy."" The final one was a chocolate candy filled with caramel, which was quite good. From beginning to end, this was just a lackluster experience from a DB restaurant. I was awe struck at the difference between the 2 michelin star flagship, and this midtown mediocrity. I will not be returning anytime soon.",0,0,0,John D.,"Manhasset, NY",0,26,6

My skatewing was nice, as was my friend's pork shoulder, but i was disappointed in the cheese plate i got for dessert. The two cheeses were very bland and nothing special.

Salmon and Diver Sea Scallops were cooked perfectly. Both dishes were slightly under seasoned however we have come to the conclusion that all French bistro fare is under seasoned from Paris to New York. So, perhaps not a critique of DB but of all French bistro fare. Scallops were not quite as hot as I would have liked but were delicious none the less.

For the second course, I had the Flank steak with spätzle and carrots. The steak was nicely cooked - no complaints there, but thought the spätzle made the dish a bit too heavy or should have at least had more carrots.

4.0,8/26/2015,"This place was really conveniently close to our office and a favourite place to entertain clients / visiting dignitaries. Also had quite a few team celebrations, and you can also order from here on Caviar! Needless to say I've engaged with them more times than I can count.DB Bistro, started by the same famous Daniel as the eponymous Daniel on the Upper East Side, serves a more casual / modern variant of ""New America""/French cuisine. Although it carries traditional dishes such as foie gras, patés, steak and such, it presents them with bolder and more innovative flavours -- and in a good way. One of my favourites though has got to be the DB Bistro burger -- it's a massive piece of work, with a freshly-ground burger stuffed with foie gras that is just oozing with juicy deliciousness. I've rarely seen a burger taken to this level before and it's something that my colleagues enjoy a lot as well.Also great wine by the glass/carafe here, very good value and quality.

Surprising a name chef like Daniel Boulud would be associated with this place, really pretty mediocre fare, excepting the desserts which were really quite good.This experience got off with a rousing thud by way of very condescending attitude by front of house. Had 5:00 reservation so we could make a 7:00 curtain, arrived promptly at 5:02 to a entry area full of unseated patrons because staff was still effing around with the table candles, asked when we'd be seated, got a snotty answer from a dark haired hostess---ugh, nice start!!As for meal it was just ok, pate (without crostini) nondescript, coq au vin pretty good, Amish chicken bone dry and underseasoned.

For the main course I had a tilefish entree and my friend had the pork. Both were phenomenal. And for dessert I went with a blueberry pavlova and my friend had the cheese plate.

The service was great - very attentive but not overbearing. I appreciate the amuse bouche and petite fours that came with our meal - things I always look forward to when going to fancy french restaurants.Appetizer: We shared the artichoke dip which was good. They didn't skimp on the dip, which meant we could use the rest of the bread from our bread basket to polish it off.Entrees: I had the coq au vin and I'm a fan! It was so delicious and savory, and the meat fell off the bone. I would get it again. My boyfriend got their famous burger, which he said was ""good but it's not for people who like burgers"". I'm not quite sure what that means. I guess don't get it if you're a burger lover looking for a good burger. Dessert: We had previously been to Daniel Boulud's other restaurant, Boulud Sud, and I remember the desserts there being very good. DB must really like his desserts because our desserts here were equally delicious and beautifully presented. I got the raspberry and nectarine bellini: so light and refreshing! Not too sweet. Perfection. My boyfriend got what we joked was a fancy smore, toasted marshmallow with dark chocolate and graham ice cream. He liked it though.

I had the warm lobster salad (25) dollars, which honestly was tiny, should have been a lobster cocktail, and it was Super SUPER sweet which I was shocked out because it had a chili vinaigrette, think it was going to be tart or spicy but no. Then thinking outside of the box of my norm,  I wanted something that sounded good. I usually dont order fish at restaurants unless its rare fish, but I didn't want steak nor did I want salmon, so I ordered the halibut, and this was the epic fail for me... the halibut was over cooked that it was tough and dry, then the fennel and artichokes vegetables were steamed to DEATH but charcoaled on the outside, so it was was eating crunchy water with no taste, and then the saffron sauce that lined the plate just tasted like mustard, I was sorely not happy but I didn't want to be a diva and make a big deal, so I ate it and thought I need to order something else cause this did NOT hit the spot.So I told the bartender my dilemma and he suggested the foie gras, and to be honest the texture was great, soft/silky but it had no depth of flavor at all, AT ALL. it was flavorless, and the apple-like gelatin sauce on the side was cold. To be honest, I think it would have made the dish 10 times better if the sauce was warm, have luke warm bread, and cold foie gras, and cold sauce, it leave you wanting some flavor profile or pow of surprise that was missing.The bartender apparently told one of the managers (a very nice brunette lady) and we had a nice chat because we both work in food so we got along.

Everything was good, though the bone only had a small amount of marrow (I know there's not a lot to begin with, but it was missing from the entire right hand side of the bone). There was one sausage I didn't like on the charcuterie platter, but my husband liked it. I got a special of the day, a delicious egg yolk raviolo. Technically an appitizer, it was a whopping  $42 so I enjoyed it as an entree by sharing a side of kale with my husband. He got a beautiful short rib that I beleieve was also a special. The side of kale was good, but pretty standard.We finished off with dessert and coffee and this is where I get a little ticked off.

We ate a warm lobster salad for appetizer which was very fresh and lovely. We also split the beet salad with endive..very fresh. The bread they bring to start the meal is a nice mix. We ordered a glass of rose to sip off the main menu which was great.For main course, we later split the DB burger. I was very excited to try this even though the reviews were mixed on Yelp. This wasn't thrilling. I know it's the main attraction, but I think this is very hit or miss. First, the sirloin meat itself lacked flavor. The short rib wasn't compelling or juicy, could barely taste foie gras, and I tasted a bit of a horseradish type sauce somewhere. The fries were good. But they were just skin-on typical fries. This was really my least favorite dish. My sister seemed to enjoy it more than I did.For dessert: we had cappuccino and the Meyer lemon passionfruit semifreddo...this was refreshing and lovely.The service here however, was impeccable and we were treated great.

3.0,1/27/2015,"6/10To be completely frank, I am not sure why everyone is raving about this place/the burger here. It was disappointing, and also expensive for no reason :( Dont get me wrong, if the food is good, I am willing to pay a substantial amount of money, but this foie gras burger was not worth it at all. First, my burger was not all that warm. When it came out (it is already cut for you), I was initially impressed with the color because I like my burgers medium rare/medium (some restaurants in nyc dont even know how to cook a burger). However, when I took my much anticipated first bite, the burger was barely warm. I am not sure how they prepare these burgers. Let them rest before serving? Cook a bunch at a time and then reheat to order in the convection oven? Nor sure, but in any case, they should definitely have monitored the burger temperature a lot more. I expected more out of a Chef Boulud restaurant. I thought the short rib inside the burger was very nice and added a different flavor profile than a regular burger (a more chewy texture, reminding me of a pulled pork sandwich). Lastly, the foie gras placed in the middle of the burger was tiny and I did not taste truffle at all. All in all, I came here to try the burger, and decided it is definitely not worth the trip or the price tag. The restaurant itself has a cool ambience. There are two areas connected by a narrow walkway which is probably why some people think it's cramped. I thought it was perfectly fine and cozy. The place looks somewhat retro with the tables and lighting. I enjoyed the ambience and the wait staff.",3,0,1,Tony A.,"Chicago, IL",540,33,22

4.0,1/23/2015,My wife and I were going to see Billy Joel and wanted a nice dinner beforehnad but also one that we didn't have to get super dressed up for. We had previously been to Bar Boulud and thought we would try this restaurant. It is small inside but we did not feel cramped at all. Because Billy would not take the stage until about 9 we could take our time even though we had an earlier reseravtion. This allowed for a nice unrushed pace and we could order of the full menu rather than just the pre-theater menu. Our service was very good. The waiter was present but not rushing at all. As for the food. We shared the bone marrow and charcuterie  then my wife had the white truffle raviolo and I had the veal cheeks. These course were very good however dessert was soso to the point that two weeks later I don't remember what we had.If you are in midtown/times square/theater district I would definitely hit this place up.,1,0,1,Jason S.,"Morris Plains, NJ",8,51,12
5.0,1/14/2015,"My wife and I ate here last year and she still talks about the deserts. So we scheduled a return visit over our week get away to take in some shows. We were not disappointed, in fact we ended up going for dinner, then returning the next 2 nights just to try the desserts. On the 4th night after the NYPO, we tried Boulud Sud for dessert after the Symphony.Service was fast, correct and pleasant. Decor was as you'd expect in this class of place in the theater district. If you are expecting Daniel, then this probably won't be your cup of tea. Coat check was quick and efficient, and drinks delivered with speed and the accuracy I would expect. Food was excellent. My wife had some trepidation about the white truffle raviolo with egg, but absolutely loved it after the first bite. I had the beef two ways and it was spectacular.  Apps were small but lively and seasoned just perfect. On our previous visit I had the duck confit. My favorite dish. I must say it was probably one of the best dishes I have ever had. Desserts are out of this world, and the mint ice cream and concord grape are so tasty we had each 3 night is a row.

4.0,11/24/2014,"I have been to one other DB place--DBGB Kitchen and Bar. But I've always wanted to try his other places--eventually I will go to Daniel, but for now, db Bistro Moderne it is. I was taken here for a pre-Broadway show dinner by my boyfriend, and it was a great experience overall. We arrived right on time for our 5pm dinner reservations, and the hostess greeted us courteously before showing us to the coat check woman. She took our coats and handed us a plastic ticket to pick it up later. I'm impressed at how she manages to keep everyone's coats in order, since she took two other couples' jackets at the same time. We were seated in a corner table, with one side being part of a long booth. We were right next to the door that leads to the labyrinth that takes you to the restrooms. Our waitress was professional and prompt. She allowed us ample time to decide what we wanted to eat and drink--no hovering, which I appreciated, even though we took a significant amount of time to choose. We started off with 8oz of Malbec each--$24/mini decanter. The wine was good quality, and I enjoyed it very much. Once we placed our orders, we were given a ""welcome"" dish from the chef--two tiny cubes of mushroom quiche. For appetizers, we got the bone marrow, pumpkin crostini, and tarte flambee. The bone marrow was served on the bone, with toasted bread on the side. The marrow was rich and delicious, but was difficult to pry off the bone. The pumpkin crostini was refreshing, not too pumpkin-y, and the perfect mouthful. The tarte flambee was sort of like a mini flatbread pizza and was also well done. For his main course, my boyfriend got the bacon-crusted halibut, and I got the mushroom risotto. Both choices were wonderful, though they took a while to prepare. Luckily, the wait staff was understanding when we asked them if they could push our orders up since we had a 7pm show to make. The halibut was cooked to perfection, as was the risotto. I've only had better risotto in France, where I think just about everything seems to taste better... But this risotto was creamy, and savory without being overwhelming or too heavy. I could have eaten another serving, easy. For dessert, they gave us three miniature pastries--a blueberry jelly, an orange macaroon, and a little cake. The space's décor was pleasant and offered a mix of contemporary chic (the ""moderne""), and traditional dining. The chic aspects included a triptych of close-up photographs of a bicycle in black and white with accents of bright red that matched the walls. The traditional was present in the carpeting and the mirrors everywhere. The layout of the place is intriguing. Once you walk through the 'exit' door that leads you to the bathroom, you can see through the glass to the tables on the other side of the hallway. But trying to get back to the side entrance is a doozy. I had to help another woman get back to the main part of the restaurant.",4,1,1,CHRISTINE Z.,"New York, NY",73,289,35
4.0,11/22/2014,"IN SHORT: What happens when a superstar chef from the upper echelons of the culinary world tries his hand at a more informal dining experience? The answer is DB Bistro Moderne, and the result is a refined, high-class setting that nonetheless relishes in simple, rustic flavors.THE STORY: Amidst the shining towers of Midtown and just a few steps away from the heart of the Theater District lies Daniel Boulud's take on elevated French bistro classics, where a burger actually means the one and only Original DB Burger stuffed with foie gras on a black truffle parmesan bun. With ingredients like these, it quickly becomes clear that even as it tries to relax its airs, high-quality food and expert techniques are still the primary focus in this comfortably elegant space.For a pre-theater dinner, DB Bistro is the perfect experience to share with a date or with family (my own mother adores this place), and the 3-course prix-fixe for $48 is a steal, still exquisitely crafted to its clientele.

It is a Sirloin Burger filled with Braised Short Ribs, Foie Gras (WHAT?) and Black Truffle (YES!), served on a Parmesan Bun and served Pommes Frites (fancy fries!). This was one of the best burgers I've ever had! The Foie Gras is mixed within it, so you don't feel like you get a huge chunk - the richness is incorporated very well. The condiments are served just as fancy as you'd expect in a restaurant of this quality. I'd recommend splitting with someone as it is a lot for one person to handle. We also split the Lamb Ragu Pappardelle. It was absolutely fantastic. The sauce was rich and the pasta was al dente. The bread is super yummy to dip in it as well!The pasta was part of a prix-fixe lunch (two courses for $32). None of the appetizers were speaking to me, so I got the Warm Chocolate Fondant - aka fancy lava cake - and MAN it was SO good. Sachiko said she isn't a huge dessert person and she loved it...at least the part she was able to get from me!

Also, the atmosphere is a strange blend of french stuffiness and casual decor.

The usual modern clichés were in abundance: tiny servings, strange presentation (strange because it just didn't work) and underwhelming but new combinations of ingredients. The gazpacho was satisfactory but pretty much tasted like cold tomato juice. My friend's lunch place (My Belly's Playlist) makes a far superior gazpacho and tonight's did not even come close.

Not very tart and it was very pudding-like. And the Yogurt Sorbet was a refreshing end to a wonderful meal.One of the best lunches I've had. It's up there with my lunch at Ai Fiori.

The beer with each plate complemented it well.  Each pour was about 1/4 of the small bottle, which was a bit stingy.  My husband had most of my share, since he is the appreciative beer guy.  The staff ended up taking care of him, which was certainly appreciated.Overall, the food and drink were very good and my husband and I greatly enjoyed each other's company...I would have liked a more engaged table experience; I think we just got a dud table...with bony people who prefer wine and not eating and just didn't want to be there.",0,0,0,Janet C.,"Cornwall, CT",83,204,54

4.0,6/23/2014,"KenScale: 8.0/10DB Bistro Moderne is a long-standing bistro from the acclaimed chef Daniel Boulud in the Times Square area. Due to its location, I've always viewed it as more a tourist trap than a serious restaurant notwithstanding Boulud's name behind it. On my recent visit, however, I did like most of the dishes I tried. I started out with a couple of appetizers. I liked the texture of beef tartare that came with quail egg and peppers that gave a slightly spicy kick. Escargot fricassee, a dish of chicken oysters, parsley and hazelnuts, was also quite tasty without being overdressed. The restaurant is perhaps best known for its Original DB Burger, a massive sirloin burger filled with braised short ribs, foie gras and black truffle, so obviously I had to try it. While I would still consider Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger the best burger in town, the DB Burger is definitely not far behind, a sheer decadence that was very juicy and well cooked. Perhaps because I was stuffed from the burger by the time we ordered desserts, but I was underwhelmed by the both items (Rhubarb Clafoutis and Cafe Brulot) compared to the delicious dishes that came before.The restaurant has that modern vibe that seems to cater to tourists hanging out in the Times Square area. It has a full bar with extensive wine collections (not surprising from a Daniel Boulud establishment). Getting a reservation isn't particularly challenging here. I do think DB Bistro Moderne, once you go there with fairly modest expectations, can offer some nice surprises.

We ordered drinks, and their version of the Manhattan was actually on the sweeter end and not too strong, which I found to my liking. For our entree, we split the DB Burger and the Kimchi Dumplings with Duck Confit. The former was just alright--the meat was cooked pretty well, but it kind of lacked flavor since the sauce on the bun was the most predominant flavor. The foie gras was pretty unnecessary as well since I barely noticed it in the meat. The duck dish was a touch better; the duck was well prepared and was interestingly paired with the slightly spicy dumplings.The service was decent and the ambiance pretty nice, although it's a bit cramped and you are sitting pretty close to other parties at the restaurant.

3.0,5/12/2014,"During Cassie's visit, we had brunch at Daniel Boulud's DB Bistro Moderne with Alice, one her close friends from Taiwan who also happened to be in NYC for work. DB Bistro offers a modern, masculine space with clean lines and chrome finishes. I really wanted to like this place, but it seemed caught somewhere between an approachable bistro and an upscale restaurant. It also doesn't help that it's in Midtown, and I got all grumpy as I was dodging people around the Times Square area. Ugh.DB Bistro has a prix fixe brunch menu with two courses for $26. However, we decided to order a la carte, which had a number of vegetarian options for me to choose from. I decided against a brunch cocktail as $16 for a drink seemed a bit steep. Our waiter brought out warm bread as soon as we had ordered our entrees. The black olive baguette was very good, especially with a little bit of butter.Alice ordered the Coq au Vin ($29), which included bacon, pearl onions, farfalle pasta. I assume it's homemade pasta. Don't know much about preparing Coq au Vin, nor can I remember the last time I've had it. Nicely plated, and Alice seemed to enjoy it.Cassie ordered The Original DB Burger, a $32 monster of a burger. Sirloin burger filled with braised short ribs, foie gras and black truffle. Served on a Parmesan bun with pomme frites on the side. I don't mind if someone around me want to order a burger. It's all about personal food choices, and I realize that vegetarianism or even flexitarianism isn't for everyone. That said, man, this was an intense burger. A meat eater's dream, perhaps? It was too rich for Cassie, and she even gave up on the bun. The pomme frites were great though. Quality potatoes, nice and crispy, very addictive. However, they were most likely fried in some kind of animal fat, which would make them not truly vegetarian. I ordered the Poached Eggs ""En Cocotte"" ($19) with creamy spinach and oyster mushrooms topped with toasted bread crumbs. The eggs were perfectly poached. The mushrooms were flavorful and the breadcrumbs were nice. Unfortunately, the spinach wasn't creamy at all, just some sad wilted spinach sitting in green water. When I was done with my meal, I had more bread and also helped Cassie finish her pomme frites. Overall, a decent brunch experience, especially if you want to catch up over a meal. You do have to brave the Midtown crowds to get here though. The service was good. My entree was a fairly tasty little dish (minus the spinach), but for this price tag, it just seemed somewhat underwhelming.

2.0,5/8/2014,"This place is often cited as the birthplace of the 'burger renaissance,' owing to the signature dish - a $30+ hamburger containing such accoutrements as short rib and foie gras.

It is also piled so high that you need either a) a mechanical vice or b) a snake-like ability to unhinge your jaw to bite into it normally- decor is a little cold- we were seated at 6:25. The menu excluding the price fix options was literally torn out of my hand once 6:30 passed without our order.

I like a more rare salmon but this was cold and cooked just enough as to be, as I said, just slimy.

Halibut with vegetables- fish was dry....I can't believe it dry....flavor was nice but good flavors can't save dry fish :(3. Chicken cordon bleu- this dish was actually good! The pastry/breading was crisp and the chicken inside was moist with the blue cheese and ham having a subtle flavor. Overall an excellent dish (why the rest of the food couldn't taste like this I don't know)4. Peanut butter chocolate ball dessert- whatever it was it was terrible.....my friend took one bite and pushed her plate away it was so bad. It was basically peanut butter on a plate Service was great and our waiter was very pleasant. The ambiance though is also a huge let down.

3.0,3/7/2014,"During Restaurant Week, restaurants usually wind up doing one of two things: (1) They use the opportunity to give diners a chance to experience the restaurant at its best, showcasing a true dedication to their clientele and the quality of food and service offered or (2) They relegate the few weeks as a period without profitability and make a half-hearted attempt to present the minimum. DB Bistro Moderne, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.I wanted to like it. After a wonderful brunch experience at Café Boulud, I was excited to try another restaurant under Daniel Boulud and eagerly made reservations here for a group of four at the start of the season. I have no complaints about the service, either. Our interactions with the host and our server that evening had were on point, and we never had an issue with getting a glass of water refilled or getting the attention of a staff member when needed. My main complaint lies, unsurprisingly, with the quality of food served that evening coupled with the effort the restaurant made to create a whole new menu specifically for Restaurant Week.To start off, my Broccoli Vichyssoise was far too watery to be called as such. It needed more cream to help offset some of the bitterness in the broccoli and the small pinch of ricotta cheese on top wasn't able to help the dish much. I was similarly unimpressed with the Pork Duo that followed, which consisted of several slices of pork tenderloin and Viennoise Sausage on top of stewed French Coco Beans. The tenderloin was pretty dry and I was unable to taste the Horseradish Gremolata that accompanied the dish. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the savory flavor of the sausage and the coco beans were cooked perfectly.Dessert was a fairly safe ending, as I opted for the profiterole - a scoop of mocha ice cream sandwiched between a choux pastry ball garnished with crushed hazelnuts and topped off with mocha cream. Not overly sweet, well-portioned, and served chilled, it was easy to clean my plate. I stole a few tastes of my friend's Brown Butter Cherry Tart as well and appreciated the acidity from the red wine cherry sorbet against the richness of the brown butter.In the end, I have to agree that DB Bistro Moderne is ""A-OK"". The food, at least during Restaurant Week, is satisfactory, but similarly fails to leave a strong impression. It's not a bad option if you happen to be in the area (good dining options in the Theater District are second to none), but I doubt it's worth a return visit.",7,3,3,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

2.0,3/1/2014,"It pains me to give this review. I really want to like every Boulud restaurant because there's just something about them that feels on point. And yet they often miss the mark just slightly and this one was no different for us. First, I loved the concept of the restaurant and also loved the menu. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and there was just the right number and variety of choices. They were offering the Restaurant Week promotion, so we both ended up ordering from it. With price supplements on a couple of items and wine, our meal for two was well over $100, so while it wasn't ridiculous, it wasn't a cheap meal. I'll start with what I liked: the service was very good (a tiny bit distracted, but friendly and fast), there were a few fine dining touches like an amuse bouche, good quality bread basket and those complimentary small petit fours/dessert bites after the meal, and all were very good, and the desserts were excellent. I also liked the wine list. And almost everything that came out was beautifully presented. Unfortunately, the food was disappointing. Nothing was disgusting and everything was well-conceived --except a caesar salad first course, which, ok, maybe I should have known better than to order a caesar salad, but I just felt like a salad and that was the only RW choice. The caesar salad was shockingly bad. Perfectly edible, but you can have a better caesar salad at some fast food places. I ate the classic hamburger and it was...just edible. Not disguting, but not memorable at all, even somewhat bland. I could not taste the foie gras and the meat felt a bit dry and cold. I can't believe this is an item that is regularly sold at $32. There are much better upscale burgers in the city (e.g. Minetta's Tavern black label). My companion had a chicken and foie gras mousse and pork risotto, both great ideas but...just ok.

And if you know risotto, you know that's hard to find and make, no matter how many episodes of barefoot contessa you watch.  Good wines.They have booths, great for dates or two couples,  but we were a big party, so we sat somewhere in the middle. The reason I'm taking a star away is because I didn't like the atmosphere,  it felt a little snobbish. And the lights are too bright.

I love foie gras, so lets give it a go and have a taste!So, I get to db bistro moderne during Restaurant Week to try out this creation of a burger that sounds extremely enticing...sirloin beef, surrounding brisket, surrounding foie gras. In my mind I was thinking seared foie gras atop of the sirloin beef, but I'm no Micheline chef, so lets dig in and see what all the fuss is about. I tried my first bite, which was a bit difficult without doing the burger smush method, as the burger was presented cut in half and towering high. So, after flattening the burger  to a height I think I can manage, I take my initial bite with an expectation of going to burger utopia. But, instead I ended up in a not so pleasant place of somewhere in the middle of Times Square with a bunch of tourist walking and then quickly making a dead stop stop right in front of me instead of walking off to the side out of my way to look up at a Broadway neon sign or something. Now pissed, I scream...'It's NYC dammit, don't you know we're all in hurry up mode and you need to get the fuq out of everyones way?!?!!'...Then I scream asking my fellow NYers...'How the hell do I get out of Times Sq and to a place better known as foodtopia?!?!?!?'........As I slowly come back to the reality of being  seated in db bistro moderne and completely underwhelmed with this overrated burger, I quickly form an opinion that if given the opportunity to come back to this restaurant I will definitely try something other than the burger.

3.0,11/10/2013,"I was really excited to come here, but have to admit some level of disappointment. A restaurant with a pedigree like this, they fell short a few places. We came on a Monday night, and it was surprisingly busy. We ordered to start the octopus and the appetizer portion of the burrata tortelli. The octopus was tasty, but served completely luke-warm at best. When the dish is called ""charred octopus"" you expect it to be hot, not room temperature. The tortelli was ok, but there was nothing special about it. Basically 6 little tortellis with minimal,'if any sauce at all on them, for $18. It was not worth the $3 per piece. For the mains, there was a vast improvement. We had the veal and the stripped bass. The veal was rolled and cut into slices, so it was like veal wrapped veal. The outside had a texture like pot roast, just falling apart, and the inside was ground veal. It came along with a fried meat fritter of sorts and sweatbreads. I loved this dish. Wifey had the fish, which had a nice crispy skin and felt very in season with the butternut purée. For dessert, we had the caramel apple, which was both light and unique in presentation. The service, however, was very lacking and not attentive at all. When we receives our check, it was missing the savored discount. Overall, for what this place costs and the pedigree, food should be hot when served, and service should be top of the line.

I was hoping to relive that at DB Bistro after reading about the crazy burger here, but was ultimately disappointed by the experience.The DB Burger is a combo of  foie gras, short rib, and sirloin. It is pricey, but you feel compelled to try it out because it's part of the standard burger repertoire in Manhattan along with Spotted Pig, Minetta Tavern, etc. Burger size is pretty small, even though it is relatively thick. Furthermore, the burger I got came out relatively cooled (and same with the fries, which tasted rather stale). In terms of the flavoring of the burger, it was nice having the foie gras and short rib add incremental oomph, but in the end the burger was relatively plain. The sirloin didn't taste like much, and even though the meats were moist and juicy, there wasn't a spaz-tastic moment for me. Not salty enough? Need more MSG? There was just a lack of umami sensation.Service was sort of intruding actually - our waiter (manager maybe?) kept on trying to upsell drinks, different appetizers, and the specials.

3.0,8/1/2013,"Came here for  Restaurant Week and got their famous Original DB Burger. It was definitely delicious and a must-try for burger fanatics/conosseurs, but as much as I appreciated the concept, I did not think it was worth the hefty price tag. It was more delicious when consumed as a deconstructed dish, and that's not how burgers should be enjoyed.The burger was served extremely tall (very thick patty), already cut in half. The sight was rather impressive, as the patty looked like a halved planet; I can actually see each ""layer,"" as the core was a cube of foie gras, surrounded by braised short ribs, with the actual burger meat as the outer ""crust."" The top was layered with fresh red onions, a frisee-looking vegetable, tomato jam, and a lovely Parmesan bun top. The bottom half had a smear of mustard and some more tomatoes.However, it was impossible to consume in the way a burger is intended to. Even if I reverted back to caveman mode and threw all social conducts out the door, I would still have to run a steam roller over it.So, I decided to eat the first half deconstructed with a knife and fork. Each component was absolutely mouth-watering delicious by itself: the sharp, mustardy bottom bun, savory short ribs, the fatty foie gras, juicy medium rare burger meat, flavorful tomato compote with the lovely, cheesy, crusty bun.Intrigued by how yummy it was deconstructed, I tried to eat the second half as a real burger should be eaten. After squishing most of the juices out of the patty in such effort, I was able to get 1 bite with all components before it fell apart. Unfortunately, all that work summed up to an okay burger, as each strong-flavored component fought to outshine one another and blurred the quality of each individual ingredient.I also got a food coma during dessert. Perhaps it was from the foie gras, which was the mildest component of the entire burger in taste (probably also the reason for the price tag) and was overpowered by all the other components.I also should comment on the rest of the meal. I had the summer squash salad, and while the 3 slices of squash was quite lackluster (poached Trader Joe yellow squash?), their creamy goat cheese + peppery arugula base, sprinkled with sunflower seeds, was absolutely divine. The profiterole dessert was unmemorable. Their pretzel baguette in the bread basket was remarkably tasty.Sometimes, simplicity is the key to fantastic food, and unfortunately I think the DB Burger missed that mark by over-complicating the concept with a bit too much decadence.",6,5,5,Tiffany T.,"Pasadena, CA",554,268,264

The food however, was mediocre at best. ""The Original"", when presented, made me scratch my head and wonder what all the hype was about. To start, this ""burger"" is tiny!

Restaurant Week is a bad time to assess any restaurant, even one with a celebrity chef. Still, the three-course lunch menu gives you a sense of the place.

The last burger that I splurged on was the Black Label Burger at MT and I am big fan of that burger albeit that was a few years ago. Daniel Boulud is a respectable name in the business, so I figured why not?The good things about this burger are that  1. it is very juicy and 2. the parmesan bun is delicious. However for a burger that is probably one of the most expensive in the city, it falls short - way short of expectations. The sirloin isn't that flavorful. Bland even, compared to some dry aged burgers but somehow does manage to completely overpower the tiny amount of foie gras that's in it. What's even the point of the foie gras if you can't taste it? To a lesser degree, this also applies to the short rib. I only got one or two bites where the flavor of the short rib was discernible.The other issue I have is the way the burger is put together. You know the scene from The Mask when Jim Carrey's jaws literally drop to the floor? I  think I may need a pair jaws like that to bite into this burger. What it lacks in width, it more than makes up in height. Why not make the buns wider and the burger flatter? Guess that would make life a little too easy.At then end of the day, its' not a bad burger but it's simply not good enough to be priced at $32.

2.0,4/1/2013,Came here to try the DB Burger which is foie gras wrapped in short rib wrapped in sirloin with some truffle oil. So I iniitially didn't really want to drop $36 bucks on burger and fries but after eating this burger it just confirmed my gut feeling. Firstly...burger is piled way too high and it's just super tiny. I get that foie gras is expensive and maybe they can say that they use premium meat or something...but for $36 bucks I can get a much better tasting burger elsewhere....plus the amount of foie gras they give you is so small that you can't taste it when taking a combined bite that has all the other meats surrounding it. I actually had to just lay my burger on the side to poke at the minuscule bit foie gras with my fork to gather the taste. Plus certain parts of my burger had way too much horseradish sauce in it. They give it to you on the side so was not expecting a huge swab of it already placed in my burger...so kind of burned my nose.I think the only redeeeming part of this meal was the Olivier's Alsatian tarte flambée that we ordered. This is kind of like a pizza and overall tasted awesome! Definitely get this if you are here.Service was really good and the decor is nice....it's just...this burger was so dissapointing.

When my partner questioned the pour, as she is in the restaurant business herself, Mr. Personality only had one thing to say, ""that's it"".

It was complemented perfectly with the lettuce and tomatoes. The seasoning of the burger was good and the portion was decent sized. It was a pretty pricey burger and service was average at best.

I had to go for the classic, Cripsy duck confit - amazingly crispy skin and the confit, rich, flavourful and well seasoned, the Savoy Cabbage (nice and tart), Wild Mushrooms (earthy and sweet), Bosc Pears andSweet & Sour Duck Jus (rich, balanced, maybe a touch salty).  This was a very, very well done duck confit.",0,0,0,Adrian K.,"Chicago, IL",11,56,0

The flavor of the marmalade definitely complemented the torchon, though.]* THE ORIGINAL db BURGER - $32            - [4/5 - I don't understand why there's so much hate towards this burger. I had such low expectations coming here that the first juicy bite took me by surprise. I'll be honest, it was a little hard to eat at first because they really did include a giant chunk of sirloin and trying to fit the whole thing in my mouth was a bit awkward, but the flavor was just so good we eventually made it work. The foie gras was stuffed inside the patty and added a rich creaminess to the already juicy meat. The parmesan bun was also rather delicious. The kitchen was kind enough to put the burger on two separate plates for us. We were given a side of fries as well as ketchup, dijon, and a mayo for our burgers. Honestly, I was expecting the fries to be seasoned a little more, or at least an additional sauce to have been provided - like a homemade aioli or something. Either way, the burger was what we came for and it was definitely the star.]* BANANA RUM CREME BRULEE - $12            - [4/5 - Delicious! Not your traditional creme brulee (see picture).

This restaurant is a place does just fine for a special brunch or dinner outing.  And with lighting so good it'll make a powdered forehead give off a glare, it's by far one of the best in which to take pictures of your food (which is nice, because it's all presented with such finesse). Granted, you'll probably be judged just a little by the servers for doing so. Me, I was quite unabashed. Enjoy the luxurious food that could be best described as upscale comfort dishes gorgeously presented that don't necessarily alienate tentative palettes but add enough dashes of French flair to make you feel indulgent. The pork belly with a sunny side up egg was delightfully filling with its bed of polenta and the toast points are a great addition of texture. The crispy duck confit is moist and succulent with very bougy onion rings. Bougy, I believe, is the appropriate food term? To start I also had the fruit parfait, serving as a nice refresher. Ask the servers for their suggested wine pairings and they'll be more than happy to oblige.The minus one is not because of price (you better know that your cheapskate tendencies are not welcomed here and that you're dropping a decent amount of dough) but because of stuffy service.

The tart was whatever, but the mushroom bisque was pretty good. Granted, I could have maybe made this at home, it was still above par :)-Entree: skate and braised beef. The skate tasted as it should-- it's generally a chewier and tougher meet than regular fish. The braised beef was REALLY good. Yes, it was a tiny portion and yes, beef was only 50% of the actual entree, I thought that it was still delicious. It was cooked so that the meat would fall apart easily (you can even use your fork to cut it) and it was laid on a bed of veggies and (sweet potato?) sauce.-Dessert: sad to say, but the dessert stole the show. We got the cheese plate and the chocolate platter. The cheese plate consisted of two cheeses: bleu cheese and brie cheese (being a cheese person, these are probably two of the cheaper cheeses that the restaurant could have put) and, with the cheese plate, there were 2 slices of raisin bread.

That's how I ended up at DB Bistro Moderne for a Saturday lunch with my second cousins. I would have been fine with standard brunch fare, but this place is truly on another level. I figured I might as well go big, since I wasn't going home. Steak it was!Perfectly cooked for my taste (medium) and already sliced, this was a fantastic piece of meat. It was served with some potatoes that were made to look like bones and marrow, and they were no less delicious. My girlfriend -- oops, I mean fiance! -- had fish, and it was also excellent. I'd love to come back sometime to try the burger, which in person looked just as outrageous (in a good way) as the pictures you see above. The chocolate tart dessert was a lovely way to finish the meal and left me happy and full.Thanks, DB!Sincerely,JN",3,1,5,Jonathan N.,"New Orleans, LA",1470,258,53
3.0,1/19/2013,"This place has sooo much buzz about it, and I'm not quite sure why.I have heard their burger is fabulous, but I did not get that. My Dad and I went together on a recent trip and as always had a hard time getting a reservation. I was so excited to go as a foodie. We started off with the Pate, which was sooo mediocre - very disappointing. I ordered the cod, which I thought was quite good, but nothing to rave about. My father got the prix fix menu, and had a selection of mediocre - good food at best. The dessert he had looked and tasted like a kit kat bar, which came with the worst petit fours I have probably ever had. To top it off, the service was fair. I felt like it took forever to see our waiter, could never get a water refill, and had to flag him down when we wanted our check.Meh, I don't know what the fuss is all about here.",0,0,0,Scott J.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,176,94
4.0,1/7/2013,"Bistro Moderne is quite the classy establishment offering a refined experience based on both food and atmosphere. The dining room was decorated in a clean and contemporary way and the food presented in much the same way. We started with the foie gras appetizer which was extremely delicious paired with nice slices of brioche toast. My only issue with this was that for the $24 price tag, I was surprised by the small portion. Next we ordered the duck with root vegetables, cooked beautifully! I recommend this dish, yet wish there was more vegetables on the plate...but I guess they were going for a ""delicate"" presentation. The lobster salad was refreshing and mixed mango with presto and mustard dressing, which I wouldn't expect to taste great together, but it did. Dessert looked like art work! We tried the apple dessert and la lune chocolate dessert. Both really good choices! This is a splurge restaurant, but the food delivers!",2,0,0,Nicole B.,"Boston, MA",281,289,293
3.0,1/3/2013,"4/21/12Giving this place 3 stars because 1 is for atrocious.  2 is for edible food and mediocre service and 3 stars is reserved, in my opinion, for the middle ground.  Which this place is.  It doesn't quite make the 4 star list because while the food was delicious, I have no complaints (although i did come down with a bad bout of tummy ills by 11am the next day and was in bed after that. but I'll chalk that up to a virus and that it had NOTHING to do with my dining experience or their food.  you tell me.  i'm still not sure) with that - the service - while friendly - was not as attentive as you would expect.  The food ain't cheap.  That's a fact.  But you go there for ambience and to dine among a less chaotic and higher clientele.  The area is in the center of it all, so the day I went, at lunchtime - the place was hoppin', with business folk and tourists alike.  It is, after all, in the middle of the fashion and theatre district of New York City.My guest had a soup and then the famed (aka ""expensive"") dB burger and thought it was dee-lish!  I ordered an arugula salad and then had salmon tartar.  I was nervous about the tartar part - because, a.) i don't claim to really eat/enjoy too much seafood; and b.) i get weirded out by raw anything especially seafood.  But that doesn't stop me.  It was delicious!We ended the lunch with a plate of warmed Madelines that we shared.  That was a perfect dessert with a cup of coffee.The ambience seemed very loud and not terribly cozy.  Sometimes I felt like I was smack dab in the middle of the conversation of the folks seated at the table next to us.I wouldn't return just because it wasn't stand-out for either any menu items that I was hoping to get attached to or even the ambience.  It seems hip and cool for a drink with friends at night.  It's definitely ""Moderne"" and ""Chic"".  Delicious food.  The Atmosphere is a miss for me.",0,0,0,NoCooking R.,"Manhattan, NY",7,58,4

The taping finished a lot sooner than I though and I had lots of time on my hands before my 2pm reservation, I arrived at 12:30 and asked if I could move up my time and they were very accommodating and I was told that the communal table was available which was fine for me as they were packed. The server was pleasant; I looked over the menu and placed my order. First up a nice Amuse Bouche of Fried Risotto Balls with mushrooms (Daniel must be on a risotto high as I have had this in several of his restaurants in the last few weeks). I was the served my appetizer of BEET CURED SALMON with Lettuce Coulis, Pumpernickel Bread and Shaved Candy Beets, I was not sure of this when it was placed in front of me but soon realized I was in for a treat. The beets were nice and firm yet tender and the Salmon which is served raw was full of flavor (it was served in strips, I would have preferred it cubed) it was a nice balance of flavor...BRAVO. By this point in the meal I am now joined at the table by three rude, cheap women who had given the hostess a hard way to go because they didn't have a reservation and wanted a table, she stood her ground and it was nice to see her not let them walk all over her. Then my entrée arrived CHICKEN FRICASSÉE FORESTIÈRE with White Button Mushrooms, Pearl Onions, Wilted Spinach Spetzle Pasta... my feeling about this dish are mixed, I liked the chicken and felt that the Spetzle was over cooked and a little mushy, needless to say I would not order this again  as I prefer white meat to legs and thighs. The dessert made up for the entrée, I ordered the CHOCOLATE BROWNIE with Vanilla Custard, Morello Cherry Compote and  Malted Milk Ice Cream, this dessert was so good it almost made up for the rude women at one end of the table and the messy kids at the other. The cherry compote was the best part of this dish, after that first cherry burst in my mouth I needed a minute to pull myself together, as I felt myself wiping the drool from the side of my mouth I took my time to finish this. Overall this is a place I will come back to with a friend or two and get a table, and later in the evening ,hopefully the people sitting next to me will have a bit more class and I still don't understand why parents feel the need to bring young children to this kind of restaurant, no kids menu, no coloring books or kid activities, the children are bored and often act up while the parents don't care as long as they can get through that second glass of wine as is good to them in the end.",0,0,0,Rrichard H.,"Manhattan, NY",6,14,0

However, having eaten at Cafe Boulud, with its Michelin star rating, DB Bistro Moderne was a bit disappointing. I'll explain.We were seated in the lounge area, which was comfy. The staff was friendly, attentive and professional. We were referred to as Monsieur and Madame. The first items you're served are bread, breadsticks and a few dips, which included chickpea and olive. The bread was quite good, especially the pretzel bread.For our appetizer, we shared the Grilled Escargot Brochette (Glazed Chicken Oyster, Black Radish, Hazelnut Button Mushrooms, Parsley). This was probably the best thing we ate all night. If you're not a fan of escargot, or have never had escargot, this dish will turn you into a fan.

She found the Coq au Vin to be dry and salty, tho I just found it to be dry. The burger was a Sirloin Burger Filled with Braised Short Ribs, Foie Gras and Black Truffle, Served on a Parmesan Bun. It was good, but as with the haute burger that is served at the Minetta Tavern, I guess the burger served here had also been hyped up a bit too much. It was good, but worth $32? I don't think so. It had a good sirloin taste, but the amount of short rib was so small that it got lost. The fois gras was a very pungent flavor and tended to be a bit overpowering. It was easy for the short ribs to get lots with all of the sirloin and fois gras. I'm also not sure that I tasted any of the truffles. I'd probably have to say that of all the upscale burgers I've had in NYC (Minetta Tavern, db Bistro, 21 Club), the one at db Bistro is probably my least favorite. Actually, if you want to have a really good burger, just go to Five Napkin Burger! The best thing about the burger was the fries that came with it. Those were really good fries - some of the best ever.We also spoke a little bit with the group of women sitting next to us, who agreed the food was decent, but not great. They had ordered one of the specials that night, which had been pasta with razor clams. My gf and I had thought about it, but opted not to have that dish and perhaps it was good that we didn't. One of the ladies told us that the clams in her dish were still filled with silt, one of which was so bad that the dish had to be sent back.We opted to skip dessert and only drank water, so our bill, with the Savored discount, was very reasonable. They initially forgot to apply the discount, but once we brought that to their attention, everything was quickly fixed.db Bistro Moderne was, as Yelp's three star rating signifies, A-OK, but nothing more and far from exceptional. Now that I've had the burger, I'm not sure there's any reason to come back here.",0,0,0,John-Paul P.,"Madison, NJ",68,149,839
3.0,8/4/2012,"The burger here is true food porn, in every way imaginable - it even looks like porn (yelp.com/biz_photos/R15b…).For $32, you get a smallish burger, but it is stuffed with a couple cubes of foie gras and some braised short ribs. It is pretty delicious, but $32? I would much rather they get rid of the foie gras so they could charge a lot less for it. You can barely detect the foie gras anyway, since there is so much going on with the delicious short ribs and the parmesan bun.I got it medium rare, the way they recommend it being served. This is not a good recommendation. I don't mind a slightly bloody burger if the meat is high quality, which it is here, but the problem with getting this burger cooked so bloody is that it made the bottom bun completely soggy and ruined. By the time I was finished (which was very fast since I inhale my food), the bottom bun was almost completely disintegrated, which was pretty unpleasant. My wife got her burger medium well, which looked like a much better option in this case (if you want a rare burger done perfectly, try the lamb burger at The Breslin, which is served on a delicious and more sturdy bun that can hold up to all of the juices running out of the meat).The fries tasted like fancy McDonald's, which is always good, but they weren't nearly hot enough.The burger is definitely the only reason to really come here, but let's discuss the rest of the stuff while we're at it: the complimentary bread is weak, don't bother wasting yourself on it. It is not hot or even warm, and is not soft or very flavorful at all. For dessert, somehow they said they didn't have the Peanut and Banana Napoleon, which looks really good, so we got the Profiteroles instead. These were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.The place is located in a hotel, and it has a very nice, classy atmosphere. The service was actually pretty good too.If you are a true burger fan or can appreciate a good over the top burger, you should definitely come here to at least once to try the burger. Other than that, this place is a little pricy and is probably not worth the trip.",4,1,1,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
4.0,8/1/2012,"Gluttony has never been so good! I visited DB Bistro for Restaurant Week, and the RW choices were great, but  as the old saying goes, when in Rome, eat the short rib burger stuffed with foie grois and truffles. So, being a light eater and an all around modest guy, I created a 4 course Restaurant Week menu:  tomato gazpacho for an appetizer (fresh and refreshing), house made parsley fettuccine for the main course and  a burger intermezzo. Oh yeah, and a decadent brownie dessert. I skipped the cappuccino though - watching my weight.  What can I say about the burger that has not already been said? It's heaven on a plate. It's worth dealing with Times Square for.  Even when the Elmos are out.  Ground sirloin stuffed with short rib, stuffed  with foie grois, stuffed with truffles. It's an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in liver.  It's like a turducken on crack. The service was great too, and even made my french fries extra crispy.  Go here.  Try the burger.

1.0,7/27/2012,"Since this was a Daniel Boulud's restaurant, I had high expectation. And they were shattered into pieces upon dining here. So my family came here to celebrate our seven years living in NYC, while also taking advance of their RW. Understandably that  they didnt offer burgers, which is what they are famous for. But for the caliber of the restaurant, I still expect the food to be gd. Mom took the whole week off, and it was our fault that two of our three party didnt look the part of the restaurant, aka business people. But is that valid ground to give us terrible service? I don't think so. They never once came to our table to ask how the meal was going. We didn't order any drinks (it's just simple not a thing in our family) so our encounter with the waiter was very short and curt. Maybe I would have been swayed by their food. But alas, NO. Their food was beyond. mediocre. We had three people, so we pretty sampled everything offered on RW menu. Two out of three appetizer gained a WTF look from me. Only the corn soup was edible. Salad was super under dressed, no flavor whatsoever. Dont give me the ""oh it's just a salad"" crap because I have raved about salads I had from other places (fig&olive for example). Main courses: pasta was disgusting. Too heavy. The fish and the quail were the stars of this whole disaster, However, the couscous was too salty and buttery. Dessert was a-ok. Do not get that cheese platter thing. Bread was stale, hard to eat.

4.0,6/19/2012,"I had lunch at DB Bistro Moderne with my parents a few weeks back and came away impressed with the whole experience.Innocuously located on 44th between 5th and 6th, this restaurant is a classy joint with a touch of swank. Sporting some walls that are clad almost floor-to-ceiling in Louboutin-red art but otherwise affecting a minimalist, modernist aesthetic, you can dine here for business, family functions or even a classy date. Regardless of what brings you here, the food will not let you down.We all opted for the prix fixe, which consisted of an entree and a choice of an appetizer or a dessert. None of the appetizers looked overly tempting, so we all decided to save room for dessert. My father had the steak and eggs, which was perfectly good, my mother ordered a salmon dish that was fine, but my crispy duck confit was the type of dish that reminds you of the joys of French cooking. A fried duck breast, as crispy on the outside as it was tender on the inside, nestled atop a bed of crushed sunchokes, potatoes and wild mushrooms bathing in a duck jus, and crowned with a wreath of lightly battered and deep fried onion rings, this dish was every bit as aristocratic as it was peasant food, and executed so well that it was neither remotely oily nor heavy - very nicely done.For dessert my parents ordered the ice cream trio and profiteroles, which were all fine (the goats milk ice cream was very mild and refreshing), but I had my eye on the rhubarb creme brulee. I am not a big fan of creme brulee, but I am fond of rhubarb, so I decided to indulge. The brulee itself was very faint - it could not have been more than a millimeter or two thick - but the flan had a crumb crust that was very nice and texturally mixed well with the cooked rhubarb; it was almost closer to a crumble with custard than a traditional creme brulee. The scoop of almond ice cream that was served alongside was appropriately subtle yet well-defined and matched really well with the other flavors. I am of the expectation that the more a restaurant charges for food, the more I expect to enjoy the food, or, put another way, cheap is a tasty, tasty sauce and I rate pricier places with a higher bar. Many trendy places meet, but do not exceed expectations; however, even with entree prices hovering around $30, DBBM gets on quite nicely and serves a very good meal. For its class of restaurant it is definitely worth a return trip.",1,2,3,Mike K.,"Seattle, WA",89,147,91

5.0,6/10/2012,"I got invited to a brunch at DB Bistro Moderne, and let me say was I impressed from the second I walked in. The decor, delicious aromas, and great service was something that they definitely excelled in. We were sat in the back area, where we had our own corner, which was nice because we were out of the way. Their brunch cocktails were delicious! The menu had so many interested choices on it for brunch. I almost considered ordering the burger that they are famous for, but couldn't resist all the other choices. The menu was very french inspired, which I really liked! The menu was modern French combined with American flavors.To start, I ordered the lobster salad. This salad was packed with chunks of lobster on it, and had a very light dressing. I was impressed by the amount of lobster that this salad included, since most of the time I am very disappointed by the amount of lobster I receive in many lobster dishes. I probably could have eaten this salad as my main entree if I wanted to feel content, because the meat was definitely enough, but of course I had this only as a starter :) I loved the that it included hears of palm and also a very light pesto dressing. It was so refreshing! For my meal, I ordered the Crispy Duck Confit. It included wild mushrooms, crispy onions, and sweet and sour duck jus. It was definitely a very moist cut of duck. Also, the portion was a great size. The crispy shell added a nice touch of flavor to the already delicious duck! Also, let me say, the mushrooms, were sooooo good! The crispy shell and onions acted as a great surface to soak up the sauce :)One of my dining buddies ordered the Croque Moderne. This included duck confit on a sandwich with goat cheese and figs. It definitely looked delicious and was a very interested twist for a sandwich.One of my other dining partners ordered the Braised Berkshire pork belly. This included coco bean ragout, swiss chard, sun dried tomato, and a rosemary infused sauce. The dish was very tiny, but was very jam packed with flavor and moistness. I definitely welcomed a taste :) I actually had never had pork in this way before, since I am used to pulled pork. I loved it!For dessert, we went wild and ordered 3 desserts to share. The chocolate brownie with ice cream was a little disappointing I will admit, because the brownie was barely there. It was the thinnest brownie I have ever seem, and it was more cakey than brownie-like. But the ice cream that is came with was very good. I could have used some chocolate sauce though :(.The profiteroles were amazing. They were much better than I was expecting since I tend to not like these. They were actually the best profiteroles I have ever had! They were light, creamy, and very flavorful :)The madeleines were my favorite part of the dessert! They were warm, moist, dense, and had a delicious lemon and powdered sugar flavor. Ugh, I could have eaten the whole basket!!! What a delicious treat!I highly suggest this place! It is a great pre-theater spot since its isn't far from Times Square. We actually went to a Matinee after, so it was a perfect spot to dine beforehand. Otherwise, this place is a great spot for drinks, a date, brunch, or to try their famous burger, which I need to return for!",3,0,0,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

It was the best damn burger ive ever had in my life. Bar none, best damn hamburger at has ever had the pleasure of being digested in my belly. I think it took 4 days for it to fully digest, but it was worth every goddamn dollar. Cooked perfectly, with some fantastic fries. The lady friend ordered some sort of salmon tartar, I laughed at her order when it came, not because it looked bad, but because mine looked far superior. This lunch was fairly expensive, and well worth it on vacation, however, I doubt I would eat here regularly. I will get my hands on that burger again though, one day.

DB should not take the blame on that.  I'm not much of a dessert person, but it was very good.  Grapefruit Gateaux and ice cream.  Perhaps when I reach balla status, I can enjoy the $32 burger.",0,0,0,Jeff H.,"Queens, NY",52,23,3

As another over-priced, fancy-yet-potentially-underwhelming Midtown eatery, I never felt like giving this place a chance, but when a couple of friends cam to town and a reunion lunch close to the office was called for, I decided to give db a try. This place is definitely over-priced - entrees which can be found anywhere come at over $35 - but the Restaurant Week deal saved the day: $24 for a very nice salmon ceviche, pan-fried skate, and cheese platter (thank you French for having cheese and not dessert at the end of meals). Everything was properly done, and although the portions are small by American standards, over a 3-course meal they are quite appropriate.

4.0,1/8/2012,"Urbanspoon was our best friend on our recent trip to NYC. We felt that DB Bistro Moderne would give us a more traditional French experience vs the one next door (Triomphe Restaurant). With every restaurant I went to that was in this price range ~$200 for 2, I was always really surprised with how generous the portions are, this restaurant was no different, nice, perfect portions that left us leaving just right and not overly stuffed. I started off with the escargot & chicken oyster fricassee and she started off with the foie gras torchon. I really quite enjoyed my escargot, I've never had chicken oysters before, but I really quite enjoyed the taste and texture of it! I cannot comment on how the foie gras was but she said it was really good. For my main I had the crispy duck confit. I don't care how duck is done up, I always enjoy a duck dish (I guess that makes my opinion pretty biased about this dish, oh well). Can't remember what my friend had. Overall it felt like fine french dining, with all the small little plates they serve in between courses.

3.0,12/27/2011,"DB Bistro Moderne, one of many restaurants of the highly appraised chef Daniel Boulud, did not deliver as well as I expected. From outside of the restaurant, the place looked gorgeous. When I walked inside, however, it was just...eh. The decor was intimate with the red paint set up but the noise level quite didn't present it to be a romantic scene. Having come with my girlfriend, I guess I was expecting teeny bit more. Because there are two entrances (one from the street and one from the hotel), finding the waitstaff was a bit confusing for me since I'm used to having them come over first and ask if I have a reservation or not. Anyways, on to the food.After being seated in the back dining area, which in fact was more cozier and quiet, the waiter brought the pretzel sticks with basil pesto mayo and olive dip (?). It was a splendid starter and even though we had the breadbasket with butter and no appetizer, it was more than enough to get me and my partner's appetites going.Because I studied fellow yelpers' reviews of this place, I knew I had to get the burger for myself regardless of the mixed opinions. For my girlfriend, I decided to get the Coq Au Vin, a chicken dish with a dark broth that you mix spatzel (small pasta) with. For my review of the burger, I'm afraid that i have to agree with many of the negative comments. The outer part of the burger was a bit crusty and dry, hinting that it was previously made prior to my order. Of course, with such popular item on the menu it is expected but, come on... daniel boulud? However, the foie gras worked perfectly with the burger and so did the fries. Note: the wasabi mayo is very strong. you might want to mix that with the actual mayo they give you. Coq Au Vin, however, was a much better executed dish. It is a classical French dish and after stealing a few bites off my date, I really liked the dish. Even though it is a bit on the mellow and dark side, the dish was pretty good. The mushrooms were juicy and worked perfectly with the flavor of the chicken and the mixed pasta with the sauce was excellent as well.All in all, pretty good restaurant. However, I would probably not come back here with my date again with the average $32 burger and pretty good $29 coq au vin.

(Dish Rating 50%)yelp.com/user_local_phot…yelp.com/user_local_phot…Pretty good burger, but also one of the most disappointing.  Despite use of more elaborate and expensive ingredients, the balance of flavors were off and felt overall the execution was lacking.  Balance doesn't quite work, because the use of over-seasoned short-rib overwhelmed almost everything.  At times it seemed as if I was eating a short-rib sandwich instead of a burger, and the short-rib wasn't very good either.  I've had other burgers that used short rib much more effectively.  While the sirloin beef patty wasn't bad by itself, it was a tad muted in flavor.  Foie gras was excellent, but it wasn't evenly dispersed and the portion appeared to be more on the modest end.  If black truffle wasn't left out entirely, it's presence wasn't noticeably at all.There are some good elements to this burger.  The sirloin beef patty isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  Ordering the burger rare, the ends did come out with a noticeable char.  The beef appeared to be cooked consistently, with a good portion of the meat prepared nicely rare.  Texture of the beef was tender, but the flavor of the meat wasn't particularly high on flavor.  I do not feel a more subtle tasting beef patty like this can work with any condiments that are more robust condiments, which seemed to be the case here.  Juice levels of the beef patty were low, but it was also very low on grease as well.  Sauce of the short-rib was there in abundance, making it almost a messy burger.  The stuffed foie gras is by far the best part of the burger.  If it were just foie gras and the beef patty together, it would have been a much more satisfying dish.  The foie is stuffed inside the beef patty, instead of being placed on top of it.  The quality of the foie is good, quite juicy, soft, and delicate.  The flavor and texture blended well with the beef patty.  Unfortunately, the foie didn't appear dispersed evenly.  Biting into the burger, some bites will yield a good deal of foie, and those bites were the most satisfying.  Most other bites yielded much more of the poorly prepared shortrib, and those were lackluster.  If the burger had no-short rib, it would have worked much better.  Unfortunately the short-rib isn't easy to remove, being stuffed into the beef patty, as opposed to being placed on top. Horseradish mustard was a nice touch.  There was just enough of it to make add a subtle spicy kick to the burger.  I felt it was the second best condiment to the burger.Greens and onion were largely unessential.  There really wasn't enough of it to make a statement at all, especially against the other components of the burger.  It served the purpose of being nothing more than garnish.Bun used is a brioche like bread with poppy seed and onion.  The bread was more dense than I would have liked, and didn't seem to compress too much.  Given the larger quantity of beef, the meat to starch ratio didn't seem off balance.  This was a very filling burger.  It's already larger than your average gourmet burger.  It was heavier, given the foie & short-rib stuffed inside and the denser bun.  I imagine it could be shared by two adult.  It's not the best burger, but it is hearty and satisfying despite the shortcomings.Value is moderatly below average.  I don't mind paying $32 or more if it justifies the enjoyment of the burger, but here it fell short considerably.  ***Other thoughts***The terribly inept service, inappropriate even for a Denny's chain just didn't help at all.  It was without a doubt that the waiters who worked here were far from professional, often disappearing for 10-15 minutes at times, despite the restaurant never being over 1/5 full.  Working on some of the organization issues would really help.",3,1,1,Adrian Robert H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",720,350,1747

The portions were petite but we left the place miraculously full... off of the wine? It wasn't bad but it also didn't blow my mind. Only a few highlights for me - the complimentary pretzel bread (aka high class soft pretzel), warm mini madeleines for dessert, wine list, and the attentive service.Now onto the rest of the night - Although it was not a requirement, most of the gentlemen wore blazers to the restaurant. I felt a little out of place but luckily I'm a girl. The dinner started off with a couple of pretzel sticks with a pesto mayo type sauce and another one with olives? We then ordered our appetizers, the foie gras torchon and yellowfin tuna tartare. I liked the foie gras torchon only because of the toasted brioche. The foie gras was delectable but I didn't really care for the caramelized pineapple and lime candy strip. The underseasoned tartare was in dying need for salt and the minced vegetables on top tasted more like pico de gallo. Not very impressed so far until the pretzel bread came out. As for the entrées, I ordered the roasted monkfish. The dish came with two pieces of filet smaller than the size of my palm put together, a couple of lemony potatoes, and a tomato base sauce/broth. Not a great combination and lacking the depth of flavor any person would want from a good seafood dish. My friends ordered the Australian rack of lamb, hanger steak, and roasted Atlantic cod. We all agreed that the portions were really small for the price. The names of the dishes sounded quite simple but I personally felt like they used way too many ingredients. The one interesting food of the night (besides the pretzel bread) was the pommes soufflés. They look like your average steak fries, but they're actually airy inside. Basically two thin strips of potato were fried together to create a potato chip like side dish. It was definitely missing the heavy yet hearty carbohydrate texture. Oh, I regret not ordering the burger. Whomp.I wish I could say good things about their desserts but they weren't the best either. We ordered the peach melba, warm madeleines, fig & raspberry cheesecake, and the blueberry & brown butter tart. Perhaps, I like simpler dishes but again there were too many components in each dessert besides the madeleines. Maybe they should change their name to DB Bakery Moderne?The place itself feels more appropriate for a business dinner if you factor in the price, portions, and décor.

3.0,8/16/2011,"To sum up in the first sentence, I expected more from a Daniel Boulud restaurant.The service was very professional and efficient.  I was impressed.  The wine I ordered, a 2010 Piuze Chablis, was crisp, lean, minerally, and tart.  Perfect for a chablis, especially considering that over the last 10 years, many wines have been getting more alcoholic and tropical, due to warmer weather.  This one, however, was a classic.It went a little downhill from there.  The food was rather plain.  I had the smoked salmon with celery remoulade and horseradish sauce.  The remoulade and horseradish were too bland.  I have had much better with the classic red onion, hard-boiled egg, capers and creme fraiche combo.  I do like subtlely, but this wasn't subtle, just rather boring.The trofie pasta with veal ragout and favas and peas was:1.  very rich and concentrated, which is nice, but way too dry2.  too rich for the favas and peas, either get rid of them or lighten up the sauce3.  I've had a lot of trofie in my life, but never one that was wound this tight.  It was wound so tight, it looked like little earthworms, or worse, you know, insect larvae.  Maybe that's just me, but it was just -- weird.For a more common chef, this was passable.  But at this price point and for Daniel Boulud, it wasn't good enough.",3,0,0,Matt K.,"Philadelphia, PA",246,472,13

4.0,7/26/2011,"DB Bistro is really a first rate totally French food, rather smallish bistro with top quality service, a delightful menu and, considering where it is located and what it offers, high but not totally unreasonable prices. It's a favorite of the New York law firms to take their guests and clients for lunch. So, if it can satisfy them and they consider it good enough to impress their clients, you can be assured that it will most likely do the same for you. One caution about the place is that it is small and your chances of getting in during the noon hour lunch rush without a reservation might be slim. The wine list is extensive and one of the most well thought out of wine lists that I have ever come across.I particularly enjoy the superb preparation of their fish, though the portions are on the small side.For what ever reason, maybe because this is America, you'll find a good number of patrons order hamburgers. Why anyone would go to a French restaurant to order a hamburger, I haven't the faintest.

4.0,7/23/2011,"Perhaps you need a penis to truly appreciate DB moderne -- I say this only b/c on a recent trip, every man in the vicinity of our table felt the need to engage w/ each other abt the infamous DB burger -- made from a mound of short rib and stuffed w foie gras, this burger is a beast. Sadly, I didn't think that putting this behemoth in my body in 100+ degree heat was a perfect choice, so we stayed light and were not disappointed.Papa N and I both did the bibb lettuce salad and salmon or halibut -- all dishes were executed swiftly and in a clean manner -- flavors are solid but not mind blowingly interesting -- service is efficient.My inner fat child wanted to ask for 198347 more of the pretzel breadsticks, but instead I just went to for decontructed tiramisu for dessert -- a fine, but not outstanding choice -- the trio of sorbets is a better option.  For $168 pre-tip for 2 glasses of wine, salads, entrees, and dessert (in other words, standard New York pricing), you will have a strong, if not excellent, meal, but will it put you into a state of rapture?  No.  Will it fill you up well and get you out in time for a show?

Simply cannot go wrong.  (BTW, the online description of the burger leaves out the foie gras part because of all the PETA protests they've had but I guarantee it is in there.)  I'm also noticing that most of the other Yelpers skipped their chance at the Pommes Souffles, opting for the regular Frites instead and I will tell you right now that is a MISTAKE!  Pommes Souffles are something you must try with the burger, much more delicious than plain old fries though it's the same idea, fried potato slices.   I'd recommend skipping the cod, pretty boring preparation though well executed.  For dessert we ordered the peach melba and the waiter was nice enough to give us a Clafoutis Tout Chocolate (basically a molten lava cake, I don't care how overdone that dessert is, it's delicious!) and two glasses of a great dessert wine.  I will definitely be back, now that I've mastered the art of actually getting that giant burger into my mouth.  It's a must try if you haven't had it yet, just be sure to have the phone set for 911 in preparation for the heart attack that may accompany it.",0,0,0,Sue L.,"New York, NY",9,82,4

A must if you're in the mood for something light.-The Original DB Burger (Sirloin burger with truffle and foie gras): I was actually disappointed in this burger. The burger lacked flavor... even with the foie gras inside! The worst part of the lunch, the server. He was so snobby ever since we sat down and didnt order a glass of wine like the other patrons.

5.0,3/14/2011,"Waking early for a long jog and then hopping the LIRR to Penn by 7:00 a quick walk would place me at my first destination, DB Bistro Moderne, just after 8:00.  Too early for brunch but with eyes set squarely on one (or three) particular menu items I'll note here that my menu was pre-ordered by special request and as such from the moment I arrived until the moment I left the service was beyond reproach. With the city (and restaurant) quiet at such an early hour on the weekendI was greeted promptly and seated by one of the two server/hostess/bussers and with coffee (La Colombe) filled and remaining filled throughout the meal the experience was underway without me even having to look at a menu.Sipping my coffee while reading a complimentary copy of the New York Times and listening to soft French-pop overhead the entire feel of the room was decidedly haute-New York - elegant without being ""fancy"" and warm yet also stylish and modern.  With affluent Italians occupying a pair of tables next to me and conversing exclusively in their native tongues I made small talk with my server who noted the 1970s Kings jersey sitting at my side and shortly thereafter I was informed it would be ""no time"" before my first course would arrive.With the clock just shy of 8:20am and Boulud branded napkins and tableware awaiting my first course would indeed arrive from the kitchen quite quickly - a basket of three warm viennoiseries by Eric le coq, L'Echire butter direct from France, and two jams - rhubarb and raspberry by the famous ""jam fairy"" Christine Ferber.  With the butter croissant better than any I've had in Manhattan I can honestly say that it alone with the butter and delectable confitures would have been enough to justify the $6 price tag, but as an added bonus there was also a pain au chocolat stuffed full of Valrhona Manjari chocolate and a second croissant layered with strawberry jam and almond paste.  With each bite as good as the last if I had to utter a single complaint it would honestly be that the pastries were so good I could not find a place to use up all the lovely butter without feeling guilty.Noting my early meeting and clearly well prepared to have me in and out by 9:00am, my second course was special requested from the brunch menu and would arrive warm with cheese still bubbling.  Titled ""Le Menage a Trois"" - a taste of all three of db Bistro Moderne's Croques Monsieurs and featuring Croque Classique, Croque Provencal, and Croque Moderne along with a salad of mixed greens topped with a zesty vinaigrette this was the sort of breakfast worth going out of your way for.  With each half sandwich using toasted double buttered brioche and creamy Mornay, the Classique would be the most traditional - a savory ham, Swiss, and Bibb Lettuce composition that rivaled any I'd ever had.  More interesting but less successful, the vegetarian friendly Provencal would match a stunning heirloom tomato with fresh basil, mozzarella, and mesclun - the bitter greens proving an excellend balance to the sweet tomato.  The final sandwich - the piece de resistance if you will, would be the Moderne with supple and fatty duck confit topped with sharp goat cheese, fig compote, and spicy arugula - sweet, savory, fatty, and covered with Mornay...I'm pretty sure not even making the monsieur a madame could have improved it.With the time nearing 8:50 and the check delivered along with a to-go cup full of coffee I thanked my servers and made my way to the street where a quick walk would lead me to the Hilton by 9:10 - a full twenty minutes early.  A lovely setting, great service, fantastic food, and a kitchen willing to accommodate the diner's whim - after a great visit to Daniel in early 2010 and this visit to DB in 2011 there is little doubt that the rest of Chef Boulud's empire will find their way onto my itinerary during subsequent visits to the Big Apple.",1,0,0,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503

4.0,2/18/2011,"I came here a week after I had dinner at Cafe Boulud and while the food didn't disappoint, the whole experience wasn't as great as it had been the week prior. We came here specifically to try the short rib and foie gras filled burger, but also looked forward to tasting some of the other menu items.   The cocktail list is fairly limited but I was able to find something I liked. I didn't expect it to be bright red, but it matched the decor of the dining room perfectly! The only issue I had with the cocktail was the manner in which it was served. DB Bistro uses very small martini glasses and when they're charging $17 for a cocktail I guess they feel the need to fill it completely to the brim. The waiter poured it from the shaker into the glass at the table but filled it so much that I was unable to pick up the glass without the risk of spilling all over myself and the table. I ended up having to ""slurp"" a couple of sips with the glass still on the table. It was quite embarassing but I chalked it up to the waiter's misjudgement on how full the glass really was. The waiter saw me struggle with my first few sips so I figured he realized his error. I guess I was mistaken because when I ordered my second cocktail he did the exact same thing. My next disappointment was that our waiter never brought us our amuse bouche. We watched enviously as every other table around us received a teaser from the chef and kept thinking it would eventually be brought to us. We realized we were wrong when we received our appetizers.I started with oliviers alsatian tarte flambe, basically a very flat flatbread topped with bacon, cheese and onions. I enjoyed every bite of it but it would have been difficult not to considering bacon, cheese and caramelized onions are 3 of my favorite foods. My date had the orecchiette with venison ragout and he specifically mentioned just how fantastic the tomatoes in the dish were. We both ordered the DB burger and if this review was based solely on the taste of the burger it would earn 5 stars from me. The short rib and foie gras filling add so many rich flavors to the meat that it doesn't even need cheese (from the girl who loves cheese on EVERYTHING!)For dessert I had the hazelnut marjolaine gateaux and my date had the pumpkin canneloni. Both were spectacular, but I preferred mine, as it tasted like a rich, dressed up version of one of my favorite things in the world: Nutella!",0,0,0,Jen G.,"New York, NY",36,188,0

The fabulous hostess said she would try and work her magic and get us a table. VOILA, done. :) Perfect. I love the fact that they give you amuse bouche. EVERYWHERE should do this. Yummy little risotto ball, fresh breadsticks with olive tapenade and squash dip. Both were fab.I, of course, had to try this burger. I also go the butternut squash soup. It was really good. Velvety texture, hot, not too sweet. YUM. The burger, oh the burger. You know, I am not one to fall into trends but if people rave, it must me good, right? Um, yes. This was amazing. It was so juicy, I needed NO condiments. I always like to eat things the way chefs serve them. I feel they are intended to be eaten the way it is given to you. The fries were mediocre, I've had better, but NBD. Because this burger was oh so good. I suggest you try it at least once.

4.0,2/12/2011,"Visited this weekend with a two friends for dinner.  Seemed like they were a little confused about our reservation, but after a few minutes of bumbling we were led to our table. We ended up sharing the escargot and chicken oyster app., and two mains (must leave room for all the wine, cocktails, and dessert too!). The spetzle and mushrooms were delicious, and the escargot somewhere between good and very good. They tasted ever so slightly overcooked to me, but the dish overall was really tasty. Then out came the entrees--duck confit and the db burger. The duck confit was SO good that I literally had to stop myself from licking the plate. I did, however, end up dragging everything on the table (leftover bread, a few french fries etc) through the jus.  The db burger, despite the edition of short ribs was just good. The bread was almost the best part--all crispy and fatty, but the burger meat just didn't seem juicy enough to me. We still ate it all and enjoyed it, but I'd actually bypass the burger next time and go straight to the duck!To end the evening, the apple mille feuille and the citrus tartelette. Both delicious!! Although I could have definitely benefited from even more lemon curd on the tartlette plate. Yum!Oh, one more thing. Our server was very nice, but a little bit...abrupt? He seemed to jump around a bit, and shared the specials of the evening by walking up to the table, taking, and then walking away. Not a problem, just a little unusual! Overall, I'd head back..but I'd be sure to go for the truly good dishes rather than the flashy 'famous' ones like the burger.",0,0,0,Saskia S.,"NY, NY",82,302,11
4.0,2/6/2011,"Bistro Moderne is a solid sophisticated option if you're in the hustling area of Time Square / the Theater District / Grand Central. The menu has loads of interesting French food items, and all are executed beautifully. The restaurant is exactly what you'd expect it to be from its name - a modern bistro - with classic yet refined French dishes ranging from coq au vin to duck confit. I could have ordered anything on the menu. Most notable food items: duck confit, skate wing, and apple mille feuille. Everything was cooked beautifully. The service was very friendly and attentive.

2.0,1/30/2011,"Should have listened to the other 186 reviews on Yelp.Had dinner here for my anniversary recently and did not enjoy the experience due to mediocre service and o.k. food.  It took us an hour and fifteen minutes to get our entrees, though the wait did solicit an apology from the manager.  I expect the server actually forgot our order.  He had far too many tables (2 servers for ~20 tables in the front), and we experienced some trouble with his understanding the menu; he wasn't able to effectively give advice on what to choose and could barely pull out the specials.  Atmosphere is loudish but that's what you sign up for.  Altogether not that romantic in terms of decor or service.So, on the food...I had the famed burger stuffed with foie gras and short ribs.  I think they actually cooked it in separate pieces, resulting in a less-juicy center for the meat.  I found the taste of salt overpowering, though maybe I should have expected it given the foie gras.  My date had the cod; the fish was cooked reasonably well and I think altogether worth getting.  We shared fries and a mesclun salad but neither was worth a negative or positive mention.  Only had their 1/4 litres of wine - cab sav and a chateauneuf du pape.  Both were good choices!In short, I wouldn't recommend the restaurant for either the experience or the food.",1,0,0,Larry W.,"New York, NY",278,45,0

SERVICE: the waiter was great, did his job pretty well, answered questions, gave good recommendations, that's all they need to do. we also were having dinner before the theater and he made sure that all the food came out in time for us to eat and leave for the show.DECOR: It was a little stuffy because there were so many 40+ year old suits around. FOOD: we were served the pre theater menu, but i really wanted the escargot with chicken oysters, which they were able to serve us anyway without being listed on the menu. It was good. the escargot was not over cooked, which is easy to do when its cooked out of its shell. the chicken oysters were off the chain, super moist, juicy and crispy on the outside. the accompanied veg/pasta was good too. i ordered the scallops, and they were awesome. moist, not over cooked and seasoned lightly. the accompanied risotto was not so good, so i just avoided, it came with 3 scallops, wish there was more. there was the only down fall. my ""lover"" had the bacon wrapped salmon. it sounded great, but ended up not as good as its original appeal. it was over cooked and the bacon was overpowering the salmon flavor. For desert, the waiter recommended the cranberry tart. I love Pies and Tarts, and this was really good! it wasn't too sweet, just the right tart flavor and it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

3.0,1/3/2011,My friends and I ventured down here for a Christmas dinner that reminded us like the dinner scene in the movie Heat where everyone brought their significant others and enjoyed a fantastic meal.   We started off with their cocktails and I'm telling you the db Reviver and Passion Caipirinha tasted like gold.   Definitely get that and then slowly browse through their menu and I decided to go with the original db Burger for $32.  There is a slice of foie gras in the middle of this burger and since it cost more than the Minetta Tavern's black label burger i expected my first bite to be filled with an explosion of flavor that would surpass it.  What a disappointment.   It just didn't have the right balance of flavors.   Nice restaurant to take a significant other too but skip the overpriced burger.    The other dishes my friends had were executed properly and I would definitely come here again to try something else.A solid 3.5 stars,0,0,0,Tone E.,"Forest Hills, NY",203,198,1

Excellent squash flavor but nothing else, tasted like pureed squash with water and salt, no discernible stock or spices)Mixed Green Salad:  D (Amazingly poor for something that should be so simple for  a French restaurant to deliver ... Lots of unnecessary ingredients and insufficient dressing)The Burger:  C+ (Rich but bland and too salty, I suspect that the meat had not been aged at all and too much Foie Gras and short rib which for me is saying a lot since I love both ... My daughter and I both agreed that Houston's has a better burger hands down)Duck Confit:  C (Flavorless and poor texture ...

If it is no, I envy you and I sort of want you to feel my pain.After a three-hour car ride in (3 1/2 hours if you include parking), we had already missed our dinner reservation which was way down in the East Village (we were in Midtown). I was starving, grumpy, and carsick and on top of everything; my feet hurt. We were staying at Sofitel and I wanted to find something decent within walking distance--- preferably something not in Times Square (it gives me fucking panic attacks).We started walking and I saw the sign for DB Bistro Moderne. Like a glorious shining beacon of light shining down from the heavens, I barged in the front door like an angry maniac and stomped up to the Maitre d' demanding a table for two. Luckily he was able to squeeze us in, which didn't seem like a feat at the time because it was empty when we got there but within 10 minutes of being seated, it was COMPLETELY filled.I needed nourishment immediately. This meant it was appetizer time. We ordered the Oliviers Alsatian Tarte Flambee which was a crispy, charred flatbread with onions, ham and cheese. Great starter, not too filling. We were also presented with tiny parmesan breadsticks with olive tapenade and pesto. Cute.So, when I'm ravenously hungry I never want a delicate fish dish or ""something light"". I'm not your average girl. I want red meat. And I want my red meat stuffed with some more red meat and maybe a fattened goose (or duck) liver. Yeah. I'll take that.  Oh, and it comes with perfectly fried shoestring frites? Uh huh... sign me up. Once you get a hang of wrapping your mouth around this mammoth-sized epic burger masterpiece you will find yourself immersed in the sumptuous, melt-in-your-mouth trilogy of meaty glory.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?-Rack of Lamb - pretty much give me any lamb (baaa) and I'll eat it is how I feel about lamb, but this was savory and delicious with a great herbed crust, polenta gratinée with chanterelles and a thyme jus.-THE ORIGINAL DB BURGER - DO NOT DINE HERE WITHOUT GETTING THIS! It's a sirloin burger filled with braised short ribs (oh yes, OMG, a burger stuffed with short ribs, what??), which comes served on a parmesan bun with pommes frites.-Veal Picatta - don't bother, this was my choice and I was very disappointed.  The caper and raisin veal jus was fabulous, but there was barely any on it.  The veal was tough, too dry, and bland.  Sadly, it didn't even taste like veal.  I would've much rather preferred Osso Bucco or something fancier like that.

4.0,6/11/2010,"Daniel Boulud's midtown restaurant is overall excellent. The service is top-notch (they don't rush or linger, but ask the right questions and know the menu up and down) , the ambiance is well-conceived and the food execution is very good. The one downside is the lack of space and a buffer zone between parties and the noise level is a few decibels too high for dinner. On this trip, I went with the mesclun salad to start. The salad's house vinaigrette dressing consistency is the way all salad dressings should be modeled after.For my entree, i went with the world famous DB burger, stuffed with braised ribs and foie gras. It was simply one of the most memorable burgers i have ever had; Well, it better be for the $32 splurge. On the other hand, it was a bit over the top, though the medley of tastes in each bite was amazing. Each bite was something new, something exciting and delicious. The pommes frites on the side with three condiments was a nice complement.

I had chilled pea soup and bacon veiled salmon.   Salad and steak was fantastic.  Salmon was prepared perfectly.  All the vegetables were seasonal and delicious.  I didn't care for the pea soup much--tasted like pureed peas--really needed a texture or salty element to elevate it.  Portion sizes were small for the price (after getting out of our Broadway show at 9:30,  we both were a little hungry again).  We skipped dessert because we wanted to make sure to get to the theater on time.In summary, I would go back.  The food and service were good, but didn't blow me away.  Thankfully, though, there's nothing to complain about other than price and portion size (which might be typical for the area).",0,0,0,Areena M.,"Tualatin, OR",54,369,15

4.0,5/12/2010,"My dad had his heart set on going to a Daniel Boulud restaurant for his birthday, so I made reservations to take him to DB Bistro Moderne. When you first walk in, you realize that although this is Boulud's ""cheap"" restaurant, that the place is quite fancy. The acoustics are excellent. Even though the restaurant was absolutely packed, we were able to converse at our table and not hear awkward conversations of any of the other people seated near us. The average age of the clientele was a bit older - I was one of the youngest people there, aside from these little girls banging their knives on the table. The wine list is good - lots of quality French and Italian wine. The food is excellent! Even the bread that was brought to our table was great (go for the baguettes that taste like chewy pretzels, so good) and paired well with two different tapenades. For a starter, we ordered the Assiette Espagnole, which had enough iberico ham, squid, and chorizo for the table to share. For the main course, I had the special of the day, halibut in a light cream sauce. The fish was so fresh and dense, and did not require a lot of seasoning. I also tried one of my mom's ravioli, which melted in my mouth. You could definitely tell the pasta was made a few hours ago, tops. We also shared pomme frites for the table and they were crispy and not greasy. For dessert, I had the rhubarb three ways which was heaven on earth. My favorite was the poached rhubarb because it was very tangy, although the creme brulee was unique and the tart was phenomenal. I had a bite of strawberry shortcake, I would also recommend this. So, now that my dad has been sufficiently spoiled, he's been talking about going to the new Jean Georges restaurant at the Mark Hotel...at least I know that good taste is hereditary.",2,1,2,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

The menu was pretty great - there was the burger with foie gras, duck confit, a good selection of fish, and traditional-esque appetizers. To start, I had the mushroom soup which was pureed mushrooms and a dollop of cream. Unlike other mushroom soups I've had, this one was not too mushroom-y ... it was like Boulud knew exactly which mushrooms to blend together to make the flavor subtle. For the entree, I had the duck confit - I am a big fan of duck confit and this dish was no exception. The standout of the plate though was the orange sauce. It complemented the duck amazing!

Their children were young so they didn't have large appetites and for this reason alone our waiter was loud, obnoxious and dished out snarky remarks that were uncalled for and unprofessional.

Our waitress was very friendly, super informed and really just took care of us, even though we weren't nearly as dressed up as the rest of the clientele who seemed to be on a gigantic power lunch. My friend and I both got the Menu Bouchon (entree + app or dessert), this was the perfect amount of food because we split an appetizer and dessert between the two of us and each had an entree. For an appetizer we got the duck pate which was decadent and delicious, accented nicely by sweet cornichons and toasts. I ordered the braised beef with sauteed vegetables and a potato puree that was spot on, all very simple, nothing new, but done just right. The beef was fall-apart tender, the vegetables were garlicy and had just the right amount of crunch, and the buttery potatoes were drenched in juice from the beef, which made them spectacular. My friend ordered the panko crusted cod over linguine that was also wonderful and cooked perfectly though I could have used a bit more salt. For dessert, at our waitress' recommendation, we split a chocolate honey tart with poached pears and brown butter ice cream that was mind-bogglingly good. Seriously - mind-bogglingly. Also, the waitress, upon finding out that the chef I worked for used to work at Daniel, brought out a complimentary basket of warm, spongey, lemony madeleines dusted in powder sugar for us to nibble on and, upon seeing that we were about to burst, boxed them up so we could munch on them later as we meandered around the city.

It's hard not to salivate thinking about a burger made with braised short ribs and foie gras. Even the parmesan bun is nice and rich and full of flavor. I always take my time chewing to enjoy every flavor bursting out of each bite. The pomme frites complete the meal - crispy, tasty, and nothing too complex. Well worth the $32. Aside from the burger, I have also tried the organic chicken breast - and to be honest, I would rather go with something else. Although it was relatively tasty, it was nothing special and certainly not worth the price.

Not even close.  The dining room itself is attractive, but too crowded and the service tends to be awkward due to how tight they pack people in.  We had to wait a long time for service and the waiter knocked over the water jug one time.  The food itself is the main problem.  The famous DB burger is emblematic of the problem; reading about the dish induces salivation.  Foie Gras? Short Rib?  Sounds delicious.  But when you actually eat it, the flavors are not well distinguished and I wished I had the two separate instead so I could actually enjoy how tasty these two ingredients would be separately.  Ultimately, you end up eating it just to say you ate it, which is a poor reason in my (check)book.  Most of the dishes are like this; tasty on paper, but unsatisfying to actually eat.  Yes, I know they have an extensive menu beyond the burger; having tried a most of the appetizers and entrees, I have consistently been disappointed by the food.  For contrast, DBGB has superior tasting food, at a superior price.  In fact, for every dish I've had here, I think I mentally picture a similar but superior dish at a different place, and having that feeling all through dinner was a real downer.  I think time and money could be better spent elsewhere.",1,0,0,Shuo Y.,"San Francisco, CA",43,30,0

Because it was the middle of winter and this was my first real meal of the day, I went with the hearty cassoulet, my friend chose the coq au vin.  My cassoulet was exactly what I had hoped for, hot, heartly, and simmering with juicy cuts of lamb, several sausage links and duck confit.  The coq au vin was delicious and strangely complemented with an order of spaetzle, it couldn't have been more perfect.For dessert, we got the clafoutis tout chocolate (aka, lava cake) with two scoupes of ice cream.  We had substituted the chocolate sorbet for mascarpone ice cream.  I think they must have got something mixed up because seconds later they brought us another small dish with another scoop of mascarpone.  Score one for the staff!All in all, it was a lovely night and I would heartily recommend this choice to anyone.",2,0,1,John R.,"Alexandria, VA",155,197,48

When we walked in I felt underdressed in my jeans and Uggs but the staff and decor are so warm and inviting, that feeling melted away quickly.

The croissants and brioche were out of this world delicious. I have often been frustrated with croissants because I feel like a hot mess whenever I eat them, but I embraced the flaky exterior and dove right in.

3.0,1/9/2010,"So I came here for lunch right before New Years with my girlfriend, expecting great things. I am a big burger fan, and couldn't wait to try the burger - and I left severely disappointed.I ordered the burger; my girlfriend ordered the prix fixe, with country pate, braised flat iron steak, and the opera cake. We shared the pate, which was very meaty and exceptional, if a bit salty. Unfortunately, it took around 25 minutes for our pate to come out. While waiting, I ordered one of their drinks made with the hibiscus iced tea, and which was top notch. The entrees took almost as long to come out as well, probably in the realm of 20 minutes or so. Still, when it came, I was pumped.It's really a shame, because I read a few pages of Yelp reviews before I went there, and I had mostly dismissed everyone who found the burger underwhelming. I really, really wanted to like this burger. But in the end, I couldn't. Each individual component tasted great, but when put together it was just... a mess. It would be the food equivalent of Ocean's Twelve - a whole bunch of good-to-brilliant individual components that, when put together, equaled mediocrity. I'd give it a 6.5/10, but when you factor in the price and the fact that you could have a better burger for $6-10 (Five Guys or Ray's Hellburger in Arlington are both FAR superior), it's definitely a downer. The fries it came with were excellent, but no better than those at Five Guys, and really, you can only do so much with fries. My girlfriend's braised flat iron steak was very tender, but not particularly flavorful. For dessert, I ordered a three cheese sampling plate. The cheeses came with a fruit-laced bread, honey, and a chutney which I think was raisin and apricot, but a little hard to tell. It was excellent, and made me wish I had ordered the five cheese sampler to try the other two offerings as well. The opera cake was pretty good, with the espresso sorbet it came with tantalizingly good.It was a little hard for me to grade this place, because it did all of the small things exceptionally well, from the pate to the desserts to the drinks (the hibiscus iced tea is probably one of the greatest things I've ever drank), and the ambiance is very pleasant, and I enjoyed sitting there, even if it took forever for the food to come. That said, both the entrees underwhelmed and disappointed me, and left me feeling unsatisfied - especially when the bill came.3.5/5 stars, would recommend, but only tentatively.

Just re-reading the description of this bull market relic gets me salivating: it's a Sirloin Burger Filled with Braised Short Ribs & Foie Gras, served on a Parmesan Bun and Pommes Frites. It's not too big, nor too small - perfectly rich and delicious. And the fries are crisp and salty, exactly as they should be.

The richest burger I've ever tasted. Infused with foie gras, truffles, and French cheeses. This item is a little bit above your average Double-Double. Looking at the big picture, DB Bistro Moderne is a much more than adequate pre-Broadway French food destination. It's not as stuffy as other restaurants in midtown and the service is impeccable.Putting their burger against Pa's, well, he still reigns. Burgers are one of the few things he has perfected more than anyone else. If you strip down the $50 dollar burger to just a patty of meat in between two buns, Ron Swanson style, it tastes okay at best. Pa goes to a custom butcher to grind up prime sirloin and chuck. His burgers are bigger, more savory, and they don't need the pomp and circumstance to make them delicious.DB's burger is petite but filling.

The pasta was fresh and I really loved the hint of spice in the sauce. I then followed with the Crispy Duck Confit which was very tasty and crispy in all the right places. My company had the burger. I recommended it to him since I had read reviews before going and it seemed to be the common trend (and he's a simple eater). I don't care what level of Foodie you are, this burger is RICH.

My gnocci was perfectly cooked and the seasoning was awesome matched by interesting texture with celery and mushrooms. I know it sounds like a weird combination, but it was so good. My bf ordered the halibut and my bite was divine. I greatly enjoyed my overall experience but the cookie plate for dessert was less than impressive, especially in comparison to the rest of the meal.

DB closed at 10pm, the race was on!I arrived at 9:55pm and they gladly took me in. It was pretty empty that night with only a scattering of tables were filled. I ordered the DB burger with fries before they had a chance to hand me a menu. A minute later, I was brought a small plate of toast points with tapenade and a really good pate. I ate slowly for about 20 minutes, waiting for my burger, and when it came I was shocked!yelp.com/biz_photos/R15b…It was so small! I never took in the scale of the burger to the fries in other peoples' pictures. The burger was almost perfectly round and a bit smaller than a baseball. It was pre-cut to show off the intricacies of the innards, I wondered if they let it rest before slicing. The first half of the burger I ate as best I could, which proved to be trickier than I imagined. The burger ball was so tall that I had to squish it down just to get my jaw around it and the bun. On first bite, two flavors overwhelmed me; mustard and short rib. No burger flavor, and only a hint of foie going down. I messily downed the first half and decided on a new approach for half number two. yelp.com/biz_photos/R15b…I pulled out the sliver of foie from its short rib nest and ate it solo. Overcooked!!! No melty goodness, no satisfaction of force fed liver, just the bitter liver taste of livery defeat. Next I scooped out the short ribs and these were the highlight of the burger ball. Very tender and full of flavor, I wish they had a short rib sandwich. Lastly, I ate the burger. Again the mustard overpowered everything, so I scrapped it off and tried the meat alone. Although it was perfectly cooked, the meat was bland and devoid of all meaty flavor. The $32 burger let me down.

The DB Bistro Moderne has such a fantastic menu that we spend a good 15 to 20 minutes going over it; trying to decide what to eat as every time the server went by with food, we wanted to order whatever he was carrying.  The best part, and to help with the deciding factor, DB offers a great ""Price Fixe"" menu with a fantastic selection of appetizers, main course and dessert; which makes the deciding factor much easier.However, the specialty of the house is the original DB Burger - sirloin filled with braised short ribs and foie gras with pommes frites or pommes souffles.  Other orders made were the salmon, chicken and other selections.  We had two children in the group and the chef sent a chicken breast, sliced up and with pommes frites.  The kids were very happy... and a nice touch!I had the Coq Au Vin which is wild mushroom, bacon and spaetzle.  When I order mushrooms, I am always afraid they won't be fresh or canned.  However, my dish was delicious!  I could have eaten another one!  Even though I loved my selection, the burger was juicy, tasty and I wish I had one too.  A quick bite and taste of it left me with the desire for more... which means that I have to come back to eat one.Desserts were fresh, tasty and smooth; from the chocolate ecalir to the warm pistachio mousse were fantastic.  A great final touch to the evening with some fresh espressos and coffees to head out to the theater.The Final Verdict:Restaurant Ambiance/Decor:  4.5 out of 5.0Staff Service/friendliness:  5.0 out of 5.0Seating Arrangement/Layout:  3.0 out of 5.0Seating Comfort:  5.0 out of 5.0Food Quality/Flavor:  5.0 out of 5.0Wine/Alcohol Selection: 5.0 out of 5.0Wine/Alcohol Taste:  5.0 out of 5.0Bathrooms Cleanliness:  5.0 out of 5.0Price Value Overall:  4.5 out of 5.0Final Score:  42 out of 45  (93 out of 100% or A- Grade)Final Comment: A little bit on the pricey side if you include a bottle of wine, but every penny is worth it when you factor in the flavor, quality and taste of the food.  The few missing points is for tables too close and cramped .  A place to come to enjoy great food, great service and ambiance (minus the closeness of the tables!)",4,2,5,raul z.,"Huntington, NY",504,306,70
3.0,5/30/2009,"To be honest, I was happily surprised at the colorful, bright atmosphere, and the lack of over crowding. I always imagined this place as being dark and bar-like for some reason. (Perhaps because it is most well-known for its $32 burger?)  The service was pleasant also - attentive enough, but not overly so.The food?I ordered the 'Moroccan' tuna tartar and the foie gras appetizers.  I was disappointed with the tuna - it was of course fresh and good, but I was expecting something that would really pop!  In reality, it was just boring, topped with too-thick cream. The yellow sauce that accompanied it on the plate was decent, but didn't save it, which I just found all around disappointing as the description promises so much flavor and doesn't deliver. The foie gras was not even delicately presented - it was just a very large circular slab of foie gras set on a plate. Nothing exciting or inspired here, decent tasting foie gras that doesn't ascend.  The brioche that comes with it, however, was very good. For my main course I ordered the ""Escargot & Chicken Oyster Fricassée""  - the waitress was quick to explain I wouldn't like it if I didn't like escargot. Sure, that seems fair.  It comes with, supposedly,  hazelnut spaetzle and button mushrooms. In reality it came with spaetzle and roasted hazelnuts... noooot quite the same thing. I was expecting a delicately flavored and inventive spaetzle and was again disappointed. Also, I would have loved more than 2 or 3 mushrooms. I suppose the ""chicken oyster"" name is derived from oysters that are slightly breaded and fried. Ok. That was still tasty, as was the escargot. However, I would not order this dish again, as it quickly became bland - and the nuts in it detracted entirely.My friend of course got the DB burger and very much enjoyed it. He was happy as a clam.  I took a couple bites and found it decent, but not rave-worthy. I also told him to get the pommes soufflés - as you previous yelpers seemed impressed by them. Really, they are just air-filled chips shaped like puffy fries... hrm nothing special there. He was disappointed by the lack of substance, and I understand completely.Sorry guys. To each his own, eh?Dessert-wise we ordered the ""coffee tiramisu"", which was decent enough, but I really loved the flowery cream sauce that came on the plate, as well as the amazing ice cream and crunchy granola bits that also accompanied it.At least I can now mark this place off my list.",1,0,0,Valerie J.,"Sheboygan, WI",152,296,3312
4.0,5/27/2009,"I had an amazing meal at db bistro and would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  My meal started off with the peekytoe crab appetizer, which is the best dish I have ever had; it was beautifully presented, the crab tasted very fresh, and the grapefruit added a great sweetness to the dish.  My dining partner and I shared the escargot and chicken oyster fricassee, which was also delicious and skillfully prepared.  The duck confit I had was cooked beautifully.  The dessert I had was not as memorable and tasted too strongly of alcohol.  However, the petits fours were cute and flavorful.  I would highly recommend a visit!",1,0,1,T T.,"Cambridge, MA",0,297,327

4.0,5/12/2009,"I would never consider eating fattened goose liver.  Merely the idea of it repulses me, let alone the flavor.  Daniel, you shrewd son of a gun, you figured out the one and only way to make foie gras appetizing to me: load a bunch of short ribs and sirloin chuck around the outside of it and stick it into the middle of a toasted parmesan bun.  Somehow the foie gras is now 'reduced' to a textural enhancement.  This burger stands as one of the OGs whose genius is almost singlehandedly responsible for keeping the phrase 'gourmet burger' from being a laughable contradiction in terms.  To this I tip my hat.  To a $32 hamburger I tip the waitress enough to buy a non-gourmet heathenburger at the Corner Bistro, that's probably every bit as tasty.",2,3,3,Pablo H.,"Berkeley, CA",15,71,0
3.0,5/12/2009,"Daniel Boulud's burger at Bistro Moderne is finger-licking good. I'm a huge fan of a tasty gourmet burger, cooked to perfection like it is at db Bistro. The burger drips with succulent juices, and was seared with the perfect crust and red in the middle, which can always be botched when ordered medium rare.The burger is a sirloin-filled meat patty stuffed with braised short ribs and foie gras. And it's served on a Parmesan bun to boot, accompanied by pommes frites (or your choice of pommes soufflées). All good. But even though I'm salivating as I type the ingredients and recall the memory of eating the burger, I'm not convinced it is worth the $32. How about $25? Or $30 at least. Why the extra $2?My boyfriend had the pre-theater prix fixe, priced at $45 for a three-course meal. Since the boyfriend and I always struggle to find a good restaurant before the theater, we were happy to get a seat at one of their communal tables.And the service is great. We had a great server who joked, smiled and was engaging, tempered by a hot host who timed his flirting just right. All in all, a good meal.",1,0,1,Wilson A.,"New York, NY",22,39,1
5.0,5/10/2009,"In contrast to what some folks have said our experience was great!  DB had the best service of any place we've eaten in New York with a close 2nd being the River.  All the food and drink was good, but hats off to the dark chocolate and passion fruit ice cream they were absolutley delicious!",1,0,1,Kyle T.,"Normandy Park, WA",3,192,0
3.0,4/19/2009,"In shortOkay... so I'm a huge fan of Daniel, and figured this would definitely be a step down in some sense from his namesake at least service wise... but almost all points taken off are due to service..In long:We had a 7:00pm reservation for 6 people. We have a show that starts at 9:00pm. On the phone the Maitre'd said this wouldn't be a problem, and we could even show up a little earlier and they'd try to seat us.My group arrives at 6:45 and stand next to ""The Bar"" for 15 minutes, as people squeeze past us to try to get to the bathroom.

There's definitely too many textures and flavors going on to really enjoy it if you eat it like a typical burger. The Pommes Souffles were tasty, but made me wonder how the heck they make them!Duck Confit: Deliciously crispy and fattyWe finished up at 8:30, grabbed the check, almost double tipped as they included the 20%... which they definitely would not have gotten, so smart moves dbBM!",0,0,0,Andrew S.,"Hyde Park, NY",27,41,0

It's beautifully decorated and the staff is a bit snooty.  We started with the TOMATO TARTE TATIN. Now that was good. So fresh and flavorful. For my main course, I ordered the THE ORIGINAL db BURGER. It was delicious. I told them to cook it med since I don't like my meat bloody. It was amazing. Fries were good. Yes, it is a $32 burger, but man, it's worth a try and who knows when I would be back in NY again. I'm glad we went and the food was worth the price.

3.0,3/23/2009,"I went on St. Patrick's Day so the chaos on the streets, including a full parade of horses outside the restaurant, threatened to ruin lunch at DB. Thankfully it was quite the oasis inside. We both ordered from the prix fixe, he had the soup and I had the pate. The pate was good, but the lobster salad is better. A nice combination of greens, avocado, endive, and so on. Nothing tempting on the dessert menu though.There is a dearth of options in this area. One can only go to the Royalton or Koi or Haru so many times. DB at least adds some variety to the mix.",0,0,0,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",74,337,33
3.0,3/23/2009,"People's eyebrows raise when you mention you've gone here - not out of suspicion, but moreso in a 'oh-look-at-you-and-your-fancy-ways' kind of way.We visited at lunch on a rainy weekday and the host staff was disorganized;  checking our coats and then being guided to our table was an uncomfortable, comedic exercise.  Find someone who has a genuine sense of welcoming, grace, and conversational charm who can help guide people through this.Our waiter can best be described as arrogant.  It was everything I could muster not to strangle him.  He could have at least memorized the specials.Food and beverage:  I highly recommend the hibiscus iced tea.  Soup of the day was chestnut and celery root with just a dab of creme fraiche.  Amazing.  Simply beautiful.  The textures and tastes were perfect, and the soup bowls, adorned with roaring lions' heads, were a classy touch to the modern interior and place settings.We knew the burgers were legendary, but none of us made the effort to try.  The lamb tajine was absolutely delicious, and the braised flatiron steak with bourguignonne sauce was incredibly tender and simply melted on the tongue.  Visit the bathroom - I love the lighting and the clear green-glass tiles on the wall that show the textures of the grout underneath.  Very eye-pleasing.",0,1,0,Evan G.,"San Francisco, CA",221,732,365
3.0,3/19/2009,"Had the db Burger (no truffles) and the foie gras torchon.The torchon was good, but then again, it's foie gras.  The portion wasn't huge, but the price wasn't crazy either.  Decent.The burger is ridiculous.  Being aware that the most dangerous food to eat raw is ground beef, I typically don't like rare burgers, but I had to go for the suggested medium-rare on this one.The burger is shaped like a baseball, and is completely impractical to eat with your hands.  The inner portion is raw, like steak tartare.  It's stuffed with short ribs and foie gras.  To be honest, I could only taste the short ribs, which were good.  Was it worth $23?  Probably not.  Would I have felt like an idiot ordering the $75 truffled version or the $150 double-truffled version?  Absolutely.It's very close to the Times Square/Broadway circus, and feels a bit touristy as a result.It was fine, but nothing really special.",0,0,0,Bill C.,"Houston, TX",23,219,4
5.0,3/6/2009,"Barbara Walters endorses this review! (lol jp... but more on that later).It was a Wednesday night and my foodie friend and I just left the Garden after watching the Knicks defeat the Atlanta Hawks. We were feeling too good to go home, so we decided to embark on a foodie adventure. We chose db Bistro Moderne as our destination and away we went! Little did we know, not only would we experience one of the best burgers we've ever had, but we would also have the pleasure of sitting next to award-winning journalist and tv personality...Ms. Barbara Walters!!!She looked absolutely ""maavelous"" and was finishing up on dessert, so I didn't know if she had the db burger or not, but I figure ""if db Bistro Moderne is good enough for Barbara Walters, I'm sure it'll be good enough for me"" haha jp. Anyway, onto the restaurant...The decor of db Bistro Moderne is the most relaxed out of all the Daniel Boulud restaurants I've been to other than Bar Boulud. However, the interior design was still a nice contemporary touch, displaying intense red portraits in the casual front and floral photographs in the formal back dining room. There was also a wine bar that connected the two dining rooms, with a displayed bottle selection on the opposite wall from the bar.Seated in the back, the seating arrangement was a bit tight, but alas, it's called a bistro for a reason. Aside from sitting next to Barbara Walters on our right, we were lucky to be intimately seated next to a charming older couple from the UES on our left. We engaged in conversation, talked about a wide list of subjects - from Daniel Boulud, to exotic cuisines, college, and Broadway (they just came from the play ""Guys and Dolls""). The lady, at one point, even shared some of her pork chops with my foodie friend! (and a healthy piece at that! haha). That type of intimacy amongst guests is a byproduct of the tight seating arrangement, whether by design or not.Of course, my foodie friend and I both ordered the db burger (medium rare) - a sirloin burger stuffed with foie gras, braised short ribs, and black truffle with a parmesan crusted bun. Due to the amount of ingredients stuffed in the sirloin, I had to use my utensils to consume this tall burger (a rarity for me), but once in my mouth, this conglomerate of food created a wonderful sensation! The sirloin and braised short ribs were juicy and tasteful, while the foie gras added a rich, creamy texture. Midway through chewing, a burst of spice came about, prolonging the tasteful sensation! I assumed it was a mustard wasabi that was added with the foie gras. The parmesan bun was good, although I would have preferred a wider bun to help keep the infrastructure of the burger intact, as I eventually had difficulty keeping the burger in place; my only complaint.I had the Pommes Soufflées with my db burger - It was cooked so crisp, so light, and so thin; I wonder if it were angels that made them! It was an excellent side. My foodie friend had the Pommes Frites instead, and it was also crisp and tasteful.For dessert, we had the banana chocolate beignet with a slow roasted banana and peanut ice cream. Just... wow! Every part of the dessert complimented each other so well. The donut was placed on top of a layer of chocolate spread, with a sprinkle of sugar. The banana, also on top of the chocolate spread, went excellent with the peanut ice cream which was just subliminal! I'm not sure who the new pastry chef is, but bravo!The service was good, but could have been better. The staff wasn't as attentive compared to other Boulud establishments, but at the same time, I kept things in perspective and relative given the more relaxed and casual nature that is db Bistro Moderne. However, they were still professional, swift, and cordial. Just one complaint, they forgot to serve us our beverages we ordered and I had to remind them, but they humbly apologized and brought it to us right away. Mistakes happen, so no big deal. It was still a professional staff and brought our other courses to us promptly. We ended up having a nice short chat with our waiter about Barbara Walters and how this was her second time at DB Bistro Moderne and how she frequents Bar Boulud as well. Also, a headsup to other yelpers, according to our waiter, Daniel Boulud is opening another restaurant downtown, apparently called DB BG.To sum it up, I had a great dining experience at db Bistro Moderne. The db burger was everything I expected it to be, dessert was amazing, the atmosphere and ambiance was pleasant, and service was good overall. I would defintely come back. Hopefully Barbara Walters is there again and I can have the courage to say hello next time hehe.",0,0,0,Gary R.,"New York, NY",34,38,2
4.0,3/5/2009,"In New York for a week for fun (mostly) and met some friends here for dinner after the theater.  Its on 44th between 5th and 6th so very close to the Broadway shows.  Wow! This place was just outstanding! It was a Wednesday night at 10:30 when we got there and it had a nice little vibe going.  Its not a huge spot but was reasonably crowded.  The staff was really helpful and we got a nice table right in the middle of things.  Ordered a beet salad with goat cheese to start then the Sole as a main course.  It was served on top of some very delicious mashed potatoes.  Normally I try and stay away from that because its a bit on the fattening side but before I knew it, the Sole and the MP were gone and I was one happy dude!!! They have a fine and fairly reasonable wine list to compliment things.  Oh... and we had heard so much about the DB Burger that we ordered one for the table and split it 3 ways.  The burger and the accompanying fries, truly were remarkable.  This is a Daniel Boulud restaurant and for my friends in Orange Country, there is one in the Wynn Hotel in Vegas so you can sample some of this fair without having to travel too far.",0,0,0,Bill M.,"Dallas, TX",59,120,1
1.0,2/16/2009,"I live by Yelp, read reviews of every restaurant I visit, yet I seldom post about my dining experiences. However, I had a Valentine's dinner at D.B. Bistro Moderne last night that was so atrocious, I had to take the time to write about it.Valentines day is, as far as dining is concerned, a very important holiday. So I was very much looking forward to taking my fiancée somewhere we both had been wanting to go for years. We arrived a few minutes early for our dinner and were invited by the courteous staff to wait at the bar. A wait we did! After fifteen minutes with no server acknowledging us I had to go to the front and put our drink orders in with the hostess. Kind of embarrassing on what's supposed to be a very romantic night.Once our table was ready we sat down and met our server. At least, I think we met him. He didn't introduce himself, or smile or wish us happy valentines day - he abruptly asked if either one of us had any food allergies and if we wanted sparkling water, then left.The menu was broken down into a his and hers tasting menu. I got the his, she got the hers. The bread arrived and we loved it, there was a pretzel- thing, which we quickly gobbled up and asked our ponytailed server for more of. He said ""sure"" and then never came back. The first course arrived, she had the fois gras, and it was pretty good. I has lobster two ways and it was terrible. Clearly overcooked and a poorly designed dish. I should have sent it back, instead I asked our waiter about the pretzel bread again. He blew me off but motioned that it was coming.The second course arrived, she had a scallop over truffle risotto, she enjoyed it. I had a bite and I have to say it was good, not great, but a solid dish. I was given some sort of white fish rolled with spinach and sliced. It looked like the kind of thing wedding caterers throw in as a first course because it's cheap. Actually, it tasted a lot like wedding food, bad wedding food. The flavor was nonexistent, not what I'd expected from a restaurant with such a reputation. 0-2Now I ask the waiter for the pretzel bread again, because, well it was the best thing I'd tasted in two courses. He stops and tells me they're out of it and walks on away. Awesome customer service.  Third course, she had the veal and I had sirloin. Hers was ""mediocre at best"" in her words, and mine was absolutely terrible. There was a short rib on the plate, and it was great - I'll give them that, it was very well cooked, however, it was about 25% of the plate. The sirlon was tough, juiceless, flavorless and, well, just like food at a bad wedding. It was garnished with some poorly seasoned and unintentionally cold vegetables.I won't go into desert, there was some cake with ice cream, it was fine. At this point, it's like ""Did I just eat a meal at Bistro Moderne... or the Feltenstein-Henderson wedding at the Hoboken Hyatt? I really cannot express how poor the value was on this meal. I was visibly upset when the bill came. No one asked if we enjoyed ourselves, probably for the better anyway. In short, maybe BM has a great burger on a regular night, but the food they served (at $30 per course!!!) on valentine's day was insulting. For top dollar you expect an experience. Great food, maybe some décor and service that makes it a special night, we got none of that, just the bill.Oh, and the best part. They added 20% gratuity, so the check came to $414 for two of us, the bad dinner and three drinks each. No wonder the waiter didn't give a flying fuck that we were on one of our biggest dates of the year, he's getting his seventy bucks no matter what! Actually, if anyone from BM is reading this, the busboy was very nice and friendly all night, even when our waiter wasn't, he might have even wished us a happy valentines day. Will never go back here, will be happy to tell anyone that listens how lousy the meal was. Go to Raoul's for French bistro food that will always impress.",3,0,1,Chris H.,"New York, NY",0,12,0

3.0,1/4/2009,"3.5 starsSometime back, I saw raving reviews of DB's bistro burger avec foie gras et al and decided to have a go at this supposed best burger (then) in the city. Mind you, I'm not a huge burger fan but something about the description of this burger got me really curious. So the day we were catching The Producers along Broadway, I decided this could be a good time to check this place out for a pre-theatre meal. ooops did I forget to mention that it didn't occur to us to make a reservation? Fortunately for us, we were early, so the place was yet to be packed so we slid ourselves into one of the available tables. I didn't even look at the menu and ordered the infamous bistro burger. (OK I lied, I did peek at the menu to see what other offerings they had, but I was quite determined that the burger was what it will be for me). My girlfriend gave me a ""seemingly surprised"" look when I ordered that. It kinda implied ""Whoa I didn't know you were into burgers (for Dinner!)"" and kinda also implied ""Are you THAT hungry""? HAHA yea, I was that psyched about it that I truly went against all norms about what the fairer sex should and should not order for dinner (just kidding) that night. She ordered the quail and foie gras appetizer and was set.Although I did see other patrons have the burger, it still took me by surprise by the size of the patty when it arrived. OMG so much meat. The foie gras within is defintiely a novelty but the burger and fries were a little too much for me. Nevertheless, since I was paying good money for it, I made sure I finished it and what a feat that was. OK, the burger may be good, but since I hardly consider myself a burger fanatic and have till that point been more used to beef patties the size of McD's (hah!)... I have to admit that I actually enjoyed my friend's quail avec foie much better.

How distracting.I ordered the seabass which was pretty good. I liked the mushroom and sauce that came with it. My boyfriend got the burger. It was only ok for me.

4.0,12/22/2008,"I made a reservation here for a pre-christmas dinner, purely because of the following reasons:1) they had decent ratings on yelp!2) the association with Daniel3) I was able to get a table  for 8 during this time of the yearDue to the weather, holiday or whatever, most people couldn't make it to the dinner but 3 of us showed but as i called to change the reservation the maitree D was cool about it.The Food I give 3.5 STARS : I guess I haven't tried enough to fully experience the food here. The Nantucket Scallops, which can be ordered as an appetizer or a main course, was heavily recommended by the waiter more than the Diver Scallops. It had a delicious citrus sauce and was surprisingly  melt-in-your-mouth good.The french fries i got..even though served on a silver platter.....hmmm doesn't even come close to fries from Pommes frites or Mcdonalds LOLMy friend ordered the prix fix menu which came with an appetizer, main course and dessert. I think that would be a good deal if you're not going for the Fois Gras burger.Mont Blanc : I would order dessert elsewhere...once again I wasn't wowed, presentation was awesome thoughThe Service I give 5 stars : the waiter was very attentive, and made an awesome wine suggestion for us.( aka got us buzzed and very giddy)  We lingered around for 2 hours but we never felt rushed and everyone in the restaurant was extremely cordial.Decor and location : In a busy theater-Time square district, It a delight surprise to find such a calm and nice restaurant situated right on 5th ave and close to rockerfeller center and times square. Normally I would try to stay away from the busy areas but I took advantage during my visit to DB moderne , especially with the beautiful Christmas tree  at the Rockerfeller and the light show at the Saks 5th  i've been neglecting for many years!Happy holidays !!!!I will come again to try there other food",1,0,0,Isabel L.,"New York, NY",257,415,98

3.0,12/5/2008,"This is a review only for the dB burger. Which is basically what anyone seems to write about at this place. To be honest, I can see other menu items being much more enjoyable. Though, the fact that this place was so crowded did diminish the appeal to some degree. For such a nice restaurant, the atmosphere is a bit too hurried. So, without further ado, let's get going. Black truffle and foie gras on a burger. Sounds great, right? After all, the unctuous creaminess of foie gras and the earthy richness of truffles seem a natural complement to a savory burger. The idea of such a deep and richly satisfying taste experience is hard for anyone to resist, even at $32 a pop. The end result, however, is a bit lacking. While I'm a huge fan of the big patties at Corner Bistro and have no problem with my burgers being fall-apart tender, the form of these burgers ended up detracting from the overall experience. Stuffing the burger patty with foie gras made for two problems. First, the patty was too big to fit in your mouth. Second, the multiple, unhomogenized phases of ingredients made it difficult for you to enjoy the creation as a whole. Instead, you nibble for a bite of meat, then a little of the foie gras, then maybe a piece of bun. Before you know it, you've gnawed the whole thing apart and what's left is crumbling through your fingers. I think there's a lesson to be learned here. A burger is a perfect creation in its own right. We should love it unconditionally. There's no need to try to dress it up and make it be something it's not.",0,0,1,Manesh P.,"White Plains, NY",33,200,0
5.0,11/25/2008,"Though I have never been to Daniel, DB Bistro Moderne is a great look into the culinary genius of Daniel Boulud.  One thing to keep in mind when venturing to this palace of deliciousness is that it is much fancier and more expensive than you would imagine.  The atmosphere is quite stuffy and highbrow, but with food this good, I think it is worth the sacrifice!  While the service was attentive, it could have been more friendly.Now, let us get to the good stuff...the food!  The Atlantic Cod entree was boldly crusted with brandade and bacon.  The leek fondue and cockle broth and a fresh contrast to the smokey bacon flavor.  I decided on this entree based on the quick recommendation from our waiter and was not disappointed.  The db Burger was a massive patty of top sirloin stuffed with Braised Short Rib, Foie Gras, and Black Truffle.  It was pure decadence.  The rich, meaty flavors melted in your mouth.  The accompanying French fries were crisp and addicting.  For dessert, we again followed the waiter we ordered the seasonal Blueberry Tart, which was accompanied by candy corn ice cream.  The blueberries were plump and sweet.  Swallowing a spoonful of the candy corn ice cream was like eating a handful of candied pecans.  The flavor was so precise, it was completely shocking.  Also, the blueberry and nut flavors created a surprisingly tasty blend.db Bistro is a great option for special occasion and/or Theater District dining.",1,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
2.0,11/9/2008,"I have been here many times and always enjoyed their interesting $32 hamburger and good service. Last night I took my father there as a treat and  it was a pretty horrid experience. We sat in the back where they have crammed in one table too many and I don't think we went a full 60 seconds without a waiter or bus boy reaching over our table to put something down, pick something up or pour drinks. It was intrusive and calustraphobic to the point that we asked them if we could pour our own drinks. To add insult to injury the burgers that we ordered Medium Rare were delivered by the runner as Medium. When we challenged the waiter he assured us they were Medium Rare. They were in fact closer to Medium Well.

3.0,11/2/2008,"Been here twice now and I think its a 3.5 star place but I'm rounding down cause of the disappointment of the burger. The burger does not taste special to justify the price and the bun is so tiny everything falls out. Neither of us thought much of it..I'd rather have Shack Shack or In-n-Out and just order something else. To be fair the crab appetizer is quite tasty and fresh and the seafood paella was good but there was barely any rice..a rather essential component of paella. I also tried some pasta dish for restaurant week and was not impressed...I think my coworker ordered it when we went for a normal lunch and it looked a lot better. Perhaps they skimped for RW?It has nice ambiance, decent service, and is pricey but not ridiculous.

2.0,8/21/2008,"Food - 4 starsAmbiance - 4 starsService - 1 starI thoroughly enjoyed my meal of fois gras burger and fries.  The meat was flavorful and juicy and appropriately indulgent.  The fries were just a tad on the crispier side.  Ambiance was modern and minimalist with comfortable seating.   That ended when the wait staff rushed us out on an un-crowded Wednesday night.  Normally when I tell a person that I'm still working on my food he'll leave my plate.  However my waiter/busboy decided to dissect my dish by removing my fries from the dish (it's not that disgusting, the fries were in a separate compartment).  The only problem with that was my sauce was on the plate that they took away.  Not wanting to make a scene, I used the communal sauce on the table, only to have that taken away seconds afterwards in their second round of cleaning.  Needless to say I was disappointed at their lack of awareness to the customer.  It seemed to me that they were so focused on clearing the table that they didn't hear a word I said and were unaware of the obvious food on the plate.  In the end, the food was not good enough to make me want to go back given the dismal service.",5,0,1,Ufei C.,"New York, NY",22,48,1
3.0,8/6/2008,"A few co-workers and I decided to treat ourselves to a Restaurant Week lunch. The idea of a 3 course meal prepared (or at least conceptualized) by Daniel Boulud for just $24.07 appealed to both our palates and our wallets. I perused the menu, carefully weighing my options for each course.  When the waitress appeared, I looked up at her and smiled, ready to indicate which of the proffered dishes I had chosen. I opened my mouth to speak, but nothing came out.  I paused, puzzled; then I tried again. ""I'll have the..."" was all I could say, and then my voice failed me. I glanced around the table at my collegues, embarrassed and bewildered. I turned back to the waitress, shrugged helplessly and opened the menu to show her my selections.  As I started to point toward an appetizer, I felt a powerful rumbling in my stomach, a relentless force that would stop at nothing. Suddenly the words erupted out of my mouth, completely of their own volition. ""BISTRO BURGER!"" I shouted.  The patrons at the surrounding tables turned at the commotion, and my lunch companions hid their faces behind their menus. Humiliated by my utter helplessness in the face of my stomach's wrath, I recognized the futility of further resistance. Resigned to my fate, I sighed, ""Medium rare, please.""And so it came to pass, on a seemingly ordinary Friday in late July, I, Peter D., ate a $32 burger.

B ordered a nice bottle of wine to start and we both really enjoyed everything that we ordered.  We started with an interesting starter dish -- Escargot & chicken oyster fricassee w/ hazelnut spaetzle and mushrooms, a combination too intriguing to pass up (tough but chose that over the foie gras torchon).  For my main meal, I had the crispy duck confit served w/ mushrooms, broccoli rabe in a sweet & sour duck jus -- rich, decadent, and delicious.  B ordered the roasted halibut w/ fava beans and spring onions... a nice piece of fish perfectly cooked.  Not as flavorful as the duck but not sure there's much on the menu that would've been as flavorful (except for the famous burger... which i do want to try one of these days when i'm feeling totally extravagant and/or crazy enough to spend $30+ on a burger).As we finished our meal, I was thinking that this place totally deserves 5 stars.  But why only 3... well, both B and I suffered from food poisoning after we ate here!  Yep, from a Daniel Boulud restaurant... WTF?!?!  I will not go into details here but it was painful for both of us.  It struck me first, then the exact same symptoms hit B about 12 hours later.  Not sure exactly what it was that we ate since we shared pretty much everything... could've been the fish, duck, chicken, who knows!  So beware.  The food, service, and ambiance were all great... but I dare not go back here after the night I suffered from the food poisoning.",6,1,3,camilla c.,"New York, NY",171,336,1

If you're a fan of French wines and are in the neighborhood, at least stop in the bar for a glass or two. Service was professional without being pretentious. A note on expectations: Because it was jam packed, it was a little noisy at times (typical bistro style), so if you're going for a romantic night out with peace and quiet, this might not be the place for you. I personally felt this added to the charm and appeal, but would say db is more suited for groups or a fun dinner out. More hip and festive than romantic.

DB bistro did not disappoint.  For appetizer, I had the Olivier's Alsatian Flammenkche which was like a really flat pizza with fromage blanc, bacon, onions.  I had one in Strasbourg, France and this was quite comparable.  My friend order the lobster bisque which was so delicious.  It wasn't creamy at all and it tasted like they stew a dozen lobster in that bowl.  For entree, I had the DB Burger which had fois gras, braise short ribs inside a burger with parmesan buns and pomme frites.  It was the best burger I ever had and most caloric.  It was also the most expensive considering it was $35 for a burger.  My friend order smoke salmon appetizer for his entree and that was quite satisfactory.We shared a poached pear dessert which was so delicious.  They had hibiscus ice tea which was very refreshing considering how heavy our food was.The whole meal for 2 came to be +100 with tip and tax.  I also love it so much I came back for breakfast with my uncle the next day.  I had the poach eggs with cappuccino.  So yummy.  It was also expensive since breakfast for 2 came out to be $50.  Overall, nice ambiance with great bistro food.  What else can you expect from Daniel Bouloud.",1,0,1,Devon L.,"New York, NY",0,45,0

3.0,7/25/2007,"I may be biased here, but I made the mistake of going here during restaurant week. I made a 1pm reservation for lunch but ended up waiting half an hour anyway. Next time, I'll come half an hour early and order food off the regular menu instead. I had the Mahi Mahi which was way overcooked and dry, but the Greek salad and the raspberry chocolate mousse were alright. I hear great things about the burger, but I'm not really a fan of foie gras. While my fish was overcooked this time, I really hope it's a one-time kind of thing and that next time, it'll be better.",0,0,0,J L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,32,2
4.0,6/22/2007,"A burger with foie gras and black truffle. Mouth waters. I'll have that, thanks. Yes, with french fries. Mouth continues to water up until that decadent burger is put in front of me and while I am eating it. Makes for a sloppy meal, but a damn good one. A $32 burger would never fly in SF, but while I'm in NY, I can't complain. I literally can't even talk because my mouth won't stop watering.",2,0,1,Defne A.,"San Francisco, CA",63,123,0
4.0,6/18/2007,"everybody tells me to get the $32 burger here because it's basically what DB's known for.  unfortunately, i don't eat beef.  so out of 8 people at lunch, 7 ordered the burger - which everyone salivated over before devouring.  judging from each burger, it appears DB cooks on the rare-side so if you don't like it too bloody, make sure to just ask for well-done.  i ordered the lonely chicken and arugula.  it proved that a non-beef eater isn't without tasty options at DB.  i also ordred the lone dessert (since my companions were ready to burst from their huge burgers) - the pina colada trifle.  it was hands down the coolest looking dessert i've ever seen.",3,4,2,Lucy Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",43,210,1
4.0,6/13/2007,"Yes, folks, the originator of the $32 burger, DB Bistro Moderne serves up a small slab of delicious beef for your buck.  However, when said beef, no matter how small, contains foie gras and truffles, the importance of the size pales in comparison to the potency of the taste.Other factors -- not so great. The fries were a little overdone, and the restaurant was not very well laid out in my opinion.  The bar/waiting area at which we awaited our table (we were on time; they were running late) is in the middle of two dining areas. Translation: Very little area to stand, high foot traffic and not a restful wait at all. Also, the place is very LOUD, which I guess you get in a room full of fast-talkers, but it still would've been nice not to have to shout over my aforementioned 3-inch tall burger.Overall, 3.67 stars because their burger -- let's just call it ""the $32 menu item heard 'round the world"" -- is pretty fan-freaking-tastic. Other things...I could do without.",5,2,7,Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,618,78
3.0,6/13/2007,"My review could have been biased (downwards) because an ooold couple who sat next to us ruined our meal.  So we got sat next to this relatively over-dressed ooold couple.  The guy wore suit and tie.  That's cool, coz DB is a hip chic restaurant and food there is no where close to cheap.  We did not underdress tho. We were both wearing fancy shirts, dark dinim and 'designer' leather shoes : p.  This lady gave me a nasty stare the moment I sat down.  And, before they leave, she raised her voice and 'asked' the server if she could 'ask him a question' about the dress code in this restaurant'.  The server explained to her that this is a hip restuarant and dress code is pretty much smart casual.  The lady pushed it further, raised her voice to the next level, looked at me constantly and said 'there should be a limit to it and you shouldn't be letting everyone in'.Maybe I shouldn't have taken it as personal but I did.  After the couple left, the server came to appoligize to us that he could have said something back to the lady on the spot but did not want to offend the lady.Food wise, well....first off the burger was tasty, as promised!  I guess you just can't go wrong with putting truffles, kobe beef and foie gras!   My friend ordered the salmon which was good.  We ordered this bottle which was very reasonable table red for about $45 and was really tasty.   Service was 4 stars and all servers have a cute french accent. But the ambience was rather lacking for a saturday night as it was not very crowded.I would recommend to sit at the back of the restaurant coz it seemed to be more packed there.  We got seated at the front which was rather quiet for a saturday night in NYC.Service:  4 StarsFood: 3.5 StarsDecor/Ambience: 3.5 Stars but I expect more people  for a NYC saturday night",1,1,1,Edmond T.,"San Jose, CA",39,235,301
4.0,6/13/2007,"Come on, you knew I wouldn't let my 400th review be of something in SF!  Instead I dedicate review number 400 to the $32 burger.  As Kate H points out, it's the place that started the expensive burger craze.  Leave it to Daniel Boulud to start to such a thing.  And it's a damn good burger.  But seriously, I could stuff a lot of things with truffles and foie gras and call them delicious, but I suppose he gets credit for the idea.The decor is chic and fun, but seemed kind of wasted on the midtown east power-lunchers with their clients or the bored, rich wives on vacation who're just lunching at the hotel before their private shopping appointment at Bendel's.  I, too, was there on a business lunch, but still, a little stuffy for my tastes.  Go for the burger and the cheapest Daniel B. menu in NYC (for foodies on a budget) but I probably won't be back soon unless someone else is picking up the tab.",13,9,16,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636
5.0,6/12/2007,"So I know everyone is raving about the burger but I just couldn't do it to myself, that wk was BEA wk which meant a dinner every night so I had to take it easy but any other time I would def try it. The place was not big at all and I did not realize that it was attached to a hotel but that didn't take away from the atmosphere. So of course I started w/ the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare (celery Coulis, Fennel, Mango, Curry Dressing) - amazing, I was a little apprehensive w/ the curry but it worked and I practically licked my plate. My friend ordered the Maine Lobster Salad (Mesclun, Hearts of Palm, Artichokes, Pesto Dressing) - delicious, just the right amount of lobster but I'm greedy and could've ate more. For entre I decided on the Ramps Ravioloe (Morels, Asparagus, Fava Beans, Brown Butter) - my mouth is watering thinking about it, just great, not too heavy. I also ordered the Pommes Dauphines on the side which were tasty, yes I know, I already had enough carbs, why order more. So aside from the yummy food, the staff was very friendly as well. the sommelier really knew what he was talking about and my friend who is an aficionado of wine himself ended up chatting up for a good 20 mins at the end of the meal. It was nice when you come across a sommelier who is passionate about what he does and doesn't turn his nose up to you when he's talking about it.

5.0,5/6/2007,"I absolutely loved the food.  That alone gives it five stars.  (Also, I wasn't paying, so price wasn't an issue this time).  I got the artichoke soup, the lemon sole, and the rhubarb dessert.  The combinations of flavors were well-executed.  There was a mixture of  texture and flavor that kept everything interesting, and it was all delicious.The artichoke soup was SO good I will dream about it for days.  Rich and creamy I could not imagine it being any better.The lemon sole was great - on a bed of asparagus with a meyer lemon sauce and a side of basmati rice.  The fish was cooked perfectly and there was just enough sauce.  The rhubarb dessert was shared by our table and nearly led to fighting and licking of the plate.  Even after we were all ""so full we couldn't eat another bite"" we ate the dessert.  It was crunchy and light and soft and creamy and sugary and tart and warm and cold all at once!  I absolutely loved it.",2,0,3,Molly R.,"Daly City, CA",14,41,0

4.0,1/24/2007,"This place is cool, the burger lives up to its hype as the best in the city. It's juice runneth over - literally - but that's cool, you can sop little dabs with the Parmesan bun. The foie gras, short ribs & black truffles are quite neatly stuffed inside, to delectable effect. It still tastes like a burger, with that certain i-do-know-what (yeah, dug, foie gras & short ribs) within. They also serve some of the tastiest fries I've had, the service is prompt, attentive & courteous, and the room is neat. We also sampled a delicious homemade duck pate and a lobster and crabmeat bake as apps, and they were great too, particularly the pate. Toss in a couple cocktails, beers & tip, and we were around $75 per person, so it's sightly more expensive than McD's for a burger, but it's one of those must try NYC food items that I'm glad I had.

The waiters are well-informed on the cuisine and wine and are very helpful with suggestions. The space is a little small but tastefully decorated.

My boyfriend had Foie Gras w/ Apricots to start and Crispy Duck Confit w/ Wild Mushrooms for the entree. I had Orecchiette Pasta w/ Lamb Ragout to start and Veal Scallopine at the waiter's suggestion for the entree. Neither of us had any complaints. The dishes were well-prepared and very tasty.Overall: 4/5 Excellent food and service to match. The restaurant can feel a little cramped when it's full, but you could also call that ""intimate.""

3.0,8/10/2006,"The restaurant that began the insane-o overpriced burger craze also serves good fish.Good, not great. There's a reason that everyone around you is tucking into the burger. It's not just the spectacle of dissecting its contents (short ribs, foie gras, etc.) and dismantling it for consumption (it's tall!) - it's that you're spending more than ten bucks for it. I had a decent dish of skate wing in brown butter sauce. And I should have had the burger.Note: not a great place to take generous parents in from out of town...if they're anything like mine, they'll want a place is less noisy than the LIRR waiting area on a summer weekend.

I liked the shallot vinagrette Bibb salad, and the bite I had of the tuna tartare was good. They served pretzel bread, and mini deep fried pieces of bread with tapanade. Husb and I both got the DB burgers and he (a beef lover) thought it was amazing. I thought it was good but since I'm not a huge beef person my favorite part was the parmesan bun.
