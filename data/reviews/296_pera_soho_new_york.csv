5.0,4/20/2019,"Ambiance, service and food is superb! We've been to many Turkish-Meditteranean restaurants before and Pera Soho was by far the best among them.The service and hospitality was unusual for New York because even in the fine dining restaurants the waiters are not very kind and I am not very happy with the service of the restaurants most of the time.I asked our waiter's name on purpose just to mention here. JOSE was really really good, he deserves every penny of what he gets. He is smiling and helping and give food advises from heart. He did not throw the check when we are done (as most of the restaurants!!). Thank you Jose, hope this place never loses him About the food, we had hummus, labneh, shaslik and Adana(lamb cut roll) ; everything was great! The Greek Salad's dressing was delicious.. and for the dessert we had chocolate lava cake with pistachio ice cream, very light and great gooey cake.Anyway, we took our notes and definitely coming back! Probably for breakfast first",4,0,3,Jas M.,"Edgewater, NJ",3,32,35
2.0,4/16/2019,"My friends and I met here for some food and drinks on a Saturday afternoon. We met around 3:30PM and sat at the bar while we waited for a table outside to be ready. When we arrived, we gave our name and was told it would be an hour for a table to be ready. The hostess wrote our name down, basically on some loose paper she found at her stand. We were dubious that she was going to try and find us a seat. It was clear they were hoping we would get drinks at the bar, give up and leave. After an hour at the bar, one of my friends went to check in to see what our status was. The hostess had no idea who she was and said our name wasn't down. Of course. My friend asked to speak to the manager and he got us a table right away.We were seated outside and there were probably 7 open tables we could have been seated at earlier I'm sure. We then had to wait 30 minutes to be served. We had no idea what was going on. We tried to get people's attention and the just walked right by us. It was incredibly rude and it became clear we were being 'punished' for requesting the table we were promised. How dare we! in fact, we were not served, one of my friends went up to the bar and got us drinks. At happy hour price. So really a win for us. A server noticed this and came over and asked if we needed help with anything. We told him that we had been waiting for 30 minutes and had not been served so we took matters into our own hands. At 5PM, the kitchen opened again and my friends aggressively got a server to come over so they could order food. At this point, the manager came over and apologized for the wait and told us we could get a round of drinks for free. This was nice and we appreciated the gesture a lot. Our moods shifted instantly and we were enjoying ourselves again. The food came,everyone was happy, our free drinks came. We were really enjoying our sunny afternoon outside. The string lights were starting to come on and we were having great conversation. It shaped up into a really lovely evening. From the time our food was served to the time we just gave up and got the check, an hour passed with no service. We all wanted more drinks and more food but no one came to our table. We could not figure it out. It was really insane. Some of the worst service I have ever experienced. The drinks here are good, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is really nice-especially outside. The location is amazing. The service is worse than abysmal. I wouldn't recommend coming here to anyone.",4,1,1,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,1361,1267
1.0,4/11/2019,"If you're a fan of long intimate experiences this place is for you. Had a group of five people, we were sat smack in the middle of the dinning room. Fantastic seating. Thought, you know right in the mix, have our water refilled, drinks brought out, whoops not the case. Firstly, 2 out of 5 glasses were dirty. I'm not talking a little hard water stain here and there. I'm talking things in the glasses. Not bad still over 50% some would even call that good. We then waited another 35 minutes for a beer and soda. You'd think not bad, for 5 people that takes a while. Well only 2 people ordered drinks, so I appreciate the intimacy in waiting. When I go to a place to eat I don't want to be bothered. I don't want my drinks and appetizers and mains to flow out like a broken water hose leisurely. I want them crammed down my throat all at once the colder, the better. I realize the bartender has to prep the ingredients for those 2 concoctions, so no sweat. After seeing numerous other tables, of similar party size, get their food before us, I was thought nice, they know I hate being rushed. It takes a special art to actively navigate around the table nearest the bar and kitchen and that dedication is commendable. Finally after all the food was brought out at once, because appetizers are dead it's 2019, might as well just put all the food on one plate, let's save that water; half were cold. It's a shame because they weren't supposed to be, and I wanted to love it. It was actually really good. Finally when we went to pay, all was good. I signed my check, left the tip, all while letting the server know the issues at hand and how I appreciated the nuances of the slow but all at ounce approach being revolutionized here. Now, I thought that'd be the end. I thought I scrapped by and put that experience to bed, but then I get my credit card bill. And wouldn't you know it, those shysters added more on to the tip for themselves. I'm no stickler either I tip perfectly standard 20% every time. I thought maybe it was just me, try to pull a fast one on the most unassuming of people. Wrong, those geniuses did it to every member in the party that paid. An even more modern, modern day Ocean's 11 racket. I love it. Pera soho, is great if you have several hours to kill to wait for a drink and food. I appreciate that restraint in servers and hosts not bothering us with annoying water refills, or food being brought out timely. Wait and bring it out at ounce, one trip to the table is much more efficient. If efficiency is your game then come here. They're so efficient they just plop dirty cups, clean 'em. We're talking water here, nice try. Can easily get a few more uses out of them. Environmentally conscious, another plus. Pera soho, come for the ambience, stay because you're food is still sitting at the kitchen pass.",0,0,0,Stan M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,4/8/2019,"This place has a great ambience and its in the heart of the city. We chose this place for a sunny Saturday morning brunch. We had to make a reservation since we were a group of 9 people and it was pretty crowded that day. The brunch menu was extensive and there were a lot of options for the non vegetarians but hardly any options for the vegetarians. I ordered the Lamb Adana cut roll, the dish looked extremely captivating but the taste was not as per my expectations. The drinks were unlimited and we ordered Mimosas and Sangrias for us but honestly I have had better Mimosas.

Staff was attentive and friendly. Good ambiance, decent drinks- Ihad a cucumber cooler and even though it was 7 pm sharp they offered me happy hour price which was sweet and flexible. I would not pay that much for a chicken in this style in the Bay Area, but I don't know culinary styles or prices in NYC. I wasn't disappointed. I think solid 4 is pretty fair.

4.0,3/9/2019,"Came in for dinner on a Friday night and was slightly concerned by how empty the place was. I soon learned that we were just early. We got seated right away and halfway through our meal, all the other tables in the place were full.We ordered family style. Here's what you must try and what you should avoid. Salmon: Must try. Cooked to perfection with a crisp on one side, the salmon was a well done menu item. If you're not a big fan of cauliflower, avoid the bed it is planted on. Brussel Sprout Salad: Soooo good. Brussel sprouts are shredded and paired wit cheese and sauce and pears. Perfect for sharing and I loved every bite.Lamb Slides: I typically do not like lamb, but this had me wishing we ordered way more of these. The sliders come with two, we asked if they could add one for our party of 3 and they said no... (typically a place will add a piece and charge you for it, it seemed a little ridiculous to say no). But the meat was high quality and well seasoned, extremely tasty. Chicken ""Adana"" Cut Roll: Not tasty. This comes with ground chicken that does not taste like chicken, it was almost mystery meat and felt inedible. I took the meat out and just ate the plain lavash bread, which is nothing special.",11,0,10,Tara N.,"San Diego, CA",68,209,1090
4.0,3/6/2019,"This basket of fries appeared between myself and my vegan company like a miracle. I was at Pera for a professional event and this basket provided ample balm to the conversation and saved us with dietary requirements from getting too sloshed on the drink alone. This photo is quite dark because of the mood lighting, but believe me when I tell you the fries were golden, cripsy, had potato skin fried to a crunch on the outside, and very generously seasoned with parsley.

3.0,1/30/2019,Lovely warm atmosphere and the service was wonderful. Waiters weren't pushy or annoying. The food was not exceptional but at the same time not bad either. 3 stars because I've had the same Turkish dishes from other Turkish restaurants and the portion size was smaller while the price is higher at Pera Soho.  I guess you're paying for the atmosphere. Plus the seating was cramped and I felt awkward talking to my friend. People are so close they can hear you whisper and if it's busy then you have to really speak loudly.,0,0,0,R C.,"Edgewater, NJ",32,66,151

2.0,1/26/2019,"Again another place that doesn't live upto the hype around it. It wasn't all bad but could have been much better.We went there for Saturday brunch with high expectations. The menu looked promising and we were excited to try it. We started with mimosa (no complaints there) and ordered a few chips with classic hummus and paprika hummus. Normally would expect a mediterranean place to have some flavor but to our disappointment, the paprika was flavorless.. well fine that's forgivable as it was just an appetizer..Next we ordered our mains; My shakshuka can be described in three words; plain, sweet and under cooked. ITwo of my friends ordered 'menemen eggs' and were sorely disappointed.. it was under cooked eggs in sweet tomato sauce.. they had to add paprika to make it tolerable for their taste buds.Only happy person on the table was another friend who ordered steaks (Thank god they didn't go wrong with that)We left our brunch a tad bit disappointed and somewhat annoyed. Went to nearby Thelewala to get some nizami rolls to make up for the disappointing brunch.

If you need a spot for a big group brunch this a good place to try. The food is moderately priced and pretty decent -- nothing to write home about but good.

Yet, the restaurant and bar were clearly open and they were letting people in as we walked by. Drinks are drinks, but clearly the small group of 7 I was with wasn't a priority. Absurdly slow drinks and then a mini table where we sat with a localized AC ceiling unit blasting in our faces that they couldn't turn off for a good 10 minutes.I'll come back for another try and the food since the location and venue seems spectacular, but a strike 1 here so far.",1,0,0,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",860,486,143

But there was only 1 waiter that was working and the rest bus boys/food runners. He was nice and he tried but how much can 1 person do.The food was just Salty!!! We had the hummus - which tasted ok.

There was no talking after, clearly nobody in the restaurant understands customer service, so we ended up leaving and going to Aurora right around the corner, which is not even comparable.

I sipped on the Soho Blossom all evening which is now one of my favorite drinks ever. It wasn't crowded surprisingly and I'm wondering why people aren't up on this spot.At 7pm we decided to have dinner and we were seated in their outdoor courtyard. This is where they truly win...AMBIANCE! The have lights all over and it really made me feel like I wasn't in the middle of NYC.Food! No complaints here  from me and my girls as we truly enjoyed our meals. I got the Macedonian Chicken which was delicious and my friends got the sirloin and short ribs.The service was just as good as we had an attentive waiter. I definitely would come back here!

4.0,8/26/2018,"When a restaurant delivers on so many levels, it's like hitting a home run.Located in Soho, one of my favorite Manhattan 'hoods, my friend suggested Pera Soho for brunch. I could not be more pleased.Gorgeous patio/outdoor seating? (accommodating any number of patrons including large parties)---CheckAttentive service? CheckWater glasses always refilled promptlyDelicious food? CheckSince it was my first visit, I was indecisive what to select since I was steering away from carbs (and alcohol) on this given day.They will also accommodate requests to meet any dietary restrictions.My friend chose a beef burger with fries and really enjoyed her selection. I was intrigued with the shakshuka eggs which was poached eggs in tomato sauce, soujouk, kasseri cheese, scallions, lavash chips. I learned that soujouk was a type of beef meatball but since I don't eat beef, I asked for it to be eliminated.Their food is Mediterranean in style and i would love to return for dinner some time. The indoor space was just as gorgeous as the outdoor.There was also a brunch pre-fixe option which included a cocktail and a main for $25. Pretty good deal.My opinion of the main I chose was one of satisfaction. I enjoyed the combination of scallions and the chips integrated in the tomato sauce complementing the poached eggs. My only observation was that it was a bit loose or saucy and I'm sure it was due to the absence of the meatballs. Despite this, I really enjoyed my brunch meal accompanied by a delicious iced coffee. Prices are about moderate-high (most likely dinner entrees) but also indicative of the neighborhood and gorgeous ambiance.It certainly seemed to be quite the crowd pleaser today.

I came ten minutes late.My friends were seated and ordered some appetizers and drinks. At NO time were they told the kitchen and brunch would stop being served at 4 pm. The waitress came several times to get our order but we weren't ready and again at NO time were we told the kitchen closes at 4 pm or the prix fixe won't be available at 4 pmWhen we start to order at 4 pm the prix fixe brunch the waitress first states the whole table has to do the prix fixe(also not written anywhere on menu) brunch. Then she goes back to verify and states the prix fixe brunch is not available at all and we need to hurry to place the order because the kitchen is closing. I ask to speak to the supervisor who just parrots what the waitress says . I ask him if that's the case why did they accept the brunch reservation for 3:30, why aren't the prix fixe brunch hours posted outside or in the menu, and why the waitress didn't inform us immediately the kitchen would be closing . All he could was repeat the kitchen is closing. He wasn't apologetic for any of this fiasco and kept acting like he was doing us a special favor .We ordered and ate their mediocre food. Their bartender is their saving grace.Our waitress pretty much disappeared after the discussion with the manager.But this is pretty basic restaurant service 101:1.

2.0,6/25/2018,"Our experience last night was just horrendous.  After we were seated we waited for water and the waitress for slightly too long.  We ordered drinks, which took just a little too long.  No worries, I'm industry and always very patient and understanding-that wouldn't last long.They thought they were out of an item we wanted and we were told they'd let us know if that was the case so we could choose something else.  They told us 20 minutes later when our other items arrived.  We still had menus on the table and the server realized she'd forgotten.  We decided to order two more items since the appetizers weren't enough for a meal.  We finished our starters and again no one checked on us.  The waitress came over after another 20 minutes and asked if we wanted to order anything else.  She'd never placed our remaining order.  We asked for water since our glasses had been empty since our cocktails arrived.  After ten more minutes we were able to flag down the busboy to get water.The owner manager and the manager/host were walking around like they were surveying their land, literally leaning against the wall looking around, never noticing that things were not running smoothly.We ate the two items we'd been waiting on for 40 minutes (20 minutes after placing the order and another 20 minutes when the server realized she hadn't sent the order).  We asked for the check.The bathrooms were a mess and lacking TP-when I brought it to their attention the manager/host was leaning on a counter, chin resting on his hand, bored and staring at a computer-he said he'd pass it along.I went back to our table and after ten minutes no one had come back over to run our card.  By then our patience was more than depleted.  I took my card and went to the same guy, still leaning and still looking bored, and asked to pay.  I told him how disappointed we were in the service.I signed for the bill total and marked cash for the tip.  The waitress brought it up to me and asked if I was paying cash.  No, the receipt was a completed credit card charge, so obviously not.  I assume she was asking for the cash tip.  I did tip her, although nowhere near my standard minimum, and I really shouldn't have.I ended up tipping way more than usual because I literally found and tipped the other employees separately because I didn't want to punish them for poor management or their server's inadequacies.  Rather than order more drinks or dessert, like we'd planned, we left.  There were no customers inside, maybe ten tables outside so it's not like they were slammed or understaffed.  While we were there another table walked out because they'd waited for ten minutes without getting water or a greeting.  The food was outstanding so we're bummed we won't go back.",0,0,0,Erin G.,"New York, NY",16,14,4

I tried the apricot margarita to start which was way too sugary. Decided to switch over to the blood orange martini they had on happy hour and those were delicious.

We were led to seats that were just under the umbrella, however, once the waitress separated the table, it was out of the umbrella's coverage, and therefore we would get drizzled/rained on. So we moved one table over, just making it under the umbrella. My friend and I were still able to feel bits of rain, but I was just glad it wasn't pouring rain on us. None of the workers bothered to move the umbrella a tiny bit over, even though nobody was sitting on the other end of the umbrella.The waitress came over to ask us if we'd like to start off with any drinks first, but my friend and I weren't ready, so she gave us more than enough time before coming back. My friend ordered an eggs benedict with salmon while I got a ""shakshuka"" eggs, with orange juice (pineapple juice was sold out) and Mediterranean fries.The food took approximately 40 minutes to come out, much longer than I thought. Even the customers who came after my friend and I had ordered already and were seated adjacent to us received their appetizers/sides before we even got our fries or meal. I also finished more than half of my orange juice and half of my water before the meal finally arrived. The order in which the food came was a bit weird for me because a majority of restaurants would serve the fries first, but my friend and I got our meals first then the fries. At this point though, I'm just glad something came because the wait was just ridiculous.The food overall was decent.The waitress did check up on us once, but no water refills were made.I won't be returning, at least not on my own will.",0,0,0,Liana Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,11,16

I will say the waiters were attentive with filling our glasses with water (or drinks), but the place wasn't too busy at the time.

I ordered the steak and eggs as a meal. The steak itself was unfortunately a bit dry and overcooked.

When the drinks finally arrived, the ""dirty"" Martinis were without olives or olive juice. Multiple people tried the ""martinis"" and pulled faces. The drinks were sub par by any standard. In addition, service was very weak throughout our 90ish minute stay and only saved by a guileless hostess who was somehow forced to cover tables. Not a good sign! All of this was especially disappointing as we've visited in the past and service and drinks were not a problem.

(which i didn't want, because it was really nice outside.) but i said sure. inside, my friend and i hardly received service. after a few hours- when things had already died down- we were trying for an hour to get our server to come over. he served the table directly in front of us multiple times but would ignore us on the way to the back. finally i waved him down and politely let him know that it had been over an hour, and if possible, maybe he could include a complimentary drink to make up for it. he was nice about it and said ""let me ask the bartender."" the manager (or someone in charge) came out and he was clearly pissed! he said that reservations don't exist at Pera Soho and service is on a first come, first serve basis... funny because we had been there for 3+ hours at that point. i asked him why yelp allowed us to make a reservation and he said they needed to change that because it's irrelevant. okay...? he begrudgingly served us 2 free glasses of wine. i try to be forgiving of servers when they have busy days, but overall, this experience was really bad.

How could such an oasis exist without us knowing about it? We advised the hostess that we had a $50 Open Table reward to which she responded with a knowledgeable ""no problem.""  Then reality set it in- we tried to order food and drinks! That was an ordeal that last 20 minutes without even water or silverware, culminating with one of us physically going to find a waiter. Drinks, another 15 minutes... appetizer came after the entree, even though we asked to cancel it. Water was requested numerous time. Never saw the waiter again.When we finally got the check the waiter said no one knew how to use the Open Table card. He would need to call the manager at home. Ugh! More waiting. The bill was still pretty high, but I paid in cash to finally be released from this purported oasis. I must admit, I did something I have never done before, I left a tiny tip. I felt we paid for something we canceled (octopus appetizer) and did not received adequate service. Please don't berate me for this-I've waited on tables before, too. What happened next is the piece de resistance! When we were outside the confines of Pera, we were taking some photos and the waited tapped me on the shoulder and said we didn't leave enough money.

Great drinks - the cucumber cooler cocktail is my favorite, followed by the blood orange martini. Some of the appetizers were hits and some were misses. I also ordered the lamb entree, which was better than I expected. Service was friendly. Note that the happy hour menu only applies if you're at the bar or high top tables up top.

The real problem was with the service. We had actually booked a reservation for dinner and learned of the happy hour menu when we were seated. But they refused to serve us the happy hour items at our table, insisting that we order and consume them inside at the bar, even when the bar area was packed and outside was empty.

2.0,8/26/2017,"Not pleased. Great atmosphere, but disappointed in everything else. The staff was kind and well-meaning, but this restaurant was not generally hospitable. We came for a light brunch. I ordered the sliders and requested the Mediterranean fries instead of the parsnip chips. They said that was not possible, but I could just order an additional side of fries. I declined. I could understand an upcharge for the fries with the sliders but making me just order an additional side? After they took forever to deliver our orders, I learned why. These ""chips"" are essentially garnish. Frizzled shredded parsnips served underneath/between the two sliders. The sliders were pretty good in flavor, nothing outstanding. My dining companion said her chicken was pretty overlooked. THEN, when we ask for separate checks she asks whose bill to put the water on. They offered us still or sparkling, pretty standard thing in NYC. A lot of restaurants just have their own carbonated tap water. Apparently the sparkling water was $8. It was a refillable bottle, not a San pellegrino or branded in any way, so why would one suspect it isn't just tap water unless the wait staff said something? Just not impressed.

2.0,6/27/2017,"Short review: Modern Turkish/Mediterranean with some standouts though overall a lot of quite bad dishes. Lackluster service outside of a very good busboy who refilled the water and grabbed the waiters attention. Kudos to him.The restaurant consisted of a very crowded bar and a spacious albeit sparse inside. Our group was in the back of the inside area near an interesting Turkish transit mural. I liked the inside though it was a bit dark. If I wanted to take a page from my other reviews, too much mood lighting. Originally our group of 4 arrived with the two others lagging behind and the woman in front confirmed that there would be more.Our server brought over some menus and a single drink menu for our group. It was a little odd due to the number of people here. He eventually brought over a second one and asked rather early whether anyone wanted a drink and if people wanted an appetizer before they arrived. As the other two were not here yet, we declined.The other two arrived and eventually the guy came over and we ordered drinks. I got a westaphaner weissbier on tap which as usual was excellent. I tried a cucumber cocktail with some spices down the side from someone which was good. The other people enjoyed their drinks.Eventually the waiter came by and we ordered our dishes.Mezes/appetizers: From strongest to weakest as they were for the table.Chicken ""Adana"" Kebab: Hand-ground daily, marinated with eastern Mediterranean spices, wrapped inside lavash with parsley, tomato and onion (11)This was easily the best appetizer. Little pieces of very well flavored rolled chicken kebabs. There were 5/6 of them. I'd definitely order this again. 4.5Pastirma-wrapped Feta-stuffed dates: Filled with creamy Bulgarian sheep's milk feta and char-grilled on an open flame (10)I personally got this and it was a hit. It was devils on horseback though with pastirma instead of bacon. Excellent rendition. I think there were 4 dates on each of the skewers but I could be mistaken. 4.0Fig & Goat Cheese Flatbread: Thin-crust lavash flatbread, baked pomegranate arils, pomegranate molasses (14)It needed a bit more pomegranate flavor but the cheese/texture was good. 4 large pieces. 3.5Warm hummus with cured beef ""pastirma"" (9)Hummus had an interesting brown-ish color but otherwise it tasted fine. We got the meat on the side as requested which came with a very small portion (3 bite sized pieces) but it tasted fine. 2.5Lahana Salata: Shaved Brussels sprout, scallions, dill, cucumbers, lemon dressing with feta (12+3 for cheese)The lemon dressing and cheese were both basically missing so it was a plate of finely chopped raw Brussels sprouts. Frankly terrible. One of the worst appetizers I have had in recent memory. I wish at least they would roast the sprouts. 0.5Total: 9.5/20. 2.37.5I had to flag down the guy at some point to order our mains. He was nowhere to be seen though there was a crowd outside.Mains: I'd add a description but there isn't enough room.Papparadelle ""Mousakka"" 19 sans meat, 25/28 with.I got this with short rib and another got it with meatballs which were OK. Plate was massive. I was expecting something that looked like a moussaka but it rather looked like a pasta dish with a very brown sauce. I should have looked it up before ordering as I wouldn't have gotten it otherwise. The papparadelle was well OK though some pieces stuck together. The sauce was incredibly rich and overwhelmed the eggplant and mushrooms. The short rib in there added to the richness but was cooked quite well.2.5 (mine,) 2.0 (his)Seared Greek salmon: 27Someone got this and the first time it was essentially raw inside. I eventually got the waiter again and the dish was brought out again when most of us were almost finished. If the waiter was not a ghost, we probably wouldn't have had a bit of an awkward time waiting. No rating as I didn't try.Grape leaf stuffed branzino: (31)I tried a little bit of the branzino which was excellent. Very flaky and light. The gigantes were excellent and was easily the highlight of dinner. 4.0Stuffed Eggplant ""Dolma"": 19Two people had this. It oddly didn't have a grape leaf outside (is it really a dolma then?) I tried a little bit and the flavor was fine. It was two pretty large pieces. 3.011.5/20: 2.8/5Desserts:We got the dessert menu after finding the waiter again. He brought over two and eventually a third. I won't go into full descriptions but I personally got a pistachio creme brulee which came with an unneeded caramel sauce below and a cold/hard chocolate/pistacho bar (fuilette or something similar on top. I'd give it a 3.0 as it needed larger pieces of pistachio to add some crunch. There was also a pear dessert which was fine though I didn't have much and a chocolate cake which was quite tasty.24/45I'd personally give the service a 1/5.

2.0,6/13/2017,"This restaurant managed to make the worst hummus I've ever tasted.   The color alone should have been a warning. It looked like it's been sitting there for days and tasted like it.  The muhammara also did not look nor taste fresh.  I had the Mante, which came covered with dried up cooked yogurt.  It tasted ok but the yogurt was too dry and tangy.   At one point we asked for a side order of yogurt and that took 15 minutes to arrive and our waiter had disappeared and the bus boys were at a loss when we tried to get their help.   The fried calamari and octopus were good.  The zucchini balls were also well made, and so were the turkey meatballs.We used to come to this restaurant over the past few years and we loved the lamb kebabs.  But these were taken off the menu now.  The ambiance has now become more of a lounge atmosphere, with a nice outdoor patio space.  I would not come here if expecting a halfway decent Turkish culinary experience.",0,0,0,Rania B.,"Naples, FL",22,14,1

Dinner itself was good - I had the stuffed eggplant, and I loved the strong blend of spices, and this delicious, salty topping they put on top of it - I wish there was more!  It was delicious, but I think overpriced - the ""stuffed"" eggplant, was really just eggplant skin rolled around rice.  While it was good, I would have much rather just had dinner at the happy hour special - I would have been able to get a more food, more variety, and a drink for the same price.",2,0,1,Andrea X.,"Manhattan, NY",30,157,0

1.0,5/28/2017,"I have never experienced such horrible hospitality. This was by far, the worst experience I've had at a restaurant/bar in my life.My friend and I walked in this past Friday at 1:57pm(thanks to social media check ins!) the courtyard was empty with only 4 tables out of about 30-40 taken. When we walked in we were told that the hostess would seat us. We told the hostess we wanted to have a drink and she said it was self serve and that we could only have our drinks in the enclosed perimeter of the courtyard. After asking if we could sit at a table for our drinks,  she had some hesitation but said we could and that someone would be over. After waiting for some time, our server arrived. When asking about a drink and if it was sweet, he responded that it was apricot and nothing else. It was gruff but figured he didn't mean to be rude. I tried to ask if the drink was sweet and he remained difficult. I then asked for my drink. After finding out we were not ordering food he got quite sour and walked away. It's Memorial Day weekend and we wanted to have a drink and go. We weren't nearing happy hour service and the place was empty. We still shrugged off the exchange.While waiting for our drinks and having asked for water, we saw another waiter/busser filling water glasses for a table right next to ours. He had two pitchers in his hands, serving water to the two top. As he was walking away we asked if we could have some water and he continued to walk away, clearly having heard us - as he was right next to us. On his way back, we asked if we could have some water and he said our server would get us. He asked if we were getting food, and said we were getting drinks and he said we had to go back to the bar. After telling him we had already ordered drinks, he still refused to give us water. While this happened, I could see our server berating the hostess, gesturing, what seemed to be about us having drinks only.At this point we were appalled, it was by far the most horrid experience, because it wasn't just about bad service, it was absolutely, without question, RUDE. No misinterpretation, just total irreverence and a F. YOU. We then decided to leave and as we were walking out, the server came up to us to say we ordered drinks. We responded and said that the busser refused to serve us water and that it was ridiculous.I can't believe the way these people acted.Both my friend and I have close ties to the F&B industry and I have no problem letting everyone and anyone know about this horrid experience at Pera Soho.The servers and management should be ashamed of themselves.There were empty tables everywhere, if people walk in and are willing to pay the $40-$45 to have two cocktails/tax/tip and go.

While sitting there, I overheard people telling the manager that they had been waiting for 20 minutes to order food only to be told that the kitchen was closed by the time someone went to take an order.  I finally placed my order, but the bartender was immediately distracted by the manager, who had come over to do damage control with the 20 minute table. I knew that my order probably got lost in the shuffle and asked if she could confirm that it had been put in the system. Sure enough it hadn't. She corrected things, but by that point, it had become a bad experience.  Not sure how a place that can afford to occupy this space can be run so poorly.

We were promptly seated but it took several minutes for anyone to come by and get water or drink orders. There was a handful of tables but they were not busy. For appetizers  we ordered the salad and calamari. Salad was nothing special and the calamari was very chewy. We also had the trio of spreads which were ok. Entrees we had the salmon and steak frites. The steak was only offered to be medium well or well done. And the food was just not good. Very forgettable and not well seasoned. Dessert was alright.

As we walked in, we were immediately greeted and seated in the outside patio. I loved their wooden tables and gigantic umbrellas. I got quite sunny around noon, but the umbrellas helped block the strong rays of sunshine while allowing some heat to seep through.For appetizers, we chose the watermelon and feta cubes! Ah, I love the combination of sweet and savory, and this dish definitely give me this feeling. Also, the fresh, juicy watermelon mixed with the creamy, fragrant feta created a very unique experience. I would come here just for this dish. Moving on to my entree, I got the lamb wrap with fries, and I was sadly disappointed. Usually, lambs are generously seasoned with a variety of flavors and spices, but somehow, the wrap lacked flavors. Even the fries. The fries were sprinkled with some seasonings, but they weren't very fresh, crispy, or hot. Be careful with what you order! Some dishes are delicious, but the quality is not consistent.

3.0,11/23/2016,"Right in the heart of Soho this place has so much potential but sadly can't execute the most important part...the food. Let me start by saying the decor is beautiful and I want to like this place so badly! I came for lunch and ordered the grilled octopus, calamari, and watermelon feta salad. The bread was clearly microwaved bc it was warm for a few minutes and instantly turned rock hard. Sometimes restaurants don't care about the bread, fine. Out comes the food and the presentation is lovely! I was so excited to dig in and after a few bites of the octopus was so disappointed. Half of it was warm and other bites were cold. The calamari was questionable. The batter fell off every piece once my fork touched it and the calamari itself was SO chewy and I've never experienced this before but...stringy. My friend and I were both so turned off and couldn't eat it. The watermelon feta salad was good bc well, that's HARD to mess up. After all, you're simply chopping up watermelon and cheese. Maybe they had a bad day and I'm willing to try this place again. Definitely a great place for drinks but based on my experience, I wouldn't come here for a dining experience.

Main courses for lunch: the minty/beef dumplings in a unique lemony/cheesy white cream sauce. Quality meal and huge portion, but not my thing.

1.0,9/5/2016,"Plain disgusting...all the way from the food, the service, to the outrageous prices and anything in between! My wife's company arranged for a private get together there for about 20 people.  We pre-arranged the menu offerings including the wines.  Once in the joint, we realized that everything was in disarray. Terrible, sub-par Turkish food which otherwise is one of the most outstanding cuisines in the world. It was more of a mediocre fast food quality rather than a decent restaurant fare. Nothing, not a single dish was worthy of mentioning here. The individuals attending this party were from various cultures, nationalities, and backgrounds and due to the nature of their business they were seasoned world travelers as having been working in a multinational enterprise.  And ALL of them have been in Turkey on business purposes and love the Turkish food.  Alas, this place made them wonder whether this was really Turkish food which they came to experience before as it was totally perverted in taste, quality and overall deliverance. Not one dish was properly done.  The service was so below par that we had to virtually beg the guy to stop and question why on earth he could not even bring the drinks properly.  We wanted to have a second serving of ""mitite kofte"" (which probably was the ONLY dish barely edible) but he outright ignored us.  The wines were awful.  Reds were 'hot', the whites were 'warm'... and we just could not find an individual to respond to us as to why were they serving us these wines in such pitiful manner.  No one was in charge!  Now the total cost of this awful mockery...twice what they came to an agreement with us previously! Yes, twice as much!  They ripped us off twice over the prearranged amount which was a legit contract by the way!  There was no point in arguing as they had our credit card info hence we had to just sign it up and walk away as there were some clients in the fold. We just didn't want to spoil their already spoiled evening.  A final note; no one drank anything that night as the wines were a joke but just a couple of beers.  Rest drank bottled water.  Although we planned the event to last 4 hrs or so, we were out in 2hrs... And that says it all!  The owners must be ashamed of themselves for such a despicable arrangement. You sir/madam; lost a true multinational who employs several thousand people only in NY and we let them know of the rip off in your establishment.  Respectfully.",0,0,0,Omer F K.,"Bannockburn, IL",0,13,0

3.0,8/20/2016,"Pera, where to begin? I used to come here fairly often because it was a pretty easy happy hour spot from my old job and would still pop in pretty frequently since I'm still so close to my former co-workers. Basically if you remember the number 7 you're pretty set here for happy hour. All the deals here are seven dollars. The bar bites, the HH cocktails, wine and beer area all 7. When happy hour starts it's usually pretty quiet and easy to get a spot either inside or outside, as the evening wears on though it gets increasingly crowded and you'll see that your seats get poached and it becomes more difficult to navigate, go to the bar and camp out there. Service also get that way, when it's wide open the staff is obviously very quick to get your order and be accommodating but the more the evening drags on they can get pretty snooty.Not a big wine fan so I don't know what they're like. The happy hour cocktails are definitely on the sweeter side if you're into that. They have 4 taps and it rotates, but there's no beer list printed out and you're generally at the mercy of the bartenders to tell you what they are; if they're busy all they'll give you is the name of the brewery which can make deciding really difficult. Cut the guys some slack and put your beers on the damn menu already! Or print out a separate list!The bar bites are okay. You get two choices, but the sliders are basically one item since they come two per order, the rest are pretty small and not quite as filling as you'd hoped.

After being seated I waited just over ten mins for anyone to tend to my table water, I would of liked a cocktail or two maybe a menu. Nada, totally ignored and it wasn't busy. Finally I was given a menu and I had been somewhat interested in restaurant week to get a good taste of several courses it was kind of attitude like ohhh that menu.... Ok at this point I was starving service was not good so you know what don't worry about that I'll just have the octopus because I don't want to waste anymore time or money. Octopus was ok a bit over cooked and a tad salty but edible. When I was done I had to go to the hostess stand ask for my check so I could leave obviously I must of been a troll on the patio they didn't need there.

First of all we showed up for our 8pm reservation at 8pm on the dot only to find our an outdoor table (which was promised to us online twice) would not be ready for 45 min. There were plenty of open tables and when we pointed that out the lackluster hostess suddenly could seat us in 15 min. We grabbed a drink at the bar, which I'd say the best part of our experience at Pera because the bartender actually acknowledged us. 25 minutes later we were seated but once we were seated no one approached us for an order for about 15 minutes. Finally we got up and asked the hostess to send over a server. The hostess appeared to scold an older man who appeared At our table shortly after, disgruntled and unfriendly. Without introducing himself he says ""what do you want"" and we ordered. We were hangry at this point and after our apps not showing up we requested some bread. The waiter acted like it was a major request. Finally our Apps and entrees came and the food runner knocked over my glass of red wine all over me. I mean ALL over my lap. He was very apologetic but the waiter did not give a crap. I actually didn't think they were going to give me a replacement glass of wine but a few minutes later they showed up with it. Unfortunately they charged me for it like nothing had happened. At the end of the day, the food here is OK but the service is TERRIBLE.

We were seated at a nice table for six on the large outside patio, but because the restaurant was so crowded, all of our chairs (and the chairs of everyone at the restaurant) were constantly knocked by the servers rushing to and fro. The chairs have a poor design in that they don't have straight backs but rather curve out, making walkway space even more cramped. Try to sit REALLY close to the table so you don't get hit too much. The food was delicious! I ordered the Shish Kabob Steak which was perfectly flavored with not a drop of fat on any piece of meat, and served with a side of truffle salt fries. I absolutely loved it!

I sat at the bar for awhile before being served, and then when I finally put the order in, it took a long time to get the food. All I ordered was fries, which are quick in a fryer, and a goat cheese dip that I'm sure is easy to make. When I mentioned it to the bartender, he went it grabbed it from the other end of the bar, which makes me think he might have forgotten about it. I only mentioned something because some women who had ordered awhile after me had gotten their food. The fries were also cold by the time I got them. That being said, the outdoor seating is beautiful.The food/drink: As i mentioned, I got the fries, which were really good aside from being a bit cold, and the beet goat cheese dip. I'm not sure what I expected, but you couldn't really taste the goat cheese, which is the reason I had gotten it. The beets gave the dip a pink color which isn't the most appetizing. I ended up eating it because I had bought it. I had also gotten a blood orange drink which wasn't bad. Not phenomenal but certainly tasty. Happy hour put the cost at $7 for 2 appetizers and $7 for the drink.

The weather was perfect to sit outside and it felt like being in a spacious backyard. The waiter was nice and attentive, but that's as far as the positives go.I ordered the roasted brussels sprout with toasted pistachios and melted manchego,  and the fried calamari. I can usually never get enough brussels sprouts wherever I go, but I could not finish my dish here. The dish was too mushy and the cheese was thick and burnt on top. I ended up taking off the layer of cheese and just eating some of the brussels sprouts under.As for the calamari, it wasn't anything to brag about but the dish was more sizable than the other appetizers. We also ordered pastirma wrapped feta stuffed dates. it was a tiny plate with a few pieces costing $10. My friends ordered the steak frites - it must not have been very good because they only ate the steak and the rest of the plate was left untouched.

The fact that it was practically empty should have been a sign.....We decided to sit outside because it was such a beautiful day. Most of the outside area is covered with red umbrellas/awnings. I managed to sit in the one seat that was partially exposed to the sun. That coupled with the high walls which blocked the breeze, I was roasting!!!The waiter promptly took our order and brought out pita with dip. We had:- Hummus with dried meat on top - very tasty but I didn't love the crackers they gave us to dip with.- Baked eggs over polenta - tasty but not mind blowing.- Mushroom Omelette - with goat cheese and arugula. I never had an omelette like this before. It was very thin with small piles of cheese on it. It was almost like a pizza.  I didn't love it.....- Mac n Cheese - very good, both my girls enjoyed it.- Lamb slider - overcooked.

They loved the sliders, the hummus, the lamb skewers,and the short ribs.  I ordered the salmon with no oil butter just plain with steamed spinach and it was absolutely delicious.We will definitely return next time we are in New York.

1.0,5/14/2016,"We went there with a big group for a celebration... Everyone was excited for the venue but, then came the service, awful! There was no sense of urgency, care for the customer or attentiveness! And this place is not cheap so one would expect to be taken care of. Our group meal came with many things that were never explained to us, one being coffee; this was never explained to us by the server, my first cup came with bright red lipstick on the cup (dirty), only a handful got coffee and the ones that did had to beg for refills only to be barked at by the server, ""we know you want it, it's on the way!"" It never came and four of us ended up having to share coffee 2 cups between us. Also, beware of the hidden charges! 5% administration fee, what is that? When someone from our group went to ask the manager, she walked away from them only to go to a ""nicer"" member of our group to berate her and make a scene twice. Then continued to hover around our area until we left! Unbelievable! We decided as a group to not let these rude, awful people ruin the reason for us all getting together especially considering the amount of effort and love that was put into coordinating this celebration together! The end result is go somewhere else! There are many other places that would welcome you and give you at least what you are paying for!",0,1,0,Justin H.,"Atlanta, GA",110,14,3

4.0,2/4/2016,"Pera Soho was an interesting find. My partner and I were on our way to a cocktail bar and happened to stumble here first. We looked at the menu, and drinks were interesting, gut us at the apricot margarita! And we thought, well we should try it sometime, but then we saw that happy hours were until 8 pm, and it was 7:50.... So ... you know what happened next!When we stepped in, you first see the outdoor area which will be a great place to come back to when warmer, the indoor décor is a great reflection of classy and sophisticated and gatsby-ish. The sitting area with candle lights and the bar area with dim lighting, a great relax ambiance with a good staff. The bartender saw us walk in, and as the bar was a bit crowded, he still took our order and honored the happy hour prices even though he barely got to use at 8. We got the blood orange martini and the apricot margarita. Both drinks were great, I am not a apricot lover as much as I thought, but the margarita really was more of a hint of apricot, it was definitely a great cocktail and the martini had a kick of tart to it. Besides the drinks, the happy hour included Mediterranean /Greek type bites which were delightful. We ordered the beet and goat cheese dip and the pastirma -wrapped feta stuffed dates. Personally, I was expecting to like the goat cheese dip more, but found the pastirma to be my favorite! Small and yet a great balance between salty and sweet. Again, I am not a big fan of stuffed dates, but this is one I would order again and again. Only downfall was that we only get 3 small dates on a stick to share. The goat cheese dip came with interesting crackers (which I loved) but I had no idea the beets were blended with the goat cheese, and the beet flavor was overpowering for me. My partner loves beets, so it was a hit for him, but just not my thing. I let him eat the cheese and I ate the crackers though! While here, we saw some friends that were seated and having dinner, and I almost felt like eating here as well. Pera does a great job at plating and making each serving look exquisite.

5.0,9/7/2015,"For a NoHo / Village kinda girl, I really do like this spot. Stopped in at the recommendation of a friend who spoke highly of the space and the drinks. Swung through late on a gorgeous summer Friday night and got a table on the patio right away. Here's how it went down:Drinks: I got the Blood Orange Martini, friends got the Soho Blossom and something else with bourbon that I can't remember the name of but packed a serious punch. 3 different tastes, 3 satisfied ladies. We all tried each others' and were impressed. Food: Sneaked in an order for lamb sliders, fries, and smoked eggplant dip before the kitchen closed. Sliders were tender and well seasoned. Lamb can get gamey if you're not paying attention but these were perfect. Fries were good but eggplant was amaaaaazing. Always been more of a humus than a babaganoush   chick, but Pera might change my mind. After we ran out of pita we were just straight-up eating with a spoon. Service: Stellar. Our waiter was attentive and made some good suggestions. The sliders come two to a platter and he kindly had the kitchen add a third so we didn't have to have fun with food fractions. The manager, Mica, was making the rounds to check on tables, checking in with his staff and the kitchen. He popped by our table to chat for a moment and spoke highly of the waiter serving us and encouraged us to come back for happy hour. When we left he was helping the bussers move tables, really hands-on. Environment: Patio / courtyard area is gorgeous. Clean and nicely decorated. Looking forward to checking out the bar area and rooftop. Great for a wind-down to Girls' Night but would also be a great date spot. For my Jersey peeps, it was a $5 cab ride to Christopher St. PATH and for a date night, it would be a nice walk. 5/5, will go again.",4,1,4,Kelle C.,"Jersey City, NJ",232,261,82
5.0,9/5/2015,"It was a quiet Saturday afternoon in SoHo when a party of 19 walked into this restaurant. My grandma's 75th and I had no idea what to expect. We were lead into a private room in the back and offered water as soon as we were seated. The ambiance was set well and the music wasn't too loud, making for an intimate setting. Soon, the first of the pre-picked appetizers came out and little time was spent chatting as the table went to work on the hummus. Topped with sesame seeds, and just a tad of oil it was the perfect dip to go with the baked chips. Afterwards, the Lamb Flatbread ""Lahmajun"" was the perfect appetizer with ground lamb and tomatoes and after much deliberation our group decided that it was cinnamon that gave it that kick. The Mediterranean Sliders were simple, but elegant, with the perfect combination of spices that complimented the meat. I ordered the Sirloin ""Shashlik"" Steak Frites and while it was a little cold (they brought out food for 19 people at the same time, I'll let it slide) the dish was formed well and the meat was really soft. The fries that accompanied the entrée were crispy and had just the right amount of salt/garlic seasoning.For dessert, we went with the safe bet of icecream and seasonal fruit. Even though the scoop of rum raisin had some of my younger cousins frowning, I found it to be refreshing and the perfect end to the night.    As you can imagine, as the drinks poured, the toasts increased in length and the staff were very patient before bringing in the courses and taking plates away. Our waiter, Sener, made sure that the food didn't contain nuts in consideration of my brother's allergy and took care of the most minute detail.

3.0,9/1/2015,"I was surprised at first by the overall 3 star rating since it seems like a great spot, but once we sat down I knew why. The outdoor area is really fantastic. It looks like someone's beautifully decorated, decked out backyard. Some dishes were great others lacked flavor or were just way too small for the price. The service was nonexistent and when our waiter would come around he was so bland and awkward. No smile, no introduction, no small talk. When he first came over I was reading over the cocktail menu, and he grabbed it from me, showed the table then put it down away from me. We were all like OKAY - this guy is rude or just plain weird. Here's a breakdown of what we had:Beet and goat cheese dip: flavorless beet purée with one small ball of goat cheese just thrown in there. Some more goat cheese would've made this dish great. I don't recommend this one. Hummus: it was my first time trying hummus (I know, I know) and this was pretty great. Lamb dumplings: mini dumplings tossed in creamy feta, very similar to a pasta dish. Pretty good dish. Sliders: the dish comes with TWO. That's it. They're lucky they were tasty. Phyllo rolls: again only two tiny rolls served so we had to cut them in pieces to serve everyone at our table. But this dish was actually one of the better ones, although they weren't crispy at all. Portuguese calamari: best dish we had on the table (and we had about 15 plates). The batter was delish and the calamari were nice and crispy. This was the most generous serving which made it even better. One great rice (side dish): more like one greatly mediocre rice. The rice had weird texture and absolutely no flavor. Fries: bland and overcooked. Not what I expected at all. Brussel sprouts: shredded sprouts with melted manchego cheese over it. Looked similar to baked mac and cheese. This dish had good flavor. Chicken cut rolls: generous serving, nicely flavored chicken but didn't blow me away. Short ribs entree: the short ribs had a cinnamon kick and were so tender, it fell right off the fork. Parsnip purée was delish. Blue jasmine cocktail: toooo strong, yes it's actually too strong. It needed some more blueberry flavor. It tastes like straight up rubbing alcohol.*Baklava: about 4 mini pieces to the dish, but it's so sweet you don't need any more than that. The crumbled pistachios were a nice touch. Creme brulee: no crispy outer shell?? What?! Get this fake a** creme brulee out of my face... tasty creme though. --------*I've never tasted it but judging by smell of it this is what it would taste like.",3,4,2,Shirley T.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,340,1481
5.0,8/31/2015,"I organized a cocktail reception following my grad school graduation at Pera. Considering the amount of people we anticipated, we had to a full restaurant buy-out for 2 hours with open bar including beer/wine and appetizers. In the months leading up to the event, everyone at Pera was EXTREMELY helpful... they answered all questions, provided info, answered emails promptly, and helped the process go smoothly.On the day of the event, they were even more remarkable than expected! They organized the seating in a way that was conducive to socializing and sitting/eating both in the restaurant and on the patio, so it was perfect. At one point when a family was looking for more seating, they promptly set up a whole new table with full seating (seat cushions and all). They added seating on more than one occasion without any hesitation. They also helped set up TV/AV/microphone to show a video, again so helpful and wonderful. The wait staff was always attentive, appetizers/drinks were coming around constantly, and all of my classmates said they had a great experience. This wasn't an easy one to plan, but they made it way easier. I would definitely recommend them in the future for this sort of event, and will definitely return to dine!",0,0,1,Cynthia C.,"New York, NY",312,3,0

Worth trying, maybe even worth sharing instead. To start we had the hummus, was tasty but nothing out of this world. I recommend skipping it and going for something less basic. For the meal I had the Seared Greek Salmon - the Pan-seared salmon, spanakorizo and tomato gremolata made the dish. The server recommend the meat dish with fries so I plan on trying that next time.

2.0,8/14/2015,"I came here Thursday night with 4 of my girlfriends for restaurant week. While the food was okay the way we were treated the entire night was abysmal. When we got there one of my girlfriends was told by the less then friendly hostess that she had two minutes left to order a drink for happy hour. False. Happy hour was 3-7 every day and we arrived at 6:05pm. So she ended up paying double for a drink that was in fact on the happy hour menu. I, on the other hand, did not have a similar experience as I went directly to the bar and ordered a drink from the bartender off of the happy hour menu, ignoring the incorrect information we were given. About 10 minutes later my other girlfriend arrived and was told she was not allowed to order from the bar since they were closing it down for a private party and she would have to get a table in the dining area and order from there. Fine. When we were finally seated at our table we were told that happy hour is only in the bar and does not apply to the lounge area. Don't you think that since you are closing the bar off to a private party during prime happy hour time you should extend it to the people sitting at your tables PAYING YOU for their dinners?? During the middle of our meal, my girlfriend and I got up to use the bathroom and were rudely stopped in our tracks and told to go around to the other side of the patio because of the private party being held (it's important to note that you could still get into the private party from 'other side' of the patio so i'm not quite sure why we had to go all the way around). Other than that, our waiter was fine, the dessert was gross (the yogurts) and we left. Moral being, I will not return.",0,0,0,Marissa B.,"Bergen County, NJ",223,57,5
2.0,8/12/2015,"My friend and I went to this restaurant for restaurant week. This is a beautiful restaurant with wonderful decor. However, we waited quite a long time for our waiter to come and bring us water- he never introduced himself or made any pleasantries, just asked what we would like to drink, and the restaurant had like 6 people in it. Because he took so long we were ready to order by the time he came, I told him I don't eat beef or pork and asked which entree option he would recommend- the salmon or chicken. He didn't really answer right away so I said 'there's no beef or pork in either of those choices right?' And after again explaining that I don't eat either at all he said 'well the salmon has chorizo in it for flavor' (so that option was out for me and left me with the chicken). I explained to him that having meat in the seafood really limits people (I believe there is beef with the calamari appetizer also) but he didn't seem to care or be interested in my comment. I would have loved if he offered to see if they could make the salmon without the chorizo or anything like that but he didn't, I just couldn't have it. The chicken was ok, there were raisins in the rice pilaf which I hate but I know that's traditional. I know my options would have been greater had we been there for a non-restaurant week dinner but I was not impressed with the service at all from our waiter and will try the restaurant next door next time I'm in Soho.",2,0,0,S L.,"Baldwin, NY",1,27,32

Calamari was great but the chicken was served with rice that tasted like it came from the box and was hard (like the bottom of the pot).

We sat in the garden while their Sunday chanteuse serenaded us at an acceptably ambient volume that my finicky parents easily tolerated.We ordered up some scrumptious appetizers, like the phyllo rolls stuffed with kasseri cheese, pastirma- and feta-stuffed dates, lamb manti dumplings.

We just wanted to grab some drinks, and there was a four-ppl table wide open in the bar area. We went to talk to the hostess, she said just give me a couple of second and I will set it up for you. No worries, we waited. Five minutes later, nobody has ever walked over to that table to ""set it up"", and to clarify, there were already clean glasses and plates on the table, nothing dirty or leftover to be cleaned. While we were trying to get the attention from the hostess, who was standing in the courtyard and looked at tables with disgust for some reason, there's another bar table with two girls that also kept trying to get her attention, because apparently they've seen sitting there for a long time without menu. Another five minutes, we went to talk to her again, visibly annoyed, she said ""the table has to be set"" and walked away. So all things considered, ""the table has to be set"", whatever that means, and don't expect it to be ""set"" in under 10min, plus slow slow slow service, plus a hostess that obviously didn't want to be there working, I don't think I will ever be back.

If you have never been up there you absolutely must check it out on a nice day!! It is the absolutely ideal place to hold an event on a nice spring day. Finally, their staff was incredible. Since our main clientele for the event was young professionals, people were going to get a refill on drinks very frequently and to Pera's credit, they kept up and more with service.

My salmon with spanakorizo and tomato gremolata was my absolute favorite, flavorful, crispy skin and a generous portion; my date liked it more than his short ribs.The drinks were entirely inconsistent and the bar tender needs to get his or her shit together.

1.0,5/3/2015,"I really hate leaving negative reviews but I did not have a good experience here at all. This place caught our eye while we were in the neighborhood and my friend was not feeling well so we decided to stop here. It is a gorgeous restaurant and we were lucky enough to sit outside on the heated patio. The menu was not very vegetarian friendly when it came to entrees (one of my friends was a vegetarian) so we decided to stick to the appetizers. The prices were a little high for my liking but that was ok because everything on the menu seemed delicious and we each ordered a meze and a cocktail (around $14 each!). At first, one of my friends ordered the Black Jasmine cocktail and it tasted like potpurri and we all agreed that it was terrible. When we told the waiter if we could change it, he was a bit hesitant but changed it to the Mango Gimlet was really nice. I ordered the Blood Orange Martini which was nice but not worth $14 to me. I ordered the lahamajun and I did not like it at all. I have had lamajun many times  before making it at home and ordering it in NYC, and this was by far one of the worst. It was unecessarily greasy and heavy. There was too much oil. The beet and goat cheese dip was a disappointment too. The size of the goat cheese swimming in the beet puree was no more than a size of a quarter. We were all disappointed including my friend who works at Murray's cheese and loves goat cheese. The Adana kebob that my other friend got was pretty nice and the desserts my friends ordered said it was good even though I didn't order anything. I noticed when I came home that we were overcharged, we went during happy hour and were charged full price for some of the drinks and mezes we had ordered. When I came to the restaurant the next day to discuss this with an employee, the man who greeted me was willing to adjust my price. However, another man came (I'm assuming a manager) told me that he could not adjust the price because we sat at a table and not at the bar. Excuse me? I have sat in plenty of restaurants before and have been charged the happy hour price even when not sitting at the bar. Also, nowhere in the store or online does it say you need to sit at the bar. There wasn't any room at the bar for 3 more people anyways. He told me when I came back during happy hour to sit at the bar with an attitude.

The service was pretty good and the ambiance was nice. In the summer when you can sit outside, I imagine this restaurant to be even better in terms of overall experience. The one thing I can't place my finger on, is why it never seems to be crowded. There is a Pera in Midtown that always looks packed but I work two blocks from Pera SoHo and it just never seems to be full. This is disappointing because I really hope they stay in business in this location. As far as food is concerned, some highlights: the beef bacon wrapped dates are phenomenal, both kinds of phyllo rolls are wonderful, grilled hanger steak is very good, the Mediterranean pizza (which tastes like Armenian pizza is outstanding) the lamb manti is good but they serve it with a red sauce which I don't love. The only subpar items I ordered were the Mediterranean fries, that was a bad ordering choice though on my part, and the dessert was just so/so. Everything else was really excellent and fresh. I love the Mediterranean trend that is now becoming more and more pervasive, not just in NYC, but across the country. This restaurant certainly does do that cuisine and cooking style justice.",0,0,1,Justin C.,"Manhattan, NY",178,20,0
4.0,4/19/2015,"I like brunching with this one gf in particular because she always suggests a new place I have never heard of to try.  Pretty much everyone else relies on me to choose and/or at least suggest, but with her she always makes a great choice on her own initiative and it is refreshing.  This time she picked a Turkish brunch place and I was up for trying something different and I am glad I did.The male manager here is really exceptional.  They initially seated us at an outdoor table and I realized one of the seats would be directly facing the glare of the sun.  I asked a female waitress and maitre d' if we could move tables to one that was more shaded but still outdoors and even pointed at an empty two person table and they were all like, we have to ask and see, despite our having a reservation.  *sigh*Fortunately, the male manager immediately came over and said it was no problem and was very polite about making sure we were comfortable at our new table.  I noticed he opened up more of the umbrellas to make sure there was a better balance of sun/shade for all the guests.  Our new male waiter was also really polite and patient with us and didn't rush us in the least.  I only mention this because we ended up staying there for an extremely long time . . . ;PI really enjoyed their Turkish take on steak and eggs, which comes with potatoes too.  It was spicier on a whole and the steak came cut on a stick (like a kebab)!  It was very satisfying and well portioned.  And I liked the garlic pita bread with olive oil (with an actual olive in it) that comes out at the beginning just cause it was different.  My friend seemed to be struggling more with her egg/cheese/kale brunch dish I think because of the overabundance of cheese and she is a really healthy eater.  The layout of the space is nice.  It is outdoors and a cute brunch spot.  The atmosphere is airy and European chic.  You almost forget you are in New York.",0,0,1,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",138,374,294

4.0,4/10/2015,"I came here with a few gal pals after a ladies night clay-painting sesh at Color Me Mine (that could not have sounded more basic). The food here is out-of-control delicious. We had olive hummus to start, with the most amazing pita pieces I have ever had. I'm not sure what the spices on the pita were, but they tasted so uniquely salty and yummy. It wasn't too crowded on a rainy Thursday night, so we were able to get a table in the clear-tended porch area. It's decorated with twinkly lights and cozy seating. For the main course, I ordered the seared salmon with vegetable mush (technical term) and it was dope. My friend ordered the short ribs -- I had a taste and almost fell out of my chair it was so good. I would describe the whole experience as upscale MediterraneanThe staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. David the manager came over a few times to chat with us and make sure that we were enjoying everything. We ended up talking with him for a while and he even gave us a preview of the rooftop! It looks awesome, with views of the Empire State building and Chrysler building and a couple of different bench/table areas to sit. I will definitely be going back when the weather gets warmer. So, never. There may have also been group tequila shots involved...They do offer BYOB, however the corkage fee is $25. So unless you're bringing a bottle that's less than $10, it's not really worth it since the glasses of wine at the restaurant range from $12-$15.Will definitely be going back!",3,2,4,April H.,"New York, NY",74,13,24

We liked that they had an outdoor heated patio and choose to sit outside and enjoy the snowfall. Waiter 1 was quick to get our order. All was well up to this point. Waiter 1 came out with our drinks. My friend and I both ordered the Turkish apricot Bellini. Both of our glasses had LIPSTICK STAINS on it!! It was as if they poured the previous drink and just refilled it. What the f! Is this really how you run a restaurant???Waiter 2 came out with our meals. I asked him to please get us new drinks. Came back about 5 minutes later. Im surprised the owner of the restaurant wasn't informed and didnt come out to apologize himself. He should be aware that his kitchen staff is not up to par with health and safety regulations.Waiter 3 then comes out with our bottle of water. At least 15 minutes had passed at this point. Why we didnt get a bottle of water the minute we sat down is beyond me. How difficult is it to provide water? We also asked for lemons. Waiter 3 never came back out.Waiter 1 then comes out with the complimentary bread and oils after we had already been serviced our drinks and entree.. From my experience, the water and bread should be provided within 5 minutes of being seated. What kind if service is this!?! Restaurant wasn't even packed. We stayed for about an hour and half and saw maybe 6 groups leave. There was no excuse for such poor service and attentiveness!! You'd get better service at the dollar pizza guy then here!!

The food was excellent.  I had their very good take on a traditional Turkish shepherd's salad, with toasted walnuts, and my wife had Pera Vegetable Chitir, which are very thin slices of zucchini and eggplant very delicately fried, and served with a garlic yogurt dip.  Really incredible.To drink, I had a Turkish apricot margarita, very delicious.For the main course I had an very good seared salmon, but my wife's dish won the prize:  the sirloin shashlik served with rolled up soft lavash into which you could fold pieces of meat and chopped tomato and onion.  Beautiful to look at and great to eat.  Desserts were good but honestly I couldn't finish the huge chocolate mousses flavored with Turkish coffee.  This is a really elegant, fun place with outstanding food.",3,0,1,Brian H.,"Rutherford, NJ",35,29,0

The bartender comes up and told me the bar seats are reserved... Hmm okay so I stand up and go by the front.   A person (who I assume was the manager by his casual attire) told me that I could sit at one of the really tiny tables right by the front door so I sat there and waited for my friend.  The staff didn't really seem too accommodating when it came to seating because I had to approach the manager and ask about open tables.  I'm assuming they had several reservations since the place was relatively empty when I was there (except for the front of the bar.)My friend and I both ordered the happy hour blood orange martini and they were AMAZING!! A perfect combination of strong and sweet.  We were debating ordering food but ended up getting a few of the happy hour apps- both were small but tasty and reasonably priced.

Pera Soho located in Lower Manhattan on Thompson street is located in a quaint neighborhood. The restaurants around that neighborhood are SO pretty, I definitely want to try them out the next time I go in that area to shop at necessary clothing.Pera Soho does have a roof, but I was unable to go to that area because of an event, so we wiggled our way into the bar area and the outside garden like seating area. The place is very pretty, with wooden decor with a splash of red and white, the place was very modern. Note: Happy hour is only at the bar so you have to hang around by the bar before you decide to venture out to other parts of the restaurant, aka the outdoor area. At the bar, my friend and I ordered a glass of wine (White Chardonnay) and a blood orange gimlet, both were fairly decent. The happy hour special was all drinks, wine and beer for $6 and 2 for $6 appetizers. We decided to try the Babaganoush, the hummus, the fries, and the beet and goat cheese salad. The food isn't that great but for the price, I would recommend getting all except the hummus. WAS THAT EVEN HUMMUS? It was thick, grainy, looked not edible and tasted horrible. It was also weirdly warm so do not order that, please. While the lights were bright, at around 7:30 the whole bar becomes dim, and the music starts playing which was really cool! The outdoor section had cabana like seating which felt like I was on the beaches of Miami. The one annoying thing about this place was that there were many flies.

3.0,5/26/2014,"One of my closest friends at Stern (Liv) recently got engaged and a small group of us wanted to throw her a surprise engagement lunch. Another friend of mine, Beth, organized the event and made a reservation for the group at Pera SoHo.Since it was Cinco de Mayo, I chose to order an Apricot margarita with my lunch.I LOVED this drink. It was far too easy to enjoy and, given the amount of work I had to do during the rest of the day, I only had one.While we waited for our food, we were given a basket of warm, seeded rolls served with an herb butter and oil - really tasty! After looking at the menu, I decided to order the Pera Steak Burger with Kasseri Cheese.This was DELICIOUS! I asked for it to be medium and it was perfectly so - juicy and flavorful. The hand-cut fries were also awesome - I loved the addition of oregano.We sat outside since the weather was beautiful. It started to get VERY hot and I appreciated the attentiveness of the staff in propping up some of the umbrellas to provide shade.I think I will come back here for Happy Hour the menu features tapas (choice of 2 for $6) and wines, draft beers and cocktails for $6 each.Check this place out, especially if the weather is good to take advantage of the ample outdoor seating!",0,0,0,Liz B.,"Manhattan, NY",332,220,909

The food was of a quality that can be better found in other neighboring places that attend to customers much faster and the french fries leave a lot of room for improvement.

We ordered the shrimp salad. It was delicious, it was mixed very well with a dressing that was sweet yet spicy but not overpowering. The shrimp were huge and seasoned and grilled to perfection! I did however not enjoy the pitcher of mimosa I ordered, it tasted very weak like its been watered down.

Waited over hr and half for our meal, the staff is rude and do not know how to take care of their customers, the manager was running around because all the tables around us were also complaining about the service.

Also the chairs appeared to be close together, but was surprisingly spacious.We weren't on top of each other.

3.0,4/18/2014,"Love the outdoor patio here for brunch.  Really nice, clean, and secreted from the outside world.  Great atmosphere.The service unfortunately doesn't quite hold up.  It takes a millennia to get a drink, let alone your meal.The food itself was good enough.  I had the shatshuka, which, for me, was a bit over-cooked.  It basically turned into hardboiled eggs in a tomato sauce, but you can argue that this is how the should be (rather than runny), so I'll let it slide.The 'brunch cocktail' list was a little weird for me.  Very effeminate selection of Peach Margaritas, Apricot Mimosas, etc.  I decided to embrace this and have the Peach margarita, which, contrary to my previous point, didn't have a hint of peach to it.  But it was loaded with tequila, so I can't complain.Would I go back?  I'm not sure.  The $21 prix fixe is a great deal, but when you're waiting over an hour for a meal, it's inevitable that you're going to cave and get another 'brunch cocktail,' which amounts to some $14.  If you're looking for a place to lounge in the sun undisturbed with some pricey drinks, then I think it works.",1,0,0,Wes F.,"New York, NY",29,121,40

This was the complete opposite of what we were looking for. We went to the one in midtown and loved the food and the ambiance, so we decided to give the one in soho a try as well. The trio of spreads to start (hummus, tzatziki, and tahini) was great. We ordered the chicken and the sharkshuka to share. The chicken was not described very well on the menu. We expected a chicken wrap. But it was actually ground chicken and tasted nothing like we had thought. In addition, the wrap was mostly bread.

Service here was top notch and our waiter was very helpful and attentive. Based on ambiance and service alone, I would come back again....sadly the food and the price just doesn't justify another visit. The food here was terrible and the price just made it even worse. So onwards with the dishes:1. Lamb dumplings with yogurt- lamb was chewy and oh so bland!2. Chicken Shashlik- my goodness this was so bland and had absolutely no flavor. Plus the onions that came on the side with it had a terrible smell and we had to send them back because they smelled well...old. :( The chicken was chewy and not the soft melt in your mouth kebab that you expect. 3. Striped Bass- the lentils were good but the dish as a whole was very bland. There was absolutely no flavor in the fish4. Hummus- bland bland bland bland and dry....you get the idea 5. Phyllo Rolls- soggy and I can't believe they managed it but bland as well!!! Overpriced and bland food sums up the experience at Pera Soho. I am surprised to see so many positive reviews but my one star opinion is shared by 5 of my friends who were there, so I know my assessment isn't that off!

First, we asked to be seated on the roof after 10 min someone escorted us up and told us there was a prixe fixe buffet, we asked what it included and then 5 minutes later we were told the rooftop was closed for a private party. We then went to sit in the garden area which had a million umbrellas up blocking any hope for a cool breeze on a hot sunny day. We ordered a round of drinks which the manager said he would comp for the rooftop incident and those took 25 minutes to show. One of the drinks had been sitting there that it was all melted ice. Finally the food arrived, its was eh, then the bill came another 45 minutes of back and forth waiting for managers because they decided they didn't want to comp our drinks as originally offered.

I stood by the front area (host stand) for a good 10 minutes, making obvious eye contact with the bartenders and the man who seemed to be a manager. Ignored. I finally asked the bartender if I can have a table. He told me to wait at the bar until my friend arrived. Once she arrived, it was more confusion by the staff and took excessive time to be seated in a very uncrowded space. The food was decent but nothing amazing.

4.0,1/24/2014,"Chose to go here because of a NYTimes review of several months ago and a savored discount - and our wedding anniversary.  Despite the bitter cold outside, we were determined to celebrate!For better or for worse, the place was pretty empty; we had a 7:30 res & no shortage of places to sit (definitely due to the cold & the snowy remains of a storm the other day).  ANYWAY...needless to say, we did NOT sit outdoors, as so many reviewers have raved about, but the inside space is comfortable & elegant.Our waiter was wonderful, friendly & professional simultaneously, and very attentive (would he have been this attentive had the place been typically Friday-night full?  We'll have to go again to find out!).    When I asked him which he'd choose among 3 cocktails I was considering, he steered me right; the ""cordovar"" was excellent, very balanced flavors & enough alcohol to make me just the slightest bit woozy but not overly (I'm a cheap date - 1 drink is enough!).Hubby ordered the butternut squash soup & I ordered the smoked eggplant, for starters.  Soup was superb, kind of Indian in flavor, not spicy per se but with a curry-ish bite, unusual for a soup that's usually sweet.  The eggplant was much less smoke-y flavored than a usual babaganoush, which was fine by us, and very light with almost a hint of citrus that made the good-sized portion (it's listed as a small plate, not an appetizer) enough for two, served with lavash. mmmmFor main, hubby had the striped bass, served with lentils & veggies atop; he pronounced it very good.  I chose small plates: the lamb cut roll, which looked like 6 pieces of a sushi roll, but was 6 pieces of small lamb meatball wrapped in a phyllo (?) crust, with a dab of yogurt sauce atop each one.  Good kick of spice, perfectly cooked ground lamb, very flavorful.  Also had the spicy walnut muammara, which I've had spicier than that; I'd say this was the only somewhat-off note of the meal, & it wasn't bad by any measure, just not as spicy as I'd expected.  We shared a side of their roasted brussels sprouts with pistachios & kasseri cheese - you would barely know they were brussels sprouts (in case you're not a fan), & the nuts & cheese were the perfect mix-in - this was an excellent & somewhat unusual dish as opposed to how brussels sprouts are usually prepared.We were stuffed but couldn't resist splitting one dessert - highly recommend the Turkish Coffee Panna Cotta!  Would've liked more choices than only chamomile or Lipton in the decaf tea department, so we didn't bother with a beverage, but it was fine because we really were full!We'd go back even w/o the discount.  The food was excellent, a bit different (I'm always looking for something unusual within the confines of mostly meatless), and the service was also excellent.  Our only little quibble was that online there is a separate vegetarian menu (& my husband is mostly vegetarian); however, he was fine with the fish.  DEFINITELY worth repeat visits.",2,0,1,Amy K.,"New York, NY",17,206,47

We walked in and were stunned by how great the place looked and were kicking ourselves for not having discovered it before. We were greeted by the hostess and then led to our table by a Caucasian man who appeared to be the manager which politely wished us a happy meal. We were then immediately greeted by our server who politely presented himself as Luis and gave us a few minutes to scan the wine list that they had and the prefixe menu. We ordered a tasty bottle of Sauvignon blanc which he brought back to our table and served us and then took our order. We were hungry after all the shopping we had done earlier on in the day so the bread with olive oil and butter really filled the empty spot while our appetizers came out. For the meal: I ordered the fall salad as an appetizer, to start I am not a salad person but this salad was really tasty and refreshing. My sister ordered the mussel chowder which was creamy and warm which it hit the spot after being outside in the winter cold. For my entree I chose the turkey shashlik which came with a fruit chutney, the turkey was seasoned very well and juicy/tender. And last and not least dessert! It would not be thanksgiving dinner if I did not order pumpkin pie! One word: delicious!The service: My server was attentive and we never felt hesitant to ask for anything since he made us feel comfortable. It being thanksgiving dinner, as a customer we look for a pleasant place and service to dine with our family and catch up, and He did just that.

4.0,10/21/2013,"Not often is Yelp wrong, but this would be an example of where a 3-star rating is completely unwarranted. In fact, Pera is a solid 4.5 star place based on my Wednesday night visit.Upon entering, you have two options: sit inside in a trendy looking space or sit outside in the open air. Since the location is in SOHO, you can rest assured that your outdoor experience will not be consumed by the rabble common on NYC streets. We were surprised by the inclusion of a live 40's style band, playing quietly in the corner. Perfect addition.While the prices are high (this should be expected), the food is top-notch. The drinks are quite tasty as well, if not well overpriced. Lobster Risotto was the single best pasta dish I've had in years. The New Fashioned cocktail was a little contrived being that there really wasn't anything new about it. Sometimes it's better to keep in simple.

It is worth it.I ended up here last night with two best friends, their family, and two of their long time friends. So it was a big party and the servers handled it pretty well. The main highlight was was the outdoor seating. Gorgeous ambiance. Amazingly unique feel for being in the heart of SoHo. I cannot really comment much on the inside of the place, but the bathrooms were clean and pleasant. They provided us with blankets and had a fire pit going to throw off some heat and a nice smokey smell,The other factor was the food. Absolutely delicious. The calamari came with peppers and pepperoni-like meat. Love it! I am not a huge fan of eggplant anything but the cold eggplant-based dip was the best part of the entire meal. It came with simple pita chips and I could not get enough. I got the chicken breast as a main course and really enjoyed it. It was presented in a way I had never seen before, clearly Mediterranean. It was set out in a kabob like pattern but without the stick. There was delicious cheese mixed in. Everyone else enjoyed their entrees too!Remember, every place starts out with 4 stars. They either lose stars from there or do something extra special to get the fifth. So what went wrong? It really boiled down to the fact that the server did not make himself understood. He should have spoken louder and slower, given his thick accent. I do not mind accents at all but I also am interested in the specials. That said, he was very pushy with what he thought the table should order. Granted, his recommendations were all delicious and I am glad we ordered them, but they did not feel like choices. We ordered 4 bottles of expensive wine and the last round took far too long to show up. It was opened as most of us were finishing up and that did not sit well with us.

Our waitress completely ignored us - it took us about 20 minutes to order a drink (again, it was basically empty) and then she never came back again to ask if we wanted another one. She finally came back after another like half hour of waiting and said, oh did you want another one or did you want the check? Great sales tactic. Oh and the hummus we ordered came with literally 4 pita chips. We are NOT complainers (I don't remember ever complaining to a manager before) but at 15 dollars a drink, I decided to say something.

For starters, we ordered about 8 mezzes, none of which were good. The octopus was extremely dry and chewy, lacking flavor. For entree, I ordered the lobster risotto and after taking one bite I decided it better to let the $32 plate go uneaten than get food poisoning. The lobster had definitely turned rotten and the risotto was overcooked, mushy and oversalted (and this is coming from a salt fiend).

2.0,7/1/2013,"Disappointing brunch spot - here's why:Eggs Benedict - Fail on the eggs here... They were not fluffy and poached, rather cooked to a hard-boiled consistency. The spicy Mediterranean sausage was a great touch, though.  4/10 on this one. Drinks - you get one with your brunch, and they are super tasty.  The pitchers are about $36 for 4-5 glasses, so it's a good deal to take.  I had a spicy bloody and a very fresh mimosa. Atmosphere - the vibe is excellent outside. We sat at a long table under a canopy that shielded us from the strong sunlight.  The fans kept us as cool as possible in 90 degree weather. The vibe was great, but the food was not as agreeable.  Not a good brunch choice, but perhaps their other menus are a better draw.",4,0,1,Clementine C.,"San Antonio, TX",178,617,122
5.0,6/26/2013,"I don't understand Pera's reviews.  They go up and down.  I suppose it is the clientele whom either have extremely high expectations, are very picky or are simply (insert nasty word here).  I can't understand why it's such a huge deal if your cheque isn't split up right away or the restaurant wants to charge $6 more on a certain date (yes these are really in the reviews).  But what do I know?  Just your average traveling Joe who loves NYC and loves eating out more than his wife (sorry honey).  Lamb Adana still the best around.  Not a big seafood fan here so I can't speak for that since I didn't order it.  Drinks are very good, yes they could be considered a little expensive but I am not sure how that is something that is a bad thing.  Do people not look at the drinks menu prior to buying?  If you don't like it, then don't buy it.  There are some really great views of the city from upstairs.  The wooden walls provide extremely good and very ritzy privacy. The drinks are strong and are worth the $10.  There are tables and couches on the roof to hang out so it's a wonderful environment for groups or for only two people.  I would recommend this restaurant for first dates or maybe an anniversary.  As a matter of fact, my anniversary is coming up soooo..... :)",1,0,1,Nerdi G.,"Houston, TX",3,63,19

We were seated quickly - despite it being a Saturday night - and greeted quickly. This place has a huge patio with dark umbrellas, wood furniture and poofy pillows everywhere so it is almost like being at someone's garden party. Nicely shaded and protected from the street.The appetizer that I liked the most was the smoked eggplant. Not sure how they make it soo good, but I'd love to know. The shishito peppers were a close second.Though not really sticking to a more traditional Turkish dish, the Maine lobster risotto killed it - in the best way possible.

1.0,6/2/2013,"Popped by there for brunch last Sunday.  As it was almost 4 the hostess said we should order at the bar just to make sure we got the brunch order in before she seated us. The woman at the bar was incredibly rude and told us to just go sit down and we'd be served when the server came over. I tried to explain to her what the hostess had told us but she was having none of it. The hostess was really apologetic and said she'd get a server straightaway. Our server turned up and promptly legged it as soon as he gave our menus. He turned up 10 minutes later when it was actually just p past 4. He then told us we couldn't order so I told him in no uncertain terms that we were seated during brunch and we asked for it straightaway and he had disappeared for 10 minutes. The restaurant wasn't busy in the slightest. He then went to the kitchen and the kitchen said they would do brunch. I had a goat cheese omelette with arugula which was bland and I asked for a side of toast which turned up with no butter. They don't keep salt and pepper on the table.  I asked our original server for salt which I never received. The only reason I got butter is because I asked another server who stated I had to wait for our server. I was pretty insistent so she got me some. The place had five tables full out of twenty so I'm not sure why it was so hard to be served. My friend ordered an espresso and asked for it twice and never received it. The table next to us was being fawned over, probably because they had ordered more. I never not leave a tip but neither of us did. We wrote our reasons on the receipt and left. Like the other reviewers wrote, I'm not sure how this place is still open. Mediocre food, terrible service - the only saving grace is its location and decor and space itself.

1.0,5/2/2013,"Some friends and I went here for brunch on Sunday, April 28. I had recommended this place to my friends, as it had a bottomless brunch option (just what the doctor ordered!) AND a beautiful outdoor dining area on a lovely spring day.This place was a bit of a zoo this particular day. I understand demanding tables (of which there were many), and being busy. but hey, for the price tag staff should be well trained enough to accommodate. Right?We sat down, informed the waiter we would be doing the bottomless option and ordered our first drink. Hurrah!15 minutes later, still waiting.20 minutes later - Helllooooo?!25 minutes later - Finally! STRIKE 1We order food, and finish off our first round of drinks while we are waiting. We also order coffees (we have to provide some facade we're not just there to have drinks, right?).food arrives promptly, but...alas...3 out of 5 orders were wrong. i mean, really wrong. Boo. We mentioned to the waiter, who seemed indifferent and we decide to eat anyway since we're starving.STRIKE 2It was a continuing problem to get drinks (even water!), and almost impossible to get the attention of our waiter. At the end, we ordered another round, and i guess, ""The manager"" mentioned we were passed our time. Ok. He was very dismissive, and walked away. We would have been  more than willing to pay....oh, and our coffees never arrived.STRIKE 3To sum it up, don't come here expecting a true bottomless brunch (unless you want to work for it), or good service.

Everything from ensuring there were no onions in the salad to getting my parents name's correct was done with great care.On the day of the event I was showing up with my parents so had to just hope that everything was ready by the time I got there. The wine was already set and the private room looked beautiful. I was impressed how everything was taken care of by the staff and happy I was able to just enjoy the party with my family. It was as if the service was not even there, but you knew they were because your glass was never empty and the courses flowed smoothly. I was impressed how little they rushed us and were not pushy to have the check signed - I actually had to approach them which is what I would prefer in front of guests. The food was delicious - simple, tasty food. It all came out hot and at the same time (no waiting around for half the people to eat which I hate). Rice pudding with the hit of the night!

The food was basic.  Not that much different from what could be made at home in a basic kitchen.  You could hear fighting and yelling from cooks in the back of the restaurant.  Waiters were confused with orders, brought things out late or forgot to place orders.  From what I am reading below this review, it seems as if my party dined during an off day.  I hope so and if not then I need to revise my review to one star as soon as possible and file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.",10,0,1,M P.,"New York, NY",427,133,11

Brunching is a sport in New York- you expect efficiency, spectacular food, booze and service. there is also proficiency that is expected. you should know your sh*t, basically. personally, i've never worked in food service, but i've been around all types of service industries in general and i know how to supplement holes in my team and/or company. it's called BACK UP and TRAINING. we walked in for a bachelorette brunch. the minute we were seated, the server warned us that there would be no bartender, they are handling all the patrons seated OUTSIDE and we would be their last priority. at least... that's what we  heard. he also told us that they are short-staffed in general and he had 10 tables outside in the patio area and we were the only people dining inside so he'll have a hard time taking care of us. wOmP WoMp. then- we look around and see all these ""barbies"". they ask for your name, take you to the table and simply do NOTHING but walk around in their sequined tops and hot pant shorts and stand next to the DJ if they're bored. they don't bring you menus or refill your water. even when you straight up walk up to them and request for water, they stare at you blankly like a ""barbie"" doll should. our server tried. he did. our food took 1 hour later. our unlimited drinks came out in 1 hour and 10 mins. oh, just to add more salt to the wounds... the bus boys or whoever they were held the heavy ass trays of food in mid-air for 10 minutes and let the food get cold because our server wanted us to get our drinks first. PROBLEM... there is no bartender, yo!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so those guys painfully held those trays, sweat dripping down their faces until our server made each and every drink at the side table next to us. the ""barbies""... not even a word, a hand, nothing. they just stood there and stared into space as everyone in our party looked at her for some kind of reaction. THEY JUST STOOD THERE. the food- it was ok. i've had better at more humble brunch spots. i had the twice baked eggs with kale and polenta. i've made better at home, unfortunately.  i expected more and something extravagant. our private table was beautiful and in a very intimate and quiet location... it's sad that we were ignored for about  4 hours, though. in the end, the server gave us chocolate pudding to share... 4 people per pudding. =( EXTREMELY disappointed in Pera. it wasn't all the server's fault and i understand that. it's the fact that none of the floor managers have trained these ""barbie"" girls to even pour a glass of water or bring a plate of food. that's sad. they ignore your questions and don't know jack sh*t about the menu or bring a table water or menus. you're basically paying these girls to be simply be....

3.0,11/2/2012,"Full disclosure: was invited to come for a free tasting menu brunch a few wks ago during one of the last nice days of October (it hit 70 degrees!). We sat outdoors & tried a sampling of stuff from their menu and the drink list. Most of the food I tried was good & different from their uptown location. They took more liberty to expand on the Mediterranean concept with crock-baked eggs, hummus w wasabi, little lamb burgers w eggs etc. I also really liked their outdoor seating MUCH better than I liked their indoor seating. it was much more casual.. they are thinking of keeping the outdoor area open through the season. On the flipside, the indoor seating was a bit stiffer.. somewhere you'd take your parents. The service was also amazing, something you'd expect at a fancier restaurant / somewhere you bring your parents. I'm only giving it 3* because I'm not likely to return during the f/w when the outdoor seating is closed. I'm not looking for a fancy place to go & if I do, it's to more established places such as Per Se (though that would be much more $$ than Pera).",0,0,1,Joanie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,823,27

We both had no desire to travel a long distance so when we decided to go somewhere halfway between her (Nolita) and me (West Village) - Pera was the first thing that came to mind. Immediately made an OpenTable reservation and were thrilled about our decision. Our two other friends last minute decided to join us as well. We had the kindest waiter - such a nice accommodating guy. The food was all good - not outstanding but definitely very good (see past review which includes a lot of the same dishes). The unfortunate part was when the bill came. Now, let's remember that I'm someone that goes out to eat a lot as well as drinks at dinner but I was pretty stunned when we got our bill and it was $210 not including tip. So right there it's over $50 per person, two drinks, zero meat and sadly still hungry. We all put it on our credit cards and were a bit disappointed when we left. The food was good, we loved the outdoor seating but really, that was WAY overpriced. How does it make sense that a decent sized salad is the exact size price as an eggplant app (3 small balls of breaded eggplant) then more than double the price is 12 strands of pasta and some veggies.I'd love to come back here, but it will just break my bank account.",1,0,0,Harper S.,"New York, NY",546,426,7

It was a nice place and the outdoor courtyard had a bit of a magical vibe going for it. Everything was really pricy as would be expected at this kind of place, but the drink and food was good and there was no shortage of glitz.

It's really not that hard people. and when you expect a tip when I've had to wave you down all night, retrieve my own drinks menu from the bar and wait for every course, every drink and the check? not cool. And because the seating is very close together, i know from a fact we were not the only ones with these issues. Having got that off my chest, I would say the food is pretty darn good. We had the tasting / Mediterranean journey which was a good way to sample a variety of food when there were only 2 of us. Dips are my all time fave, but I prefer when they come with grilled / warmed pita, not hard crunchy fattoush, but it was still pretty good. The appetizers were ok, I'm not really a fan of deep fried anything so the calamari was a bit to greasy / heavy for me. The entree of mixed meats was amazing and the side dish of creamy smoked eggplant ""begendi"" was to DIE for. Will I be back.

The grated radish on the top were a nice way to put some health into your food as well.The green pepper was stuffed with big cut pieces of carrots, beans, tomatoes and mushrooms.  The pepper was perfectly baked - was easy enough to cut with the butter knife.  I guess it had the regular middle eastern spices and olive oil.  I don't think the labne with dill was necessary to go with this dish at all.  In fact, they should have served it with the kofte.  The labne was a disappointment anyway.The husband and the friend ordered turkey, which they served with a side of bulgur pilaf.  I am a vegetarian, but I did taste the pilaf which I believe was done in clarified butter.  It was delicious.  A must eat item there, I would say.Our server said that we were one of his favourite tables ever, sitting peacefully and contend.  We returned his making our day by letting him know that he was one of our best servers ever, as well.For more details and vivid photographs, you may visit my blog.",0,0,1,Deepika M.,Hong Kong,2,102,468

Standouts were the smoked eggplant dish, the skewered meats, and a phyllo dough dessert (not sure of the name / if this dessert made it to the regular menu). After such a fantastic first visit, I was excited to take a friend back to Pera Soho so we could enjoy their outdoor space.

The hostess (after finally showing up) decided to seat near by a bunch of trash bags even though we made it clear that we would rather sit somewhere else - she responded by saying that the bags were only full of plants, which is fine, but I'm still curious as to why the restaurant would leave such an ugly display out? Throughout our time there, we had to stand up and waive down a waiter or waitress to get anything. The table next to us seemed to share our sentiment - they had to wait over an hour to get appetizers and were asking for their check after getting tired of waiting for their dinner order.Not sure what went wrong at Pera Soho - the restaurant is in a great location and has great menu potential but seems to be falling apart.",10,1,1,Saara H.,"Manhattan, NY",80,138,0

Now, both locations have a very modern warming feel to them; however, Soho definitely has a bit more character.  What really stood out was the trolley mural in the dining room.When we got there, we were immediately greeted by Burak (the owner), which was nice to meet in person.  The waiters were quick to see us and offered us a drink right away.  He came back with what was called Pera Rikki (sp).  Very refreshing...again, wish the weather was nice enough to enjoy that drink in their outdoor terrace.We sat down promptly at 7:30, and out came the food.  I am breaking this down into all the dishes that were served with my own comments (photos to be posted shortly after this review):APPETIZER 1.  Grape Leaf Chips with Muammara - These chips totally made this dish.  And the muammara complemented them quite well.  The chips were just simply deliciously crispy in a very delicate way, and melted in your mouth!APPETIZER 2.  Calamari - Crispy, and love it when the tentacles are included.  And beware of the peppers they include in this.APPETIZER 3.  Hummus - Definitely one of the best hummus I have tasted anywhere.  Served warm.APPETIZER 4.  Lamb Adana Medallions  - AH MAY ZING!  This is a MUST have!SALAD - Pera Soho Salad - which had cherry tomato halves, cucumbers, onion, parsley.  Refreshing.  A bit too acidic for me...but refreshing.EGG PLANT PUREE - One of the creamiest puree dishes I have tasted.  Exquisite.ENTREES - Which included a turkey kabab, duck kabab and a fish dish.  They were all very delicious, especially the kababs.  The only gripe I had was the fish, which had a scale in it.  That turns me off a bit.Excellent job, and glad to have an option in Soho for Pera as well.  Being brand new, I do still love their innovative ways of serving traditional dishes.  Now I can't wait to come back and try a happy hour at their outdoor patio!",1,1,2,Jacob Y.,"New York, NY",184,466,120

4.0,3/18/2012,"I recently had the pleasure of an invitation to a tasting dinner at newly opened Pera Soho, an Eastern Mediterranean restaurant at the corner of Thompson and Broome Streets. A group of about 30 foodies piled into the beautiful private dining room after sipping wine and specialty cocktails. Course after course, we were wined and dined with selections off their winter menu, and a few new additions to their spring menu.We started with grape leaf chips (grape leaves dipped in tempura batter and fried) served with muhammara, a Middle Eastern walnut and pepper dip. The flavor of the grape leaves shined even with the unique crunchy texture that one would not normally expect. The dip was a great compliment not only to the chips, but also to the baskets of pita served at the start of the meal.Their Portuguese calamari was nice and crunchy, with thin slices of chorizo along with the traditional hot peppers. Even with just the slightest tweaking to a typical calamari recipe, this version stood out as a solid choice for starters.The hummus was pretty incredible. It was actually served warm, a rarity, along with some basturma (a Middle Eastern cured beef). Definitely not boring in flavor and presentation. Would love more of this.We also started out with some lamb ""Adana"" cut rolls, which are their sushi-like presentation for a ground lamb kebob wrapped in lavash. My family makes our kebobs very similar to this, and it was a very comforting flavor profile and creative presentation.Next we tried some of the Pera Soho salad, which was a simple mixture of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, parsley, walnuts, and pomegranate seeds. Although it had some unique twists to a traditional Middle Eastern salad, unfortunately it was a touch on the bland and boring side compared to what we had experienced thus far. Definitely not worth the $12 price tag it would normally cost.Our first main course consisted of pistachio-crusted red snapper with a vegetable turlu and saffron broth. The texture of the fish was perfect, a nice bit of crunch from the topping, and incredibly tender within. The sauce was a lovely compliment as well. I wish the fish itself was seasoned just a bit more.Next we had some delicious bulghur pilaf made with whole bulghur wheat (not the cracked kind) and tomatoes, which was a true taste of home. My mother makes pilaf white similarly, and this was spot on when it comes to flavor and texture. Maybe I loved it more than the others because it tasted like home, but I honestly really loved this side dish.An incredible surprise was discovered with the smoked eggplant puree. It was not your typical baba ghanoush experience. Instead, this smoked eggplant was pureed with melted kasseri cheese and cream, giving it a decadent flavor and texture. I have every intention of returning for this dish alone, and trying to replicate it in my own kitchen. It was outstanding in both flavor and texture.Now we start with the three new shashlik additions to the spring menu. They were testing out these flavors so I'm not sure if all of them will officially make it to the final menu, but I will comment on them all regardless. First up we tried a turkey shashlik, which everyone mistook for chicken. A really nice surprise, as turkey is a rare contribution to an Eastern Mediterranean/Middle Eastern menu.An overall favorite was the incredible duck shashlik. It was skewered not only with bell peppers, as the other two were, but also with thin slices of fresh apricot, which imparted a wonderful tart/sweetness. The duck meat itself was outstandingly tender and flavorful. This was easily a highlight of the entire meal.We also had a wonderfully tender and flavorful beef ribeye shashlik. It was marinated in a variety of delicious herbs that really stood out in this medium-rare presentation. Even though beef is a fairly typical choice, the version here is worth trying.Finally, we reached the ending, and thus the dessert course of our tasting. A delicious kunefe was my favorite of the two options. Basically a sweet cheese-filled katayef, it's one of my favorite desserts in general, and their execution was spot on. I would easily order this dessert on a future visit.We also had some poached pears with pistachio cream. It wasn't bad, but paled next to the other dessert. A few of my companions complained a slightly bitter flavor, although I think it was just the wine selection in poaching the pears. Perhaps a little more sugar would have cut through that background note.In any case, I'm so grateful to have been part of this tasting experience. Not only can I recommend the food here, but I also look forward to warmer months when the incredible outdoor seating area is open. It is definitely worth stopping in for some well executed food and great service.",4,0,3,Victoria K.,"Cranston, RI",579,664,2519

5.0,3/11/2012,"I was lucky enough to get invited to tasting here the other night.  It's like winning the lotto - except for foodies.  There was a whole bunch of app's = hummus (love!), fried greek leaves and fried calamari.  There was fish, lamb, turkey, beef, duck - foodie heaven.  The best part of the night was the eggplant.  I'm not sure what they did to it but it was creamy, buttery and cheesy.  Dessert was shredded phyllo dough with a touch of honey - good texture and not overly sweet.I've been to the midtown location and this place is superb.  Good outdoor seating - can't wait to go back in the summer!",1,0,1,Julie Y.,"New York, NY",140,322,2
4.0,3/9/2012,"I was invited by Burak and team to the tasting event for their next season's menu.It was an absolutely lovely evening.  I made new friends and enjoyed a fabulous multi-course meal that surprised and delighted me.  We had a variety of starters including salads, hummus and other spreads.  One of my favorite dishes was the snapper encrusted with pistachios.  It was a really interesting combination of flavors that worked well. My favorite dish was this creamy smoked eggplant puree with cheese.  It was heavenly.  Very light consistency and almost felt like a whipped potato.  It was so delicious, our table was asking for more!  Then the variety of kebobs came out.  Burak kept us guessing because they looked like chicken,pork and steak but ended up being turkey, duck and beef.  They were really juicy and fresh.  Everyone was enjoying the meats. Lastly, the dessert was very special.  There was a dish with shredded phyllo dough and cream.  It was perfect.  Not too sweet or gooey but just enough that kept you wanting one more bite.  The bar area looked very inviting and the outside enclosed entrance seems so nice for warm weather.  I will definitely be bringing some friends back!",4,0,1,Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",816,852,812
4.0,3/8/2012,"Very nice ambiance.  Although too cold when we visited the outdoor seating looks like an ideal place to have an after work drink.  The lamb dish I chose was one of the best lamb dishes I have had.  On the down side, the chef is not aware of how to make a ""soft boiled"" egg.  All in all, I would recommend trying this restaurant.",0,0,1,Zachary S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,10,0
4.0,3/8/2012,"Australia. Germany. Japan. Morocco. Neverland.These are all places I've yet to visit, but would love the chance to explore someday. Call it a short list of sorts. However, after dining at Pera SoHo, we may very well have to slip Turkey into this elite selection set.My recent feast at this new and trendy Mediterranean hot spot was quite the gastronomic adventure. I was fortunate enough to sample a few future items for the upcoming season, and in my humble opinion, the restaurant would be smart to position their decadent kebabs as the Pera SoHo speciality and give 'em their own section on the menu. The Turkey (I'm talkin' about the bird this time) and Beef Rib Eye Shashliks were both delicious, but they couldn't touch the Duck Breast - thick, tender slices skewered between grilled peppers, and glazed in a sweet marinade. Plus, these dishes' versatility as either entrees or sharing plates gives you little excuse to pass on 'em.The Lamb Adana was a notable small plate, thick phyllo wrapped around robustly flavored hand-ground meat and cut into a set of six pieces, reminiscent of sushi rolls. The Portuguese Fried Calamari was lightly breaded and tossed with chorizo, the Iberian sausage adding a hearty twist to the otherwise standard appetizer. I could've done without the Grape Leaf Chips, which were wafer-thing and crumbled far too easily - although the muammara (hot pepper and walnut sauce) it was served with came in handy to spice up my squid. The Pistachio Crusted Red Snapper was similarly bland, however, the dish's asparagus baked in fish broth was tremendous. But the scene-stealer of the mezes was their Creamy Smoked Eggplant Puree, for sure - a plate that seemingly subbed out the yoghurt filling for cheese. Its consistency, almost that of a very melted brie, was not what I was expecting, but was surely the most pleasant surprise of the night. And while I am not much of a dessert whore*, Pera SoHo's Over-Baked Kadaifi ""Kunefe"" could change my prudish ways. I typically despise anything being described as ""orgasmic"" (we can blame my shame-driven Catholic background), but here, I see no way around it. This Turkish delicacy is essentially a cheese-filled pastry covered in bird's nest shredded phyllo. It's warm, it's sexy, it's - yes, orgasmic. And now I feel dirty. But damn, was it worth it.Ahem. I digress.The private dining room is bound to come in handy for big parties - be it birthday celebrations or business dinners. And the main area's decor is romantic without the overkill, accented by espresso browns, sandy tones, damn comfy chairs, and a tram mural on the back wall that looks like it belongs in one of those vintage travel posters. And now that I think about it, I've been noticing way more Turkish Tourism Board advertisements than usual since this dinner. Subliminal much?Anyway, the service was excellent and the entire staff more than accommodating.  Mark my words - if you haven't heard of Pera SoHo, come the warm weather, you most certainly will. The expansive outdoor patio space just before you enter the establishment is begging for a party. Complete with more tables and chairs than some entire indoors restaurants in the area, all that's missing here is the attractive happy hour crowd. And given its primo location, it's sure to find it when spring and summer roll around. Count on their Pera Rickey (rum, sour cherry, rosemary, lime) to be the go-to cocktail, a refreshing, semi-tropical drink that'll come in handy when beating the heat. Consider yourself in-the-know, now.*You can call me a whore, just not a dessert whore. I have my limits, you know.",10,8,8,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148
4.0,2/22/2012,"I was very skeptical b/c of the reviews but glad I went. Pera is very new and I am glad to inform the food was very, very tasty. We had Mediterranean-ish tapas plates and they just had an extra ""zing"" that made them different than the rest. Their hummus IS AWESOME (prepared with some kind of sausage, Pastrma I think). Hands down the best hummus I've had.Beets and got cheese were outstanding and the Black Manhattan was slurpy cool (ask for Russian Standard vodka).Needs a little more ambiance but hey.... they just opened. Servers were on point btw.",2,0,1,David R.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,34,0
2.0,2/12/2012,"What a disappointment. The only excuse this restaurant may have could be that it's new and our waiter claimed it was his second day. He clearly had too large of a section for himself but even so, the bus boys and other servers didn't seem to have a clue as to what they were doing. It was restaurant week (we did not know that going in) so that may have had something to do with it.The food was mediocre at best. We were a group of 9 so I was able to taste a few different things (dumplings, chicken, sea bass) but nothing impressed me. Some of my party ordered from the restaurant week menu but some my the party did not. The place doesn't know if it wants to be Turkish, Italian or Mediterranean. When the entrées came out we were missing 2, by the time the final 2 meals came out everyone else had finished eating. The restaurant didn't even bother comping the meal or giving a discount. A side dish never showed up and I had to ask the waiter to make sure he took it off of our bill. I enjoy eating out and I don't mind spending the money but in this particular case the meal did not justify the cost.",0,0,0,Victor C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0
5.0,2/11/2012,"My wife and I met some friends at Pera's new location in SoHo and we all were overwhelmed with the atmosphere and menu.  We started with drinks at the bar where the bartender was very creative and made cocktails that set the mood for the entire evening.  I must recommend the lamb adana - by far the best adana we have had in NYC!  The rest of the table was also very happy with their selections, ranging from the hangar steak to the branzino to the salmon wrapped in grape leaves.  Everything we ate took us all back to the mediterranean and left us wanting more!  We finished the evening with the chocolate pot de creme and it was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal.  The staff was very helpful and not intrusive, just the right mix you want when dining out.  My wife and I are looking forward to the summer where the beautiful outdoor space will be a perfect location to enjoy a great meal outside in NYC.  I highly recommend this new location, along with the original location in Midtown.",0,0,1,Brian P.,"Clifton, NJ",0,1,0
4.0,1/30/2012,"So much food so little time, where to begin... OK first upon arrival I saw the great outdoor space this place has, it's huge, looks intimate and will defiantly be hopping come spring, but now it's Jan so let's get inside.A mix of warmth and sleek design, not an easy thing to pull off but they did it.  The lines are clean and very trendy, softened by the warmer colours and maybe just maybe the lighting over the bar, which caught my attention was the cause either way off to a good start.  Very nice bartender and hostess to greet the hubs and I, we were meeting a friend and 3 soon to be,  who were already seated at the bar awaiting our arrival.We were seated in a cozy little nook for 6, located just off the coat check, very nice room and as someone mentioned when we first arrived, great lighting for pics.a quick look at the menu and we decide to order a bunch of stuff among the chosen were:The bean spread they give with bread (hot and flavorful pockets of goodness), started things off with the promess of a good mealWarm Hummus with PastrmaFried White Anchovies w/ Olives and GrapefruitLamb ""Adana"" Cut RollSmokedSmoked Eggplant w/ Garlic YoghurtCAULIFLOWER SOUP  grilled radicchio, hazelnut and golden raisin  KALE AND FRIED CHICKPEA SALAD  radish, piquillo peppers, smoked almonds, currants,pickled red beet eggsPERA'S SIGNATURE FRESH LAMB ""ADANA""  hand ground daily and marinated with eastern mediterranean spicesSLICED SIRLOIN ""SHASLIK""  grilled red and green peppers, sweet onions and bulghur pilafMEDITERRANEAN FRIES w/ SEA SALT & HERBSGRILLED BRANZINO  slow roasted squash and basil confit I was extremely pleased overall (tried everything but the lamb as I'm not a lamb lover)  however the stand outs of the meal for Moi were, the Fried anchovies, just awesome , love this and it was served in a fresh mixed green with  arugula, it was a little heavy on the dressing but still very good,The Kale dish was also a really good one,  I love kale and the mix with a smoky almond and currents set it off really nicely Then the sliced sirloin, to die for, the meat was perfectly cooked and to say it melted in your mouth would be the understatement of the year, BTW, the portion is very big so lots to eat and share.The french fries were also so very good.The waitress was the sweetest, and we really appreciated her suggestions and her attention to detail, we were never left wanting and her friendly disposition was endearing.They graciously sent us some dished to sample ,they saw we were serious eaters and having so much fun they got caught up in a moment.  They sent us some grilled baby calamari and a most flavorful Tuna tartar.  I am a big tartare head thus I am rarely impressed but this one had flavor  ( like the still unidentified herb, which was green , peppery and so unique), combined with and nice chunks of tuna, taking  it up a notch, bravo.Two reds were served and all in all an, amazing meal to rememberBravo well done and cheers to Perapics to follow",1,0,1,Valerie G.,"Montreal, Canada",172,284,88

4.0,1/11/2012,"Having eaten at the Pera in midtown Manhattan, my expectations were pretty high for the Soho location. Even though it is the dead of winter, I was very impressed by the outdoor space. It's going to be killer during the summer months! The food was great - the signature lamb adana dish is the one not to miss. I do not eat lamb but this is the only lamb I will eat. The tempura grape leaves were also impressive. My date is a huge kale fan and he would not stop raving over the kale salad. The ceviche was not available the night we went, but we did end up having some seafood, sharing the halibut and striped bass. These guys definitely know how to cook a mediterranean fish! I think they're still working out the kinks in the menu and service, but overall the restaurant is lovely, with a nice bar area. It's a little more on the formal side - I definitely would not walk in wearing my yoga gear - but a fabulous addition to an already great neighborhood.",2,0,1,Lisa L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0

Highlight of the evening - the dill studded fluke and the pistachio ice cream.The chocolate pot needs more work but the staff was super friendly and attentive and probed for feedback -Pera was a wonderful reminder of how great Mediterranean cuisine can be when executed well.
