5.0,4/19/2019,"DELICIOUS. Excellent service, friendly manager & lovely inside. Some restaurants are too loud or boisterous and this was not the case. Our dishes: Octopus was cooked perfectly, not the best octopus we've had, though. My husband loved the Soup Poisson.The lobster pea risotto was delectable. BUT THE SCALLOPS. Best scallops I have ever had. Melt in your mouth good with a ridiculous chorizo citrus vinaigrette. My husbands pappardelle pasta with rabbit confit was also divine. The rabbit was bursting with flavor. The manager found out it was my birthday and gave us a complimentary dessert- so sweet! Definitely recommend.",0,0,0,Kelly B.,"Old Town, San Diego, CA",1,24,18

They really want to make you happy and satisfy They have many servants, and you won't wait more than 15 sec for your service.Bread and olive oil was served immediately when you seated, but sadly Bread is so so so dryHave the Octopus as appetizer, it turned out really good! Balanced, but it is a little bit pricy for the portion.Ordered lemon saffron linguini as entree with request of light oil, but it is a little bit salty and the linguini is under cooked.  After I finished all, I can not remember what I ate at all.

4.0,3/30/2019,"Had brunch with a couple of friends during a recent stop in NYC.  Very nice spacious and welcoming room.  It was a lovely calm setting which facilitated catching up with friends without a ton of noise or hub bub (yeah, I do seem to be entering a new, more crotchety phase of life).We started off with some cocktails and a bottle of wine, as brunch is really just an excuse for some quality day drinking.  Coupled with a few lovely appetizers for the table we got things off to a good start.The menu is kind of Mediterranean infused traditional brunch.  We had a delicious plate of mezze (the falafel was really outstanding), some Taramasalata (also yummy), and Sardine Escabeche.  Ok, so maybe the menu is less traditional than I first indicated but it was a lovely and relatively light weight to start the meal.  I had the Moroccan ""Eash"" for my main - crab, egg, spinach, crème fraiche, it was unique and a nice antidote to a more traditional egg dish. My wife had Shakshouka which was great and I found myself wondering why it isn't a brunch stable, it's kind of a natural.Terrific meal, lovely room, nice service.  A winner all around.",0,0,0,Alex B.,"Glencoe, IL",153,222,110

Arrived early on Saturday night (4:30) and we were welcomed to the bar where I had a memorable margarita and one with dinner as well. At 5:00 the friendly hostess immediately came over and showed us to our table. Our fabulous waiter Harold was already there waiting to tell us the specials of the day. He couldn't have been more helpful, lovely and attentive, giving us menu suggestions and checking on us throughout our meal. Our appetizers were divine- moroccan flat bread, a special tuna appetizer, and the hummus, babaganoush, and falafel. Our main was simply out of this world- the Dover Sole- prepared exquisitely with a delicious cauliflower side dish. Chocolate cake and date biscuit for dessert were incredible.

3.0,3/2/2019,"We've loved this restaurant: early dinner a few times; I recommended to a board I'm on to do dinner in a private room downstairs; and late night half price pasta hour after the theatre -- all good until last night. Went in for pasta after Lincoln Center play -- pasta just okay this time but after asking for the bill, several minutes later the waiter walked up with it, opened the booklet to look in, turned as he said he'd be right back. When he returned the pasta prices were $34 and $35 dollars rather than half price -- what was he checking? He said he'd try to fix it and 7 or 8 minutes more went by as we stood in our winter coats by the table. Finally he returned with the correct bill about 20 minutes after we requested it.

5.0,3/1/2019,"A friend of mine had been wanting to try Boulud Sud for a long time, so I decided to give this restaurant another shot (the general manager also kindly reached out to me and encouraged me to return). Well, I'm happy to say that my lunch this time was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with constant smiles. Everyone was so kind and attentive, and our waitress constantly checked up on us the whole meal to make sure that we were enjoying everything (complete contrast to my previous experience, during which my waiter never came by once during the whole meal). The food was also absolutely delicious! We started off with some champagne and some chips with 5 different types of dips - all of them were delicious, but my favorite was the Babaganoush. This restaurant makes Babaganoush and falafel particularly well. My friend and I both got the Express Lunch deal, which is a really good deal when you look at the a la carte prices. We only paid $26 each for both a soup and an entree. The soup of the day was cauliflower soup, which was surprisingly much better than expected! I'm not really sure what I expected to taste with cauliflower soup, but this one was so creamy and smooth, just the way I like it. For my entree, I got the Harissa Lamb Burger to try something new. I was pleased with the taste and really savored the combination of both lamb and eggplant in the burger, along with some saganaki cheese that I always enjoy. They came with spiced fries, which tasted just like regular fries, nothing too special about them. My friend loves saffron and ordered the Lemon Saffron Linguini, which she said was really good as well! Overall, I was very happy I returned for a second chance at Boulud Sud because the lunch could not have been any better, from the service to the pace to the food. Thank you again for a wonderful lunch! Perhaps my poor brunch experience a few weeks ago was just an unlucky day. After this amazing experience, I can now say that I would certainly return in the future.",0,0,0,Jung Y.,"New York, NY",392,35,178

I am a big fan of Cafe boulud, and I love love their fish wrapped in lightly fried potato on top of baby leek. I think the boulud restaurants are the best at using leeks and potatoes.

4.0,2/7/2019,"Too be honest the starters and the service are around average.Luckily, the fish roe sauce with chips was the one that is slightly better. The red shrimp starter we had was too sour and lack of taste.However, what bring this place to 4* are its main courses and desserts. I really like the main courses and the dessert here. Lamb chops were very nice. They came with a grilled lemon and sour cucumber yogurt sauce. In addition, the quail was very outstanding. The bones were gotten rid of. In addition, they use the quail meat to wrap a piece of foi gras inside. Delicious!The dessert we had was Grapefruit Givre. This is the classic dessert. It has a mysterious sugar on the top and grapefruit sorbet inside.

4.0,1/25/2019,"Came here for Restaurant week. It was crowded. Sat down and we ordered. The pasta was very very good. It is made in house and came with a decadent cheese sauce. They topped it off with truffles. Very tasty, a nice tartness with saltiness. I'm glad I shared with my friend because it was rich. The mezze was okay, nothing special. I didn't like the falafel but the baba ganoush was creamy and flavorful. Hummus was normal. Our mains: my friend loved her chicken. You could taste the cinnamon and other unique flavors it was marinated in. The lamb was gamy and rich in flavor. I really enjoyed the sauce it came with.We also ordered flatbreads and they were very good: crispy bread with different toppings but the flavors blended well together.Dessert was very comforting.

5.0,1/11/2019,"He's said really great things about this place, so I was pleasantly surprised when he made us a reservation one Sunday afternoon. We had brunch, so perhaps not what they're known for, but if the overall quality holds, most certainly everything they do is pretty phenomenal.Ambience: Warm and welcoming interior. It wasn't terribly crowded at 3PM on a weekend, but just full enough to feel like one of a few very special guests.   I had the ricotta pancakes and he had French style scrambled eggs. The pancakes were delicious - light and fluffy with a lemon curd on the side. The eggs were amazing, in the French style of course. So good that we almost didn't notice the brioche was missing, until about halfway through the meal, when another waiter brought to our table.After dinner coffee was wonderful.

4.0,12/30/2018,"Boulud Sud is a Mediterranean oasis in the midst of the UWS, and while I cannot speak to its overall representation of the Mediterranean flavor and taste, I can attest to its excellent service and environment and fantastic execution of the Porcini Mushroom Soup and the Grilled Steak & Eggs. I arrived on the last Sunday of 2018, ready to end my year with a wonderful brunch. The hostess was courteous, offering to check my coat at the door before leading me and my friends to our table. Our waiter was very polite but service only ran slightly short of impeccable as he was slow to take our orders and bring us our check at the end of the meal. The Porcini Mushroom Soup was delicious, with a strong mushroom flavor and garnished with crunchy croutons and chestnuts. It was very straight-forward, and I think the dish would have benefitted from some additional spice and an extra kick.The grilled steak and eggs was a dish made to perfection, arriving on a bed of potatoes. Although the steak was likely the centerpiece of this dish, it was the potatoes that shone for me. The eggs on the side of the dish were a bit dull, and once again, I believe I would have enjoyed a more interesting take or interweaving of that ingredient in this dish. Nonetheless, it was all very well done and I truly enjoyed finishing off the plate.Although I wouldn't say the meal was very memorable, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I certainly wouldn't mind coming back again.",1,1,1,Isabelle W.,"New York, NY",373,22,18

4.0,12/13/2018,"tl;drSolid overall -- interesting take on Mediterranean flavors, however still some room for improvement.---This was actually our first venture into the Boulud family of restaurants in NYC (I actually have never been to Daniel!) and so we were actually fairly excited. The way we see it, there's the top-tier of fine dining establishments (EMP, Le Bernardin, Daniel) and then there's a middle-tier of nicer restaurants (Gramercy Tavern, Frenchette, Blue Hill). Boulud Sud fits nicely into the latter tier.I really appreciate the availability of reservation spots, since we were trying to book a last-minute birthday celebration and were able to get a weekend dinner rez just 2 days out. The restaurant is surprisingly close to Lincoln Center (makes sense with all the pre-threatre dinner reviews below) and elegantly appointed.Overall, the service is great. Servers generally made sure that we were not without drinks and cleared the table at appropriate times, so no complaints there.However, the food did leave a bit to be desired. I think the competition among this ""middle-tier"" of nicer restaurants in NYC is intense, and you've gotta step up your game to compete in this arena. New chefs with great talent are popping up all the time, and to stay relevant and fresh the menu has to be innovative and balanced.Here were the dishes we ordered:TARAMASALATA - salted cod roe with housemade dill chipsThis is one of our favorites from Greece, and it is done well here. However, the housemade dill chips were much too salty. Given the dip itself is salty, you can serve a ""neutral"" chip and still have a great dish.GAMBAS AL AJILLO - prawns in olive oilThis is a classic Spanish dish, and although the prawns themselves were good, the seasoning itself also left some to be desired - there could be more garlic and less parsley. Its is gambas al ajillo after all, not gambas al parsley. :PCRISPY AUTUMN SQUASHThe comments above are generally quibbles, but this is a seriously perplexing dish to appear at a restaurant of this caliber. Sure, no big complaints with the flavor, but the portion of this is immense and seemed kind of out of place on the table. The batter is on the medium-heavy side, so to present a dish with this much grease seems kind of heavy-handed (our group of 3 struggled to finish this). I think the batter itself can be made much lighter or the portion simply reduced. This is essentially like a Japanese-styled kakiage, but I have never seen a rendition of kakiage be this heavy.RYE CAMPANELLE with uni and crabThis is actually super tasty - great combination of flavors balanced with the savoriness of the uni and the crab :)BRANZINO, grilledAlso grilled to perfection, appreciate the skilled filleting techniques of the waitstaff.GRAPEFRUIT GIVREAs good as everyone had mentioned :) Very creative and innovative dessert -- what a delight to explore the different layers packed into a frozen grapefruit. Thanks for also remembering the candle and my wife's name :)I got two cocktails, the Manhattan and From the Field. The Manhattan was so-so (balanced, but not quite worth the $18 -- it was too sweet maybe from the addition of the Lillet Blanc). From the Field literally tastes like walking through a grassy field filled with lavenders, so I must compliment the beverage team at crafting such an enjoyable cocktail.So, yes, overall this restaurant does deserve its 4 stars, but there were several misfires. I would hazard to say that in my experience with restaurants of similar caliber in NYC, it's hard to find more than one fault in a single dinner. I feel like I'm coming across as snobbish, but in such a competitive dining market as NYC and when you're charging $20 per appetizer and $40 per entree, can you afford mistakes?Regardless, look forward to exploring Cafe Boulud and Daniel in the future!",0,0,0,Chris S.,"Manhattan, NY",92,144,703
4.0,12/10/2018,"Chef Daniel Boulud's ode to Mediterranean flavors is well conceived and executed. The menu is harmonious with the theme, yet retains a fine dining sensibility, employing classic Mediterranean spices and flavors in unexpected ways. Quite innovative use of classic ingredients with nuance. Wine program is similarly well done, with high quality choices from the region that pair perfectly with the menu. The dining room, which can get quite full before events at Lincoln Center, is comfortable and staff were all very affable. It was also a treat to see Chef Daniel Boulud in the flesh on the line and in the dining room. Overall, yet another solid experience. It may lack the downtown trendiness factor, but no doubt Boulud Sud offers a solid experience.Atmosphere- Upscale dining room retains a sense of warmth with its Mediterranean tones; not overtly formal, despite the classic white tablecloths.- Enjoyed the open kitchen, which adds personality to the space.- Many two tops are spaced rather close together, but the seats along the window are great.- Before 8pm, very full with pre-theater crowd (skewed to more mature demographics) after which the space became more relaxed.FoodBefore 7pm, one must order from the three course prix fixe ($65) which includes an app, main and dessert. Sides and shareable plates are also available at their usual cost. Though some of the spices and dishes may sound rather exotic at first, ingredients are employed with an even hand and add depth without overwhelming. Everything we had was flavorful and executed with high quality. We enjoyed:- Mezze (Spicy Moroccan Hummus, Herb Falafel, Babaganoush): Classic spreads, hard to go wrong. The baba in particular was quite tasty.- Ricotta Gnocchi (Roasted Wild Mushrooms, Brussels Sprouts, Hazelnuts *Special* - $3 supp.): Like fall on a plate. Gnocchi was dense and heavy, but the flavor combinations were so spot on, it was hard not to enjoy.- Za'atar Grilled Sea Bass (Wheatberry, Medjool Dates, Walnut Tarator): Za'atar added flavor in just the right way, moist and not too fishy. Wheatberry an outstanding side. Recommend.- Wagyu Beef (Short Rib ""Kataifi,"" Brown Butter-Celery Root Purée, Tuscan Pepper Jus - $12 supp.): Cooked flawlessly. Enjoyed the duo treatment with short rib kataifi. Puree was also quite enjoyable. Recommend.- Grapefruit Givre (Sesame Halva, Rose Loukoum, Grapefruit Sorbet): The crisp tartness of the Grapefruit is an excellent palate cleanser and refreshing conclusion.- Pecan Malabi (Traditional Persian Custard): Agreeable, though didn't seem to have the punch of flavors delivered from other dishes.BeverageBoulud Sud does an excellent job on its wines by the glass program. The menu is filled with interesting finds rarely seen by the glass. Of course, the options are Mediterranean in focus highlighting France, Italy and Spain. The 2016 Roagna Langhe Bianco ($15), a blend of Chardonnay and Nebbiolo, was a particularly unique find for a wines by the glass list and quite enjoyable. The 2015 Petitot 'Terres Burgondes' Côté de Nuits-Villages ($19) was also a solid choice.Service- Personable and accommodating all around.- Quite attentive to time constraints for those visiting nearby Lincoln Center.- One nit: realized after the fact, we were charged accidentally for the desserts even though they are included in prix fixe, likely due to our waitress being pretty new.",0,0,0,D.

And we sure did in this case!Knowing nothing about it, and just stumbling across it on a trip to a college open house, we do know we like Mediterranean so in we went.What a find! I won't go into all the gory details of the dishes we enjoyed, and we didn't drink any booze, it being early afternoon with a long drive home ahead of us, but I was very impressed with: the quality and cleanliness of the establishment, the quality of the ""ambiance"" (air was nicely cool, fresh, noise level subdued, general mood positive and relaxed) the attentiveness of the service (SO hard to find...), the presentation of the dishes and creativity of the menu.The restaurant business is brutal, I know that first-hand, but so many times I dine somewhere that if they'd only attend to the details (i.e. a quick check of the restrooms once an hour) the experience would be so much better.

4.0,9/16/2018,"Brunch with out of town guests from Sweden, had a reservation for 4 and asked the hostess if we can sit outside in the beautiful likely last sunny day of summer. The food and staff throughout the meal were both amazing. Warmest table staff. The stark contrast was the hostess inside the restaurant where we checked in first for my reservation. I asked if we can be seated outside since the weather was beautiful, and if it's possible to phone the staff outside so we don't have to walk back and forth around the block to check ourselves, since we have elderly guests with us. The hostess looked so annoyed, rolling her eyes and appearing so inconvenienced that it made us all feel like we were the biggest troubles of her career and ruined her life. Her attitude since going to check on the table for us continued to be icy and dismissive, even when I explained to her that I appreciated her help especially given the elderly guests I had with me. It was truly embarrassing. Having grown up in nyc, whenever friends and guests visit from out of town, especially out of the country, i take pride in this city my hometown, and like to show everyone what I love about this place- the food, the people, and usually amazing service when dining out. We were all absolutely appalled by her attitude and unprofessional behavior. Hosts are guests' first impressions of an establishment. It is such a shame.",1,0,1,Tao X.,"Manhattan, NY",2,4,0

1.0,8/30/2018,"Bolud Who?There are a few things that one expects from a restaurant that bears Daniel Bolud's last name and that, arguably, purports to reflect a more relaxed southern european quisine. Unfortunately, this review is not a reflection of the quisine, which was itself extraraordinary, but the absolutely sub-par service at one of the ""best"" restaurants north of west 60th street. I could, and should, be absolutely precise about what went wrong here, but if you are aiming to be a $100+ dollar restaurant then your service should justify the 200-300% margin that your kitchen and rent command. It did not. Some advice:1. Don't leave the first patron to be sat waiting for 15 minutes to receive his cocktail order while he awaits his guests;2. Do remind guests of the specials and why they should consider them with the meal (we were not inspired);3. Don't correct your patron on wine and offer an alternative that is inconsistent with the opening course (iberian ham and dry white?);4. Don't ignore your patrons when they are attempting to flag down someone to order (the sommelier had to take the order);5. Don't have your sommelier disappear when you are awaiting the main course and are ready to select a new wine (especially after the sommelier that took the order knows that the bottle of white does NOT go with anything that was ordered); 6. Don't disappear when the table is trying to order desert/clear the plates/get the check. None of these faux pas affect tip, its NYC and waiters are under-paid. That said, this kind of service gets in the way of enjoying the meal, especially when it is as extraordinary as it was tonight. The quality of the ingredients and the approachable creativity of Mediterranean lamb chops or pancetta wrapped quail stuffed with foie gras goes unnoticed if it arrives too quickly and without the opportunity to prepare for the next course. As horrible and cantankerous as it sounds, it is hard to focus on good food with the care and attention that it deserves if half of your mind is concerned with the wait staff and whether or not you will manage to get their attention in time. The truly insane thing about tonight is that wait staff actually missed out on opportunities to up-sell the guests on food and drinks by sheer virtue of timing. Service is supposed to worry about timing not the patron.",1,1,0,D. C.,"Key Biscayne, FL",0,1,0
3.0,8/20/2018,"Marked this place off my bucket list for New York City. So I was full of expectations when we went here. The food was great - some parts of it were excellent and some just OK. Stand-outs in the excellent category were the ACORN-FED IBÉRICO HAM ""CINCO JOTAS"" and the HOUSEMADE ""TARAMASALATA"". Really well made, perfect in every way. What disappointed was the CRISPY ZUCCHINI- fried zucchini strings... really?? The GAMBAS AL AJILLO was also memorable, the shrimp was perfectly cooked. What was the biggest let down was the service. Surprisingly. A couple of issues really should not have happened- the worst one was that they brought one of the entrees out with the appetizers - and were totally not bothered about it. In fact, they got annoyed when we asked them to take it away and bring it back with the rest of the entrees! Long story short- they did take it away and brought back the same plate- which was odd considering it was a fish entree, so of course - you see the problem. From a place like Boulud Sud, firstly I would not expect this kind of a mistake. Secondly, if it happens I expect them to be gracious about correcting it. Lastly - bring back a fresh plate - that was just totally unacceptable. At least I crossed it off my bucket list and did have some really good food.

5.0,6/29/2018,"Boulud Sud advertises its Mediterranean influences which are apparent and more importantly, authentic, boosting this place from 4 stars to 5. Its proximity to the Theater District leaves the restaurant with the obligation of dealing with time-anxious theatergoers which is not easy on any wait staff. Thankfully, we were not part of this rush, though I could see many were (and they all seemed pleased with service and cuisine alike). I hesitate to mention the hiccup in service because it was tended to so well and handled with great apologies. It took our server quite some time to acknowledge us, but once we requested the server next to us find our own, he addressed it immediately. Our server was apologetic and redeemed herself well with her attentive service thereafter. I was spoiled with a relaxing, well paced, well executed meal. The mezze was good; the babaganoush was clear star of the trio. Other standouts included the taramasalata with crispy chips for dipping, the exquisite roasted mushrooms, and the soupe de poisson. My entree consisted of a memorable white fish which I ironically cannot specify due to forgetfulness over black quinoa and some delicious puree. Overall, I would recommend Boulud Sud with those with the time to appreciate its excellence.",0,0,0,Jess S.,"Middletown, NJ",77,63,79
5.0,6/12/2018,"We were at Boulud Sud for lunch before a concert at nearby Lincoln Centre. This Mediterranean inspired restaurant was an oasis of calm during Saturday lunch hour with only a smattering of tables occupied.They were offering a two course lunch prix fixe at $28 and three courses for $34.First to arrive were their complimentary focaccia and olive bread, plus olive oil for dipping. This went down a treat. We then enjoyed a medley of flavours and textures from our Spring Vegetable Salad starters. Arugula, sliced fennel, sliced kale, frisée, shaved asparagus... with pecorino flakes and a creamy garlic accented dressing delighted our taste buds. The bouquet from the fresh greens was lovely, much like the spring breeze. Our main courses, Grilled Mediterranean Daurade (sea bream) were pan seared to perfection and then seasoned with simply a pinch of salt. They arrived sitting on a bed of sliced fennel with a scorched lemon wedge on the side and two accompanying sides to share-Patatas Bravas (crispy potatoes tapas style with garlic aioli) and Charred Broccoli Rabe (with pepperoncini and crispy shallots).The ambiance at Boulud Sud is elegant and sophisticated. The lunch specials offer great value. By employing quality ingredients and keeping to the authenticity of  flavours, its chefs have deftly captured the essence of Mediterranean cooking. Their attentive staff is the icing on the cake, making dining here a wonderful experience on all levels.We did not have anymore room for dessert after two courses.

3.0,6/10/2018,"Can't really decide how many stars this place deserves. Walking in feels a bit like being in someone's living room, more than a restaurant, despite the open kitchen and bustling servers. Maybe it's the carpeting? Our server was really sweet, patient about describing unknown ingredients, didn't pressure us to order more than we needed. But pacing for the meal was off. Starters and pasta courses arrived seconds apart, then there was a loooooong lag until main courses and an even longer lag to place our dessert order. Overall, food was pretty good, but not amazing. Portions were on the small side for the prices.- Greek salad ($18) had super tasty cubes of creamy feta, but the rest of it was forgettable- Grilled octopus ($25) was fine, but I've had bigger and better for this price- Squid ink pasta ($21 for small appetizer size) was not my style- Lemon linguini with seppia, boattarga, and a green called puntarella was better, but not a deal for $22.- Sea bass ($36) was a very thin fillet. Though I liked the crispy skin, the fish was cooked very, very well done.- Short ribs with mushrooms ($44) were tender, but a small portion- Side of asparagus ($9) was fine but a small side if meant to share with a table- Charred broccoli rabe ($9) was a more generous serving, but I just didn't love itWe tried two desserts- a strawberry panna cotta was a bit too sweet for me. The ""boulud sud mignardises"" was a sampler of baklava, chocolates, madeleines, turkish delight. it was fun to take a bite of each, but none left me wanting a second taste.Overall, it was fine and the rest of the fam seemed to really enjoy it.

Here are our contributing factors to selecting this restaurant: 1) brunch open on a Sunday2) easy reservations online3) world renowned chef4) easy reservations made a few days prior5) interesting looking menu - how often do you get to eat Mediterranean food?One appetizer I loved was the Taramasalata. It was basically a smoked cod roe dip with dill potato chips. The dip was smooth, creamy, and calming. It went great with their potato chips too (if you end up having more dip at the end, they ask if you want more potato chips too!). I got the 2 course brunch prix fixe for $28, not bad. I chose the Spring Onion & Potato soup, and the Seared Faroe Island Salmon. The soup was executed well, but I felt could be replicated at other restaurants. The salmon was cooked perfectly; still soft throughout, and the quality was amazing. This was actually a recommendation from our waitress, since I couldn't decide between the salmon and the Daurade. On another note, our service was very friendly and attentive too.The cocktails were also fantastic - loved the ""From the Field"" (Honey Comb, Lavender Infused Gin, Lemon). It was definitely worth the $17. This is also a great place to brunch if you have friends who are NOT adventurous in food. The brunch menu has lots of regular brunch menu options, like eggs benedict, french toast, ricotta pancakes, etc. This place was great for groups - it seemed like there were a lot of birthday celebrations here, and they have some private dining rooms on the floor below, another cool option.   Another interesting thing to note is that Daniel Boulud is famous for his French cuisine, not his Mediterranean cuisine.

4.0,4/10/2018,"I've lived on the Upper West Side for eight years now and have likely walked by Boulud Sud hundreds--if not thousands--of times. It's a wildly-trafficked venue. Not only is it one of the few, high-quality restaurants that sits directly on the UWS portion of Broadway, it's one of the few, high-quality, pre-theater options for Lincoln Center patrons. Add in the fact that it's a Daniel Boulud establishment and you've got yourself a solid recipe for longevity (long-standing businesses are closing left and right on Broadway these days, so that's saying something). It took me a while to bet to Boulud Sud, though, probably because I figured it was overhyped and overpriced. In cases like these, I'm happy to be proven wrong. It's not cheap, but I think the prices are warranted. Boulud Sud is a frighteningly well-oiled machine--meticulously managed for the clientele it attracts. The pacing is excellent and the food is superb. Unlike most restaurants in the Theater District, you're not ""settling"" by eating here. It's a fantastic experience, start to finish. Came here at 5:45pm on Saturday for a pre-theater dinner with the family and the bf. The atmosphere is refined and upscale, subdued decor but teeming with energy. It's a fairly large space, part of which looks into an open kitchen. When I said ""well-oiled machine"", I mean our table had a front row seat to some pretty spectacular choreography. Depending on the day and your reservation time, Boulud Sud offers a three-course, $65/pp prix fixe or an a la carte option. Because of our timing, we received the prix fixe menu, with a few daily specials offered for supplemental cost. You can still order some ""for the table"" bites in addition if you're looking to experience that part of the menu as well. For drinks, you really can't go wrong here. Solid cocktail menu, an oddly hidden yet exciting gin and tonic program, and an impressive wine list. I got to try three drinks, all of which were great. My sister and bf both got the From the Field (Honey Comb and Lavender Infused Gin, Lemon), which was perfectly balanced and delicious. They clearly know what they're doing with their gin. I ordered the Bouludsud Classique (Xoriguer Gin de Mahon, Housemade Tonic) from the G&T menu, which is made with an aged gin, tonic poured in at the table. Refreshing and yummy. For wine, I've been liking funkier styles lately, so I tried the Foradori, Manzoni Bianco, from Italy. A natural wine, recommended by one of the sommeliers and was exactly what I was looking for. Food-wise, everything we ordered was great. Nothing was outsanding enough for me to say it was a five-star experience, but it was pretty close. Yet another time I wish Yelp allowed half-star ratings. We mostly stuck with seafood, which tends to be my strategy at Mediterranean spots. Sophisticated palette, near-perfect execution all around, thoughtful and creative preparation and presentation. Though I tend to prefer a la carte to prix fixe, the bf and I split everything we ordered and the fam shared some table bites as well. All things considered, I'd say I got a good sampling of the menu. Our eats, below:Crudo Du Jour: AMan, I wish I could remember what exactly was in this. Beautiful and elegant, almost too pretty to eat but so delicious. Light and flavorful, all elements were clearly given a lot of thought. The main fish was fresh and tasty, as were the small pieces of additional fish used more as a garnish.Sicilian Sardine Escabeche w/ White Raisins, Toasted Pine Nuts: AMy family, though we have our quirks, is not one that's averse to sardines/anchovies. This had an Italian/Spanish flair to it too, and it was fabulous as a starter. Simple and light. Octopus A La Plancha w/ Marcona Almonds, Arugula, Jerez Vinegar: AMy favorite food, done right. I'm always extra critical of octopus because of how often I eat it. Cooked perfectly, tender and meaty, and served with accompaniments that worked beautifully to elevate the meat. Nice crunch from the almonds and bitterness from the arugula. Seared Mediterranean Sea Bass w/ Heirloom Carrots, Clementine, Saffron Fregola Sarda: A+Between the octopus and this stellar dish, Boulud Sud officially has my seal of approval for Mediterranean Restaurants that Do It the Right Way. Pristinely executed, great presentation, flavorful and well-balanced, all components fabulous and of course, the fish was excellent and cooked to perfectly. Grilled Lone Mountain American Wagyu Beef w/Braised Short Rib, Trumpet Mushrooms, Provençale ""Daube"": AI rarely eat red meat but I loved this dish as well. The bf insisted on ordering it as his main, and though I initially begrudgingly obliged, I was ultimately happy for the concession. Another the lovely presentation and display of great execution. Not sure if I liked the beef or the short rib more, but both were decadent and uber flavorful, enhanced beautifully by the sauce. *NOTE*: this does require a supplemental cost.",7,3,5,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480

2.0,4/4/2018,"First and foremost let me say that if I were rating on staff friendliness and food presentation alone I would give this restaurant 4.5 starts but sadly the food really fell short and thus such a low rating.  I was really disappointed and here is why:1. Appetizers:   They serve a complimentary cheese bread that had no flavor.  I highly suggest they heat it to bring out some of the flavors, but it was cold and tasteless.We order two platters with hummus, babaganoush, falafel and lavash bread. The hummus was too spicy, the felafel had a strange taste that I did not care for at all and the lavash was so overdone and hard (this bread needs to be warm and SOFT).  2. Dinners:  Presentations were lovely but that was the end of the ""good"" part.  My meal was several side dishes that were far too oily and tasteless - the vegetable dishes (asparagus and broccoli rabe were swimming in grease). I will say though that the mushrooms were wonderful with a variety of types that were not greasy.  I also had a salmon crudo that was nothing special at all - simply 4 pieces of salmon sashimi with little flavor (I've had far better). Fish dishes were dry (seabass and sole) and a pasta dish was nothing remarkable. (we all shared in each other's dishes).  3. Dessert: A chocolate dessert (pan con chocolate) that had the oddest flavor and just a tiny ""glob"" that looked like pudding.  I was so sad because the reviews here were pretty good and the owner of this restaurant is so well-known and respected.  We are quite the ""foodies"" (6 of us in our party) and all were disappointed.  Although KUDOs to our amazing waiter and kind staff.",0,0,0,Rita R.,"Lancaster, CA",2,39,0

First, they served a medley of dips (6 for just two of us) with some homemade potato and chickpea chips. So good, but easy to fill up on!Next, we had some sort of fish in a red (maybe red pepper based?) sauce served cold. Honestly, I thought it would be fishy but wasn't at all. One of my favs of the night!After that, we were served two pastas - the potato artichoke one (AMAZING) and a sea urchin one that was OK - especially compared to the first.Then, they brought out scallops over a dark rice followed by this amazing, citrusy duck. At this point, I was so full, I gave my bf half of my duck and regretted it in the morning (since it was so delicious)Before dessert, they gave us a palette cleanser that was a mini version of one of their popular grapefruit desserts.Dessert was 3 items - blood orange, this mini green brûlée roll and some sort of gelato.

4.0,3/12/2018,"Last night, w dined at Boulud Sud for an early Sunday night dinner, after seeing a play at Lincoln Center theater.  This is the 4th time we have dined there, in the last year.  Some of the recent reviews have been diners who were there for restaurant week.  As someone who has experienced many restaurant week dinners, I would like to suggest this isn't the best way to judge a restaurant (somewhat like basing a total review on a busy Saturday night, where the restaurant does one thing wrong, and the reviews are critical).If Yelp allowed a 4.5 star review, that would have been my selection.  This is a terrific restaurant, worth a trip from any part of the city or suburbs.  There are very few med dining options, so if you look this cuisine, be sure to dine here. If the portion size was a bit bigger, I would give this 5 stars.As others have mentioned, the bread is terrific.  This restaurant group has their own commissary, that bakes bread for all of their, very fine, restaurants. We started with the brussel sprouts, so delicious with an amazing tahini.  It makes the dish!  We had the sea bass as the main course.  Delicious.  Also, please keep in mind that NYC best restaurants have the best quality fish.  It's no small thing.  I like this room.  Spacious, comfortable, but not fancy.  The servers are professional, and know the menu very well.  We didn't have wine last night, but have done so at this restaurant, and there other restaurants.  It's a first class restaurant organization, and the wine selections are well considered, with people who can explain the wine to you, so you can make a good selection.

The restaurant itself was very large, and wasn't packed for brunch like it probably is for dinner. In terms of value, looking at the menu, the brunch is a better time to come than dinner. (Probably close to the same foods, too.)Everything has a Mediterranean flare, and the bread basket was delectable.

The entire staff was pleasant and welcoming- attentive throughout the meal. The food was lovely and unique. I started with the gambas which were lively and perfectly seasoned. My husband had the mezze platter and was kind enough to let me try his falafel. It was Amazing and not at all greasy, perfectly cooked. For mains I had the Greek Darude which was beautifully prepared with the skin on, grilled to perfection. The pepper sauce on top was truly stunning. My husband had the lamb cleopatra and raved about how flavorful and tender it was. However- all of the food I mentioned pales in comparison to my desert. I went with the grapefruit givre.

Everything we ate was delicious and the food came out surprisingly quickly as well. This place functions like a well oiled machine, it seems.I had the Restaurant Week menu:- Faroe Islands Salmon Crudo - Really great fish, clearly very high quality. Beautiful flavor with some nice microgreens on top.- Meditarrenean Mezze (from regular menu) - Best falafel I've ever had. Very crispy outside but not the least bit greasy, and very tender inside. I would love to know how they do this. It's kind of amazing. Also, the baba ghanoush and hummus are very flavorful.- Daurade (a fish) and potatoes - This comes with some kind of beautiful sauce that I couldn't identify but lapped up like a hungry dog. The potatoes really do steal the show, as the waiter said. They're baked and then fried and tossed with lemon, rosemary, parsley and thyme I believe. Delicious and crispy. The skin of the fish was cooked perfectly, nice and crisp the way I like it. Kudos for not removing the skin, as some restaurants do. You lose so much flavor and texture that way, I think.- Kataifi (a dessert, vaguely similar to bakhlava): Very tasty and decorated in a very cute way for my birthday, something I did not even ask for. How thoughtful! I think my wife's house made ice cream was even better though! She had the best chocolate ice cream ever, hands down. Also, there was a delcious pear ice cream with a really intense flavor. And there was also a vanilla ice cream that was so creamy you know it really is made in house.In sum, one heck of a meal.

3.0,11/20/2017,"I was expecting a lot more from a place that is so expensive. Came here for a dinner date. The service was slow even as the place was half full. Had to wave down a server on several occasions to ask for drinks and dessert. The food is good but not for the price and I didn't note anything extraordinary as part of the dinner menu. The one thing I will point out is the dessert, which was unique and an new experience for our palates. We ordered the GRAPEFRUIT GIVRÉ which was something I had never experienced. It is a half-emptied grapefruit filled with sorbet among other ingredients. The atmosphere was elegant and you should dress up if you go. Also ordered a cocktail (can't remember the name), which had a good presentation, it was prepared in a smoky glass, but that I didn't like enough to finish. Ordered instead the Hibiscus breeze which was alright but a little too sweet for my tastes; the CELERIADE was better.",0,0,0,Victoria T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",17,213,507
2.0,11/19/2017,"Nice ambience, awful, awful food.  Had a private dining experience.  Pretty room, good staff, didn't feel rushed.Appetizers, shrimp scampi - OK, but the shrimp are literally submerged in butter; mezze- good baba ganoush, homus a little spicy, falafel, well... not a fan generally, here I thought it had too many greens in it, but... others like it.The second, competent fish and absolutely disgusting lamb burger, completely, not even warm raw meat inside.  Out of about six of these ordered by our party, four were not eaten.  The kid had a beef burger and fries, wasn't nuts about either, competent without being anything special.Dessert fussy without being accomplished.  Chocolate cake with a crunchy part, a side part, this part, white part, that part, it didn't have good mouthfeel and didn't work together.  Candied fig, OK fig on a twisty pastry thing and some other round pastry things and well... absolutely nothing special.For my money, the worst Boulud meal experience I ever had, would have been better off going to Epicerie Boulud, well... the food would have been much better, but not the nice quiet room.Oh and let's not forget the ""polenta French fries"", it's polenta, deep fried!  Tastewise, take farina or similar hot cereal and deep fry it in a giant French fry shape!  Had enough left over on the plates of our party to build a Lincoln Log house, but... who would want to live in a house that reminds you of deep fried hot cereal?On balance, can't recommend it to anyone, there is a very good reason why you don't normally find raw lamb on the menu or breakfast cereal deep fried into amusing shapes.",0,0,0,telco h.,"Manhattan, NY",0,66,5

In fact, my friend and I frequent other Daniel Boulud restaurants with our husbands.  After this experience, we will never, ever return to this one.We were seated for a 7:15 pm reservation. A man took our drink orders. At 7:40 pm, a woman served our wine. I told her that we were ready to order, assuming she would get our waiter. Instead, she said that she could take our order. We ordered a small plate for the table, appetizers and two appetizer-sized pastas as entrees. The appetizers were served before the small plate. At 8:25 pm, with the small plate sitting on the table, our waitress was no where in sight and neither were our entrees. I found the manager and told him that we had to leave for the Film Festival at 8:45 pm. He assured us that our entrees would be right out. At 8:40 pm, still no entrees. Once again, I got up and found the manager. He magnanimously offered that we could come back after the film and have the entrees ""on us."" I snapped, ""I assume the entrees are on you anyway."" He also lamely offered that the waitress thought we were still working on our zucchini rings so she hadn't put in the order for our entrees. I told him this was ridiculous, as it was her job to ask us if we were through. And after and hour and a quarter, what did she expect? People around us who had come in after us were well into their entrees at that point.We asked for the check -- which they brought without taking anything other than the appetizer-sized pastas off the bill, no offer to have us in for coffee and dessert on them after the film, and no offer to otherwise make amends. Shocked but being more gracious than the restaurant, we paid. I have no doubt that had we not been two women but had been with our husbands, who would have stormed out without paying, they would not have dared to hand us a check.The entrees showed up until 8:50 pm.

The restaurant looks good; nice couches, comfortable chairs, pretty tables, good decor. But there's an open kitchen. So you walk in and you start smelling the smoke coming from all the cooking. I kept smelling it for about 10min after I sat down and then I got accustomed to it. Order: Appetiser - tuna Main - lamb Dessert - ice cream selection The tuna was quite bland. Which was funny because the couscous that was paired with the lamb was really salty. One issue with the ice cream was that it melted too quickly. It would be a good idea to keep it on a bed of ice or something. I couldn't eat it fast enough! The service was great! We had 3 different people come and ask us how our meal was.

3.0,8/2/2017,"Decided to try this nearby spot for restaurant week after reading some good reviews, but overall I'd say our experience was mixed. The service was spot on. Our server was helpful and answered all of our questions, and even let us move to a table by the window where there was a little more room, rather than sitting elbow-to-elbow with another party. As we looked over the menu, my friend wish that the lamb wasn't the only meat-centric dish on the entree portion; she ordered it anyway because she didn't want the fish (she was getting the tuna appetizer) and we had planned to share a pasta for an additional $15. The appetizer were really tasty. I think the tomato-watermelon gazpacho was my favorite dish of the whole night: light, refreshing, super flavorful. I loved the chunks of watermelon and tomatoes in it. The tuna was pretty good, too, and I enjoyed the avocado-based cream sauce that had been drizzled on top of it. My friend wasn't such a big fan of it, but she liked the tuna itself. Next up was the pasta. We'd chosen the ricotta gnocchi with corn and mushrooms, but unfortunately it seriously lacked flavor. The sauce was too mild, the mushrooms too small to really make an impact, and the gnocchi less fluffy and ricotta-tasting than we'd imagined they would be. We didn't really enjoy the pasta so much, but for $15 we kind of felt compelled to eat it all.We both got the lamb as our main entree. I really enjoyed the harissa spice crust and thought it was cooked perfectly. It really paired well with the couscous, tzatziki sauce, and eggplant, though I was left wishing the dish had included more of the eggplant rather than just one little sliver. For dessert, my friend chose the cannoli (she thought it would be the safe option) and I went with the ice cream trio after the server mentioned there would be a rose-flavored ice cream. The ""cannoli"" was a disappointment. It was deconstructed, and the only ""shell"" was a thin, fried crisp that kind of tasted like a wonton. I was unimpressed with the ricotta mousse; I think the cannoli cream I make at home tastes better, and I'd definitely hoped for more from such a big-name restaurant. The ice cream, on the other hand, was a hit. We enjoyed the subtlety of the rose flavor; the chocolate was dark and rich; and the fior di latte tasted like a milky, creamy vanilla.Overall I'd say we enjoyed our meal, but I can't say we'll be rushing to return anytime soon.",0,0,0,Chris D.,"East Bronx, NY",18,46,74
3.0,8/1/2017,"Came for restaurant week. While some things were spectacular, like the famed grapefruit halva, the squid ink bucatini, and complimentary bread and oil, there were some major short falls.The lamb was dry and chewy. And additionally, my father had at least 8 pieces where as I only had 4. It was a tiiiiny entree, and I really didn't appreciate the plating inconsistency. I asked for the lamb to be cooked medium rare, and it was not. It felt like the lamb had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. It arrived lukewarm and dry. The octopus (which requires a $7 supplement) was chewy and overcooked. The sauce was yummy though. Service was professional yet friendly.

Have been to Boulud Sud several times before and always enjoyed it very much but I ordered duck breast on this occasion and was very disappointed.

4.0,7/30/2017,"Went here with a friend after reading some favorable reviews of the place online and decided to check out their restaurant week menu. We each ordered different dishes so we could try out more dishes:Bread basket (4 stars): The bread and oil were pretty good and they were quick to bring out extra whenever it was low. White and brown bread were both tasty.AppsYellowfin tuna (4 stars): This dish was very refreshing and had a good combination of flavors. It was actually a decent size too, considering that similar appetizers are often on the smaller side.Gazpacho (4 stars): Another refreshing dish on a hot night and tons of flavor, with a nice textural component as well.EntreeCacio e pepe (4 stars): This dish was simple, but done very well--pasta was well-cooked and flavorful.Lamb (3.5 stars): I have to say that I was slightly disappointed by this dish as I was expecting the lamb to be a little more flavorful. I was shocked to have this be the least exciting item of the meal.DessertCalisson D'aix (4 stars): This dessert was very unique and had a lot of great flavors. The ""cake"" part of the dish was a little underwhelming, but everything else was on point.Ice cream trio (4 stars): Rose ice cream, lemon coconut, and chocolate coffee (or something like that). They were all interesting and decent--nothing mind-blowing, but good.Overall, this place serves up some great food and has a nice energy to it. Other than the service being a little bit spotty at times, this place has a good thing going and I am excited to try out some of Boulud's other restaurants around the city.",2,2,1,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225

5.0,7/25/2017,"This place is exceptional. I went with a friend for their restaurant week dinner special. With tax and tip, we each spent $60 for a three course meal. I had the gazpacho as my first course. It's a cold, tomato based soup which they flavored with watermelon and deliciousness.For my second and main course, I had the dorade fish. It's a small Mediterranean fish with big taste! it was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. It was accompanied with a few pieces of grilled veggies and an eggplant sauce.For the third course, I chose the grapefruit sorbet with halva which came inside a frozen half grapefruit. It was a $5 supplement to the menu but worth every penny. This dessert was light, summery and tasty.The service was attentive, polite and very responsive. Our waitress was particularly great with the course timing. Our busboy was very kind and courtesy; he waited to place bread on the table until we stopped conversation so as not to interrupt. Our water was continuously refilled without having to ask. The bread was brought warm and fresh multiple times.Overall, this place is really a great restaurant especially if you're going to see a performance at Lincoln Center to follow. They are respectful of your timing and will hurry up or slow down depending on your needs. The tables are nicely spaced apart so that you don't feel like you are sitting on top of others. Outside of restaurant week, the prices are on the higher end.

4.0,7/25/2017,"What better way to kick off restaurant week than at Boulud Sud! First off special shoutout to their complimentary fresh baked breads. I can make a meal out of those alone! From their restaurant week menu I chose the yellowfin tuna for my appetizer. It was super fresh and I loved the drizzling of avocado sauce and crispy onions on top. Keeping with the fish theme I got the Dorade for my main and it was a lovely fillet, perfectly seasoned with crispy skin. The vegetable side with roasted pepper sauce was a perfect accompaniment for this light and delicate fish. To top it off I ordered their famous Grapefruit Givre and it did not disappoint! The dessert felt decadent but wasn't overly sweet. I loved the layer theme, like peeling a fresh grapefruit but better. The top layer of Halva was light and fluffy, the brulee was perfect. Underneath was a layer of whipped cream and mixed in were rose flavored turkish delights. Finally the grapefruit sorbet was tasty and refreshing in its shell of frozen hallowed out grapefruit. All parts assembled this was a perfect summer meal!Service here was top notch! Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. I told her that we were a little pressed for time and had to make it to a show downtown and she had the kitchen time our food perfectly. We had a 5:15 reservation and she had us out by 7 pm on the dot.

4.0,7/24/2017,I love bar boulod so assumed would like this especially after seeing the restaurant week menu. This review will be nit picky but get that way for over 30 dollar entree place.First bad thing was the foie gras and chicken liver mouse was removed from menu. Place is gorgeous as most glass frontage of almost any place in the city.The anchovies were good but a bit salty and would be better done in vinegar.  My tuna crudo was good but not great.The salmon was replaced by dourada and was nice and flaky and not overpowered by sauce.  The tagine was cooked separately as did not have the falloff the bone saturated in taste that is expected.  Cous cous was an after thought for the same reason as no chicken flavor.  Liked the cheese course and could have filled up on the focaccia bread.Wine list was good as had the fan favorite au bon climat chard.Usually like attentive service but not when they are trying to take away plates all the time even if obviously still have food.  Never even put silver ware in way to signal wanted it taken  awayWill return to bar boulod but not here.,0,0,1,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",179,395,788

Truly amazing service!!The food, however, left much to be desired. At these prices, and in NYC where there are so many great restaurants, AND with the Daniel Boulud name, you would expect better tasting food. Each dish of the 2 appetizers, 2 main courses that we tried had something missing. The gnocchi wasn't very flavorful, and the corn seemed to be an odd addition to the pasta. The burrata, at a $7 supplement, didn't taste like the high-quality burrata offered at other establishments. The sea bass was tasty, though its strange that the seasoning was done on top of the scales--do most people eat the scales of the fish? By taking off the scales, the fish was left without any seasoning, except lots of salt on the actual fish itself.On a positive note, the grapefruit dessert and the chocolate dessert were good!I also agree with other reviewers that at a restaurant of this caliber, paper tablecloths should not be part of the table decor.",0,0,0,Gina M.,"New York, NY",79,191,44

2.0,6/13/2017,"What happened??? Something has drastically changed at both the Bouluds by Lincoln Center, for the worse.Having frequented Boulud Sud since it first opened, I was very disappointed with my most recent visit two weeks ago. Sat at the bar, which had plenty of open spaces, but for some reason it took a while to get menus and have our order taken. Ordered my usual cocktail. It arrived way too sweet. I asked for it to be adjusted, at which point the bartender brought over his squirt bottle of lemon juice and squirted some into my glass. Are you kidding? I figured a glass of wine was safer at this point.Noticed that their mushroom farrotto side had been replaced by a pesto version, so I asked about it. Bartender said oh it still has mushrooms, and some pesto added. Ordered the chicken tagine, and the farrotto on the side. The tagine, which I have had many times before, was extremely salty. The farrotto was overlooked, and no, there were no mushrooms. I had requested msemen (their delicious flatbread) when the bread was served, and was told it would come out when it was ready. It never came.All in all, a terribly disappointing meal from a past neighborhood favorite. Echoed by Bar Boulud a week later.

2.0,6/12/2017,"This is a review not for Boulud Sud's food, which is quite good.  Rather, this is a review of Boulud Sud's service, which is the worst for its price point of any restaurant that immediately comes to mind.  But that's not the greatest offense - everyone makes errors (though certainly not as many as were made in our most recent, and final, visit).  The serious failing of this establishment is the arrogance and apathy that characterized their response to those errors.Certainly, one would never expect at a restaurant of this caliber for the first course to arrive before the first round of drinks.  And certainly, one would never expect the first round of drinks, having arrived so late, to be served in dirty glasses.  If either of these things happened, one might expect a profuse apology -- for both the grave error in service and in execution.  Here, we received neither.  And rather than have the staff redouble its efforts to ensure that the service issues were rectified going forward, the staff appeared to go out of its way, until the very end of meal, to deliberately ignore us.  Sure enough, it took five minutes to get anyone's attention to order our next round of drinks, only for it to take another ten minutes for that next round to arrive (leaving us without drinks at the start of my second course, as well).At certain restaurants, I might not be surprised or overly disappointed by these issues, but not here.  This is not fine dining in New York.  This is an overpriced, overrated restaurant strategically positioned to cater to a pre-theater crowd of out-of-towners.  No self-respecting New Yorker should set foot in here.  The food is good, but not nearly enough so to make up for such an expensive, aggravating dining experience.",5,0,0,Noah X.,"New York, NY",0,27,0

5.0,4/23/2017,"On paper, Boulud Sud probably wouldn't appeal to me as much as its neighbor in the Boulud empire - in fact, we once traded reservations with a group of ladies for whom Bar Boulud was their second choice (and Boulud Sud was ours).  Peering in the admittedly nifty door has always led me feeling a little underwhelmed by the decor (which is pretty understated in comparison to Bar Boulud), and a little anxious about the crowds.  In hindsight, it's crowded out the vestibule (out the door) because the food is really compelling. My knock on the decor is probably short-sighted anyway - once you're at your table, you'll feel a sort of understated luxury.  Not flashy, but definitely luxe.  Our server was exceptionally charming, led us to many tasty items on the menu, and gave excellent counsel.  We probably ordered more than we should have, but, then again, I don't recall any leftovers...The food! We shared the mezze which sounds a little de rigueur on the menu, but when it arrives the Mediterranean specialties, filtered through the Boulud prisim, are absolutely fantastic.  Ditto the taramasalata with the most insanely addictive dill potato chips I've ever had (our server offered us more, which we greedily downed post haste).  The Arabic lamb flatbread was seat-clutchingly delicious, delectably spiced, yet full of nuance.  My wife had spaghetti with bottarga, which was a perfectly-distilled briny essence of the sea, in noodle form.  A friend had scallops with various accompaniments (including pistachios and blood oranges), and I had grilled Mediterranean sea bass with fregola.  The flavor combinations were inspired, the execution was perfect.  My companions shared mignardises, including orange blossom Turkish delight, baklava, and more.  I had the infamous (justly so) grapefruit givré, which was a hollowed out grapefruit with grapefruit sorbet, halva, and rose loukoum which was for all the world like rose cotton candy.  I was prepared to order a Finger Lakes cider with the givré, and the sommelier gently suggested an alternative, some Chartreuse.  I'm glad he did, the combination was out of this world, and much better than the cider would have been.  I'm nuts for floral elements in cocktails, and, given the Mediterranean bearing of the place, the cocktails did not disappoint.  Honestly, mixology has always been a stealthy strong suit of the Boulud empire.  Next time, we'll see what kind of wine they pair with the food, and how they handle the interesting spicing.  Like Bar Boulud, Boulud Sud is tailored, by design, to marry well with an evening at Lincoln Center, with lots of options for pre- and post-theatre treats.  I'm honestly going to have a hard time deciding which to pick for our next outing in the neighborhood.",0,0,2,David R.,"Bethlehem, PA",1,32,163

Apparently as the casual version of Daniel, Boulud Sud carried a much more down-to-earth environment, with a bit of ""something else"".We decided to go with the two course prix fixe, as it seemed to be a set with good value. Felt to me, my main dish green shakshouka was a bit on the greasy side, so I could hardly detect the green sauce flavor. Still recommend Jack's Wife Freda for green shakshouka.We shared the warm pistachio dessert, with blood orange and rose sorbet sitting on the side quietly. This was my favorite dish of the day! - well sweetened, a light nutty scent, and the fruit only made it more refreshing. The rose ice cream was just an extra highlight, paired itself well with those warm pieces. Well done!Probably I should not be asking for too much considering the fact that UWS historically was just a dead zone for dining options, and indeed Boulud Sud did a better-than-average job in both food presentation and taste.

Appetizers, We ordered a Potato & Sunchoke soup,  a Salmon Crudo,  a Gamba al Ajillo (Ruby Red Shrimp), and Octopus a la plancha.  The soup was smooth and light.  But the most impressed one was the octopus. The Ruby Red Shrimp was just regular shrimp but fresh though, comes with few pieces of breads which were also one type of the complementary breads. Entree. We had a Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass (It was brilliant and cooked just perfect.  The presentation was beautiful and the fregola sarda underneath the fish was cooked al dente),  a Moroccan Chicken Targine(It was way too salty.  At the beginning,  we didn't realized, however,  when we almost finished the dish,  maybe the couscous underneath soaked completely the sauce which made the whole dish salty.  (PS: We were dehydrated after dinner so you can tell how salty it was.)),  Ricotta Cavatelli with Black Truffle, and Harissa Grilled Leg of Lamb.As for dessert,  we had the signature,  Grapefruit Givre, Warm Pistachio M'Hanncha, and a Chocolate Tiramisu Gateau. The Pistachio was good but a little bit too sweet. It could be made lighter.  However,  both Grapefruit Givre and the Tiramisu were really good.  Every bite we had for the Grapefruit Givre was surprise,  I loved the Rose Loukoum in the sorbet since it was chewy and gave some texture to the whole dessert. I can imagine how refreshing and light when we have it during summer.  (MUST TRY). Overall,  we enjoyed the dinner but no matter the quality of food and the server could be better. However,  I may still recommend Boulud Sud to my friends having them to try the Grapefruit Givre.",1,0,0,Vivian N.,"New York, NY",1,19,275

We came to celebrate a special birthday and the service and experience was really lackluster and poor quality, particularly when one considers the cost of the meal. It took more than 30 minutes before we could order a drink. Our reservation was at 5;30 but we only got our mains at 7:30!

5.0,2/2/2017,"I don't love writing reviews after only one dining experience, but, I do it anyway:My girlfriend and I came during restaurant week.  We had arrived on time for our 8:30 reservation, but were not seated until 8:55.  While I was a little hangry by the time we were seated, I realize that these things happen - especially during restaurant week.While the waitress probably did not know how long we waited for the table, she certainly made up for it in service.  When I was having trouble choosing wine, she consulted with the bartender and volunteered samples for me to choose from.  My girlfriend - who has a gluten allergy - received gluten free crisps alongside the bread that was served.  When she asked which desserts were gluten free, the waitress said, ""Dessert is very important - let me check with the kitchen"" and later informed us that the kitchen was going to modify their grapefruit & halva dessert to accommodate her allergy. It was not just a matter of leaving out some breadcrumbs.  They served an entirely different presentation just for her.The portions were generous, beautifully presented, and delicious.  We had octopus and cavatelli as appetizers, and leg of lamb and tagine as entrees.  I would happily eat any of those dishes again, although I would more likely try different items on the menu which looked equally delicious on other guests tables.  The side of broccoli rabe was an unexpectedly generous portion and very tasty, but could have used way less oil.  Some of us old folks still think that vegetables are supposed to be good for you...While the cost of this dinner was a steal during restaurant week, the prices on their a la carte menu are reasonable.  We will eat here again and we feel fortunate to have sampled this place with a prix fixe menu.",0,0,0,Smith Z.,"New York, NY",0,40,0
2.0,2/1/2017,"My whole experience with Boulud Sud was just awkward from start to finish.  About 2 weeks ago, I made an online reservation for dinner this past Saturday for a party of 5 - we were all heading to Lincoln Center afterwards and it also happened to be my 30th birthday.  I was thrilled to try Boulud Sud and even more so because of the seemingly great $60 pre-theatre prix fixe menu.  A week before our reservation I received a vague voicemail from the hostess at Boulud Sud instructing me to call the restaurant so that I could provide them with my email address so that they could send me the terms and conditions applicable to large groups.  I would then have to reply to that email indicating my written acceptance to the terms.  This was peculiar because I had already provided my credit card information as a guaranty when I booked the reservation online and we were a group of 5 (didn't realize 5 constituted a ""large group"").  I called the restaurant back within 24 hours and the hostess assured me she would send the aforementioned email, but that email never arrived.  I called the restaurant again 3 days before our reservation and spoke to a different hostess who then resent the email, which I finally received.  In my opinion, a lot of effort just to confirm a reservation.Once we were seated for our reservation, we were presented with menus with no explanation and had to wait approximately 30 minutes before we even spoke to our waiter (after we had to ask the hostess twice to send our waiter to our table).  2 of 5 in our party received drinks immediately when the remaining 3 had to wait another 30 minutes before they were able to order a bottle of wine with the sommelier.  When it was time to order we inquired about the advertised pre-theatre prix fixe menu and without any further explanation our waiter responded, ""we normally have a pre-theatre prix fixe menu...but not tonight"".  When I first called to confirm our reservation the hostess explicitly told me that this menu would be an option for our group - we had no prior notice of Saturday being an exception and no explanation or apology was offered.  We sat down for our reservation at 5:45PM and our main courses arrived 1.5 hours later at approximately 7:15PM.  Shortly after receiving our main courses our waiter presented us with our check because ""he knew that we had an 8PM show and wanted to keep us on time"".  We were planning to order dessert, but at this point the foyer was getting packed with the wave of post-theatre patrons and we felt like we were being rushed out.  We paid (the very pricey) check and left feeling pretty disappointed with the whole experience.I have to say that, in full disclosure, the food was excellent.  This restaurant has the potential to be a wonderful place but it really needs to improve some of its practices and pay more attention to the quality of its service.  I understand that it can be challenging catering to the pre-theater and post-theatre crowds (sometimes simultaneously) but the level of service we experienced was not worth the high price we paid for our dinner.",1,0,0,Marc R.,"New York, NY",87,3,0
4.0,1/31/2017,"I tried out the winter restaurant week dinner prix fixe with my girlfriend. The restaurant has somewhat of a classic/art-deco feel to it, which is not usually my favorite aesthetic, and I'm not sure how it was envisioned to go with this style of cuisine, but it was fine and comfortable and very spacious, which is a rarity in this city. Our server (Ciara, I believe) was very sweet and professional, and the other waitstaff came regularly to fill up water, remove crumbs from the table, etc.My date's appetizer was a sashimi dish, which was too salty but otherwise good (beautiful presentation), and mine was a potato soup, which was tasty, but there was nothing extraordinary about it.Our main courses were lamb and chicken tagine. Both were quite delicious. The aromas from the chicken were enveloping, and the plating was quite nice. Flavors were excellent, but not mind-blowing as they are in some higher end restaurants. For instance, Daniel was an unparalleled experience; Boulud Sud was a great one.Desserts were beautiful and tasty. One was a frozen grapefruit dish with beautiful presentation, but frankly, not my favorite (my date loved it though) and the other was a pistachio pastry with gelato (this, I quite enjoyed).  Our server also brought us an extra mediterranean dessert plate including Turkish delights, chocolate truffles, baklava, and other small items, which was a wonderful gesture and thoroughly appreciated.I would come here again during another promotional period or if a dish appears on the menu that looks amazing, but I would not go here regularly. Still, I do recommend trying it at least once and forming your own opinion.

I'd been meaning to come here and when I saw that it was featured on restaurant week, it was an offer too good to resist!The waitstaff is nice and knowledgeable about the food and wine. Only thing to note was that after I turned down the cocktail list, saying I would get the $9 Restaurant Week wine instead, the waitress tried to push the $15-18 glasses of wine off the wine list instead (-1*). I declined, saying I would stick with the Restaurant Week wine, and she didn't push it any further.  For the record, the Restaurant Week special wine was delicious!Delicious food, got the beet radicchio for the appetizer, the lamb tabouleh for entrée, and the $5 upcharged  frozen grapefruit dessert. All of them were delicious, and very well-made. The presentation was also gorgeous. The waiter (my initial waitress went off duty and switched with him midway through the meal) mentioned that the grapefruit dessert is something that some of their patrons come in specifically to order. It was cool, it was a frozen grapefruit with jellies inside, topped with a sweet fuzzy substance that resembled cotton candy twisted. One thing to note for those with sensitive teeth-- it's Very cold. Perhaps wait a few seconds or minutes to wait for it to become slightly less frozen. The decor in the place is large and spacious, with open-air feel to it. The kitchen allows a peek into it, where you can glance over and see the magic being made.The bathrooms downstairs also service Bar Boulud, their sister restaurant around the corner.

The swordfish was nicely cooked, still juicy, however there wasn't much seasoning and the whole dish just wasn't that memorable. Dessert was a let down! I ordered the apple tart that was supposed to come with pistachio ice cream. When the dish came, the ice cream was clearly vanilla and not pistachio so I brought it to the waitress' attention.

2.0,11/27/2016,"As a NYer, Ive had the opportunity to dine at Boulud Sud on a few occasions and Daniel. If not for the Manager and Bartender I would drop my rating. Came in last night with my Mum and Aunt. Because we arrived before dinner, the bar menu was the only option available to us. Instead of informing us of the menu options, the hostess made it a point to note the price difference which was insulting since we didnt walk in looking for a $5 burger. We sat at the bar and specifically asked the hostess for availability of a table if it opened up. My mother at one point walked over to her to restate this request but somehow the hostess forgot when two tables freed up. We then asked the manager for assistance who accommodated us. I had informed the waiter that I have a nut allergy which I restated when ordering dessert and yet I still received a cheese platter with walnuts. So again, although the manager was very helpful I think the service could be improved. In general, something like a nut allergy should be given priority and the hostess could have been hospitable. I've been at Momofuku on a Friday night where they didnt take reservations but the hostess went out of her way to find me and propose an open table to make us comfortable.

1.0,11/26/2016,"I am not one to write reviews typically, but this experience calls for a word of warning to all who are considering dining at Boulud Sud - keep an eye on your food, it might scurry off the plate. My wife and I were dining at Boulud Sud and having a nice time - good cocktails, fun table shares - when right after our appetizers were cleared we noticed a LARGE COCKROACH had decided to pull up a seat and feast on my wife's bread plate. I kid you not.She of course screamed. People looked at us like we were crazy (until they too observed the situation). I was shocked and thought it was a joke. Just take a look at the photo - it speaks a thousands words.I don't need to get into it and shame individuals, but the restaurant's response was less than stellar and involved the roach scurrying off the plate, onto the manager and then darting between tables to destination unknown. And then a begging ""please don't leave"" as we promptly lost our appetite.In all my years in NYC, dining at many of the top restaurants in the city, I have never experienced something as grotesque at this. I mean, maybe if I was at a Chinese/Mexican restaurant where you order by pointing to the picture, I could understand this. But Boulud Sud? From the venerable Daniel Boulud? Where entrees are at least $30 and drinks are $20?  How could it be?My wife was already extremely cautious of restaurant grades and food safety to the point of paranoia. This certainly won't help me persuade her to try the new place down the block that sadly got a ""B.""

This food does. Its all great at the same time as being innovative. Customer service is 4.8 stars too. Everyone who worked there - even people we never interacted with directly - smiled, wished us a good evening, and were helpful. The only slight negative was that the waitress didn't explain any of the dishes at all. And when we mentioned we were going to the concert after dinner, she refused to take our appetizer order to get the ball rolling until we ordered everything including main dishes and desserts. But everyone else was great - even the guy who took our plates, and waiters we passed on the way out the door. It was amazing.The only slight negatives were that the tables were crowded fairly close together where we were almost sharing the meal with the table on our left and our right. And the place is a bit noisy. 85% of the dishes were great and amazing. Also price for two (2 x fixed price of $60 plus one glass of $11 wine each ended up at $185 with tip). Individual Items :Bread : Two slices of a slightly greasy focaccia that we didn't like, and a very good rosemary herb fresh that was fresh and moist. We asked for some balsamic vinegar and oil and they happily complied, but the balsamic tasted slightly cheap/sour. They were extremely generous in bringing more of the rosemary bread. Mezze Appetizer : felafel with herbs (perhaps mint) was amazing! The hummus was good. The babaganoush we didn't care for. It was served with chips, but we would have preferred something more like bread or pita rather than hard spiced chips.Tomato Penne Appetizer : A very tasty dish. Hard to identify the exact seasoning but it was interesting and tasty. the penne was slightly al dente. the tomato was cut into fairly small pieces which I liked.the sea bass with fig : the sea bass was very good, but the pilaf of rice, grains and slivered almond was the best part. Again there were some hard-to-pinpoint seasoning but it was great. the chicken tanginess had mainly white meat, with a rich aromatic sauce, with couscous, and some various olive, tomato, carrot and apricot. The flavoring was amazing and we used it as a dipping sauce for the meat. The meat was slightly dry though which is surprising for tangible cooking.

We had never encountered anything like this before.  It was quite off-putting.Now for the ambience:  The dining room and bar area have all the charm of a lounge area at JFK airport!  From the dull curtains, to the grey airport carpet, to the grey chairs, lighting, ceiling space, etc. It brought us back to the era of TWA and Pan Am business lounges.The atmosphere was louder and more frenetic than we like.  And it should be noted that most of the diners were Seniors- with that certain Upper West Side cultured vibe.The food:  Overall we would rate the food a  C+/B-. The bread was cold and nothing special at all. Dipped in olive oil didn't help to make it taste any better. The gazpacho soup tasted more like tomato paste than gazpacho and there was no hint of the watermelon that was described in the menu.   The ouzo marinated salmon sounded better than it tasted. No ouzo taste or aroma was evident; instead the dill yogurt was too dominant.  We both chose the main dish of the slow-baked merlu with tabouleh. This was just OK, slightly undercooked, and frankly quite boring.   Finally, we both had 3 scoops of ice cream for dessert.The only good thing about our meal was the waitress, who was lovely and attentive.Oh how we wish that we had chosen a different restaurant for one of the last few nights of restaurant week.",4,0,0,Rima F.,"New York, NY",181,439,14

4.0,8/14/2016,"This is a Restaurant Week Summer 2016 review.I came here after work with a couple of friends.  We had a couple drinks at the bar, since we arrived a bit early - drinks are well-made but can take a while. The bartenders are very helpful and polite, though.Along with the complementary bread and olive oil (very nice), for appetizers, we ordered had:Octopus A La Plancha ($8 supp) - Marcona Almonds, Arugula, Jerez Vinegar; loved them! very nicely cooked, not overdone (which can be the worst). Worth the supplement.Gambas Al Ajillo ($5) - Ruby Red Shrimp, Spanish Chili, Focaccia: delicious!Citrus Marinated Scottish Salmon - Charred Scallion Aïoli, Shaved Fennel, Garlic Chips - being a huge fan of nova/lox/smoked salmon...this was good stuff.For our mains, we order:Hand-Made Ricotta Ravioli AP - didn't happen to try this, but my friend didn't leave any on his plate.Harissa Grilled Leg of Lamb (Toasted Couscous, Tunisian Eggplant, Tzatziki) - oh man, fantastic! Very...very pleased. Perfectly cooked, went great wit the tzatziki...just great.And the desserts:Dark Chocolate Biscotti (Manjari Crémeux, Almond, Pistachio-Black Cherry Gelato) - decadent but just so good. The dark chocolate paired really well with the pistachio gelato. winner.Peach and Nectarine Crostata (Brown Sugar Sablé, Blueberry, Lemon Verbena Sorbet) - a light, but tasty dessert which complemented the bounty of food already consumed nicely.Tiramisu Cube ($5 supp) - Mascarpone Mousse, Kahlua Ganache, Coffee Gelato: It was really nice, and went well with the coffee gelato...but not convinced it was worth the supplement.Either way, this was definite a Restaurant Week victory, and would definitely go back.",2,0,0,Steve L.,"New York, NY",157,309,1204
4.0,8/12/2016,"I was really torn between a 3- and 4-star rating for this restaurant.I came here with my friends to try their Restaurant Week Lunch Menu and unfortunately, two of our guests were late... Thankfully, the hostess was understanding and allowed us to sit while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Strangely, the kitchen closes the same time the restaurant closes. Working in the restaurant industry, I understand the frustration for customers to arrive close to last seating but things happen and you're not supposed to show your annoyance!!! Our impatient server clearly didn't give a crap as he rushed us to order and everything on his face screamed ""Can you hurry up already?"" Everyone else seemed nice enough so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he was just having a bad day. For starters, I had the Octopus A La Plancha ($10 Supplement). While it was tasty, I wasn't  sure if it was worth the $10 supplement. The portion was kind of small. The same goes for the Gambas Al Ajillo, the Ruby Red Shrimp. Again, the portion was small but the $5 supplement was at least tolerable. If you're into garlic and spices, the shrimp appetizer is definitely the dish for you. My friend loved it so much, he saved the remaining sauce for more bread. If you're not keen on paying more than you already have to, my other friends tried the Traditional Fattoush Salad and they loved it! For the entree, I had the Seared Local Albacore Tuna... I'm not sure what to make of it but it wasn't bad. You HAVE to eat it WITH the hummus or whatever it was that came with it. My friends got the Chicken Tagine ($7 Supplement) and Harris Grilled Lamb Burger. The chicken was super tender but it was heavy with spices -- very tasty though. I never tried the lamb burger (I don't eat lamb) but I had one of his Polenta fries and it was so good! I wonder if we could've ordered it as a side dish...Last but not least, for dessert, I had the Dark Chocolate Biscotti. SUPER SWEET! NOT A FAN. Nonetheless, I was super pleased with the many options Boulud Sud had to offer. I would definitely come back because I'm under the impression that their food grows on you... It certainly did for me!

Collectively, we ordered the salmon appetizer, the tuna and lamb entrees, and the chocolate and peach desserts. Everything was amazing - I especially liked the flavours in the salmon carpaccio. There was something in the tuna that kind of tasted like spicy mayo, which was a little strange given that this is a pretty high end feel restaurant, but I enjoyed it nonetheless! Service was great. At the end they let us sit there for a pretty absurdly long time without rushing us with the bill, which was nice. I had a great time!",1,0,0,Sophie Y.,"Providence, RI",418,40,6
3.0,8/5/2016,"Restaurant week, summer 2016, lunch on a Friday.Service: There was one waiter who spoke some pretty awesome Mandarin, good for him. All our servers were polite and attentive. Only complaint is that they seemed overeager to take our plates. I eat slowly and like to put my knife and fork down between mouthfuls, and we were asked if we were done at least ten times throughout the meal, sometimes disrupting the flow of our evidently engaging conversation.Decor: No complaints - soft and comfortable. The ceilings are really interesting and give the illusion of being mirrored surfaces.Ambience: Pleasantly quiet diners. Some power lunchers, some leisure lunchers, one group of new mothers, one group of salmon shorts hipsters. They played some kind of music that sounded like the Jeopardy theme. Menu: There were some additional items for restaurant week that weren't on the online version of the menu, but all of these had a supplementary charge.Food: My usual diet is relatively simple, so my overall impression is biased towards the food being a bit too heavy on flavor and heartiness. I left feeling like I didn't want to eat again for at least two days.Bread and olive oil: Fresh and delicious. Herb one was pillowy soft, olive one was chewy and robust. Get seat near window with the burlap-like curtains for the full artisanal experience.Chilled tomato gazpacho: Sublime. Like a cocktail sauce with party favors.Citrus marinated Scottish salmon: Beautifully paper-thin radish. Garnish of dill was divine and an appropriate choice as it awakened my senses for the fish. The salmon was thick and fresh, but I feel that the dish was needlessly overdressed. A little on the salty side, and the aioli was much too heavy. First bite was a cool zesty punch of various flavors, but towards the end, I just wanted to taste the simple flavor of salmon cured in citrus without the thirst-inducing slathering of salty whip.Harissa grilled lamb burger: Amazing. Lamb was so flavorful and juicy. I feel this was also needlessly overaccompanied. Probably didn't need the saganaki.Seared local albacore tuna: Dining partner wasn't impressed, said the tuna tasted old. To me it tasted plain and tuna-like, which I appreciated. The quinoa tabouleh was delightfully light, flavorful, and complex and was my favorite part of the dish. Appreciated the bonus thrill of a shishito pepper, the Russian Roulette of the Capsicum Casino. I got lucky.Crushed potatoes in olive oil: We got this in addition, it is not from the restaurant week menu. Simple, delicious, rich, buttery. I cleaned the plate.Peach and nectarine crostada: Most american desserts are way too sweet for me, and this was only a little too sweet. The fruits tasted fresh but not farmers market flavor explosion fresh. Pastry was very good. Lemon gelato was crisp and tangy. My partner demolished it.Dark chocolate biscotti: Divine. My first bite was of the pistachio black cherry gelato. Oh my goodness. This was a great composition - I tried various combinations of the various ingredients, and every mouthful was uniquely sensational.",2,0,0,Delia W.,"New York, NY",0,5,10

2.0,7/9/2016,"My fiancé and I live in the Lincoln center neighborhood and were excited to try this restaurant for the first time. We started with the Greek salad and ordered the fish special which was branzino for $55.00. We asked if this was to share which the server confirmed it was for 2 and came with 1 side. The food was delicious and we were excited to put this restaurant into our rotation... Until we got the bill. We were charged $110 for the fish we shared (1 side). We spoke with the manager about the confusion based on what we were told by the server (never was told it was $55.00 per person) who was completely unhelpful & acted as if the miscommunication was on our end. While he did take off the $15 appetizer he did nothing to adjust the entree. Overall, the food was really great but after feeling totally scammed, we will never be returning here. There are plenty of other great (honest) restaurants in this area.",0,0,0,Sara M.,"New York, NY",0,5,1
3.0,7/1/2016,"I went to Boulud Sud with my boyfriend last night and had to wait 15 min for a table. Not bad given that it was a Thursday and we had no reservations.The service was okay though nothing on the menu was explained very clearly. The ambiance was nice since the weather was beautiful and we were outside. There was a guy playing the guitar quietly as we dined; I wished he had stuck around until the end so I could give him a well-deserved tip. We first ordered a trio of dips: hummus, babaganoush and taramasalta. The dips were yummy but was disappointed by the herbed falafel which had way too much salty seasoning on them. I would have prefered pita or a different type of bread. Next, we had the crispy artichokes alla romana which was fried and served on a thick mayo-like dressing. I could barely taste the artichoke and again was disappointed by the seasoning. The Israeli-spiced chicken wings were so salty that I could not finish them and were also very tiny - not much meat there. My boyfriend's fish was also tiny but at least tasted good and had a nice crisp skin (which is the reason that I'm giving 3 stars and not 2).

As mentioned above, we received dishes that were too salty. This was fixed. But the tajine (MOROCCAN CHICKEN TAGINE - Turnips, Moroccan Couscous, Preserved Lemon), a very traditional dish, missed the mark. The flavors weren't there.

The ravioli was missing the addition of a binder and pop like goat milk ricotta with fresh herbs - that would have done wonders for it. The Moroccan chicken was good, I would've liked golden raisins in the couscous to break up the strong taste of cardamon and the saltiness. As for the crispy potatoes side it was barely edible :-( Like eating a crunchy salt chip. For the record, I like salt but someone in the kitchen that night was going overboard.All of the dishes are fairly good, but all seem to be missing balance so after a few bites you don't really want to go back for more.The reasons to go are ambiance, locations and desserts. The service is also top notch and presentation was beautiful so again, you go to one of these restaurants like Boulud Sud, Daniel, Nougatine, etc. for the experience. I keep hoping I'll try one more of these Boulud restaurants and be blown away by the food, but so far the best one in my opinion is Nougatine.Wish they would learn to cut back on the level of salt bc everything else is great about this location.",0,0,0,K R.,"Manhattan, NY",7,113,143

Flavor was great but texture was kinda funny. I ordered the spicy green shakshouka, made with green harissa and labneh, and topped with a soft-poached egg ($19 with choice of soup or salad). The portion for this was smaller than I had expected--but just right--and tasted great! Very refreshing yet filling without going overboard. Loved it was green versus red--a twist! The side of soup was fantastic and really different. I recommend this over the side salad for sure.

The staff were very friendly though, and allowed us to sit at the bar until the restaurant officially opened for service at 11am. Then, we were seated at our table.We all decided to go with the 3-course fixed price option, which was a pretty good deal for brunch at $34 per person.  For my starter, I ordered the Mediterranean Mezze with spicy hummus, herb falafel, and babaganoush.  The hummus and babaganoush were both very good, but the falafel was on the salty side.My parents both ordered the potato and sunchoke soup with focaccia croutons and creme fraiche for their starters.  It was an excellent decision.  The soup was incredible.  Creamy, smooth, earthy, sweet, comforting... it was the perfect dish for a cold spring day.  We loved it.For my main course, I ordered the zhug spiced shakshouka with potato, spinach, and soft poached egg. The eggs were perfectly cooked, with just set but jiggly whites and a runny yolk. It was a delicious combination with the flavorful stewed tomatoes.My mom ordered the grilled Mediterranean daurade, which comes with a side dish.  She chose the broccolini.  The fish was very fresh, cooked nicely, and served whole, which my mom loved.  It was a very generous portion.My dad ordered the pimenton spiced steak and egg with patatas bravas, swiss chard, garlic aioli.  This was flavorful, filling, and executed very well, with the steak cooked perfectly (medium rare).For dessert, I ordered the semolina torta de santiago with macerated citrus and fior di latte gelato.  This was okay.  The cake was fairly plain and while there was nothing wrong with the individual components, the combination was kind of boring and we weren't very impressed.My mom ordered the house-made beignets with kumquat mamalade and honey glaze.  We loved this dish.  The beignets came to the table hot and they were light and fluffy.  The kumquat marmalade provided a perfect tart balance to the sweet honey glaze.  We all agreed that this was a dish that we could order again!My dad ordered the milk chocolate coffee paalet with mascarpone ice cream.  This was beautiful, but not mind-blowing in terms of taste.  It was a classic flavor combination with solid execution.The restaurant has a bright ambiance and modern decor with friendly service and good food.

My wife felt that the food was a little too salty, but it was fine for my taste. Do try the monkfish if you can.",0,1,0,Morgan J.,"Washington, DC",449,24,16
3.0,2/11/2016,"to be honest this isn't the first time I ate at boulud sud but this last visit wasn't up to their usual standards. maybe it was my fault. after all I did come in restaurant week, I should have known better.I walked in the restaurant, and usually we are greeted with haste and seated with great service, but this time everyone seemed flustered, there were quick movements from all the staff but no one being attentive. it took a while to just get a table which we had a reservation for. I was still excited for our meal. last time I came. the escbesche which they make so well with pine nuts and white grapes was possibly the star of the meal. this time it fell flat and failed to impress me or my friend. their dips and chips have always been great. and it seems while the escbesche didn't quite deliver this time. they were seemingly going strong! the hummus and the babaganoush was so delicious that we had to get another round for the table. but it seems that everyone else was thinking quite the same and the waiter, when we asked for more bread to dip with, disappeared and never appeared again. the octopus tasted great. it was just little Chewier than it was when I had it last. mind you I don't usually go to a place again and order the same items, but I had an important client that night and wanted to show him the best of what I had at Boulud sud. whoever cooked the pasta that night however, bravo, the parpadelle with the ragu it's to die for. let's just say for pg purposes we finished that plate in 2 minutes.chicken tangine was something I looked forward to that night. last time I was here I stole I bite from my friend and couldn't stop dreaming about it since. now. everything was perfectly done. chicken nice and moist, the couscous perfectly cooked, and theres the preserved lemon which I always love. there just was no seasoning. and what a shame. so close. I believe it is partly my fault for choosing to go in restaurant week menu setting. but having been a fan of the Boulud empire, this experience really hurt me and even more so to know my client wasn't thoroughly impressed with one of the restaurants I deem of quality.

1.0,2/11/2016,"Had lunch here. Doors opened about 5 minutes late, and there was a queue at the door. That's fine, but we all watched as the hostess came and unlocked the door and then walked away without opening it for us or welcoming us in. Very awkward. She then muttered some archaisms as she took coats, like ""very good"". When I dropped my coat check, she remarked ""you dropped your coat check, *already*"" - I was particularly confused about what she was insinuating with the extra adverb at the end. Perhaps I looked like the type of person that was fated to drop my coat check? Anyway, it all made for a bad first impression. Onto the food: Sunchoke soup + cured salmon apps:Both pretty decent and inoffensive. Maybe a bit uninspired. Soup temperature wasn't quite right. Shakshouka + tagine entrees:Both obscenely salty. Shakshouka was basically glorified pasta sauce. Tagine was lots of overcooked chicken with some oily couscous and cauliflower. Our server was gracious in replacing the dry chicken when we brought it up, though seeing as the dish was not tasty, I would have preferred a comp.Panna cotta + signature grapefruit desserts:Panna cotta was not great. Texture was kind of gummy and the streusel crumbles inside were pretty hard and gross. Grapefruit dessert was extremely difficult to eat. The form factor makes no sense - imagine trying to scoop ice out of a frozen sphere on a bed of ice cubes without looking like a barbarian. The sorbet itself was pretty good.

I would give this restaurant 6 stars if it was an option. Every single dish I had was amazing and the staff was great! The menu has a mediterranean influence. I tried the octopus for the first course. It was the best I have ever had. It was tender and had so many different flavors that made it so good. Service was exceptional and on point. I enjoyed the chicken dish that was served on the menu for restaurant week.Cocktails were perfectly prepared too! Speciality cocktails are the way to go. I enjoyed a French 64! It was similar to the classic champagne cocktail French 75 but since it is on 64th street that is why they named it this to have a little bit of a twist on a classic.

Service was good, nothing out of ordinary.For appetizers my friend ordered the potato sunchoke soup, which has a smooth, creamy, rich texture and unusual but appetizing taste, and I got citrus cured organic salmon, which was a few pieces of salmon with some greens in a nice sauce with nuts. Nothing mindblowing, but with the fresh bread provided for the table, the citrus sauce tasted really well.As a main course, my friend got house made ricotta and mushroom ravioli with spinach puree and truffles, which was absolutely amazing. The green puree looked amazing--I have never seen such bright emerald color before, and the whole dish tasted great. I got the lab burger and I can freely admit that it was the best burger of my life--the lamb was done medium rare and was still juicy and flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed that meat! The huge, thick pieces of fries were made from polenta or something of that sort, which I did not enjoy, but the lamb made up for that.Dessert was amazing. The chocolate coffee panna cotta was brilliant--the best panna cotta I ever had. It was very smooth and creamy, came in a cup, and had caramel at the bottom and cookie crumbs on the top. Hands down the most worthy ending of our meal. I got house made ice cream--vanilla, chocolate, and pink rose. Pink rose ice cream was phenomenal--reminded me of wild pink roses that grew in my neighborhood when I was a child.

I was really curious about the octopus appetizer so I upgraded my meal to a ~$50 special. The octopus was a disappointment. Small, chewy pieces dropped over arugula and eggplant or hummus. I was expecting something much better from a Mediterranean bistro. My colleague had the Mezze which was an excellent mix and well prepared appetizer. The lamb shoulder special was great as of the meat part but the side puree and sauce combination was way too sweet. The sweetness was really overpowering the meal so I kept drinking 3 glasses of water with some wine to wash it off.   The desserts were excellent but I already had my weekly portion of sugar with the main course.

Picture old money men all suited up and combed back, sitting with Mrs. Refinement.The meal began with a very unusual and downright ceremonial ""presentation"" of the star of the evening....some lumps of white truffles presented on top of raw rice in a fancy wood box. Picture the nicest portable litter box ever. Check my posted pic of this. Has anyone seen this before?? And our waiter was really quite wierd.  PIcture an effeminate Ken doll with some bad plastic surgery, a detached attitude, and a provider of consistently subpar service which even other waiters notice and compensated for. But beyond these somewhat humorous distractions our meal was sheer perfection. Octopus on a bed of purued almonds (among other things) and an EPIC jamon iberco got us off to an impressive start, then a downright sublime pan-poasted halibut and exquisite and exotic chicken taurine as our mains.

1.0,9/7/2015,"If this had been my first time at Boulud Sud, I would never return.  To start, they had no clue about our dietary requirements, even though my husband and I dine here regularly. We also communicated these restrictions when the reservation was made, then confirmed. Our server was not very hospitable, nor was he very talented at describing the various dishes. He was not much better at taking orders either: he forgot our ""to share"" plate until after we were halfway through our appetizers.  It would not be a big deal if the food had been decent but it sucked so much that we inquired if the ""old"" chef had left. My ""setas and huevo"" were way too salty and greasy (and I LOVE salt and fat) and my husband's tomato risotto tasted like an odd dessert. That's right, it was weird, lemony and sweet.  Then, the forgotten crispy artichoke arrived: we had been told the artichokes would be grilled, not fried but these were deep fried and swimming in oil, soggy and very unappetizing. Our main courses were just as disastrous. We watched my husband's lamb chops sitting in the hot window for at least twenty minutes - they became overcooked with dried out sides and sauce by the time the dish was served.  It was simply disgusting and we were shocked that they would even serve such a thing. I believe they made a mistake with my entree and had to remake parts of it, hence the wait.  I had the rougette, which was okay but everything else on the plate (petite ratatouille, zucchini flower, shrimp) was, sadly, cold. They didn't make up for this misery with the dessert either. After carefully discussing several items on the dessert menu with our server, he helped me choose the grapefruit givre - only to come back and say: ""Our pastry chef says you can't have that.

It might have been a little loud with an older crowd, but that is honestly the only complaint I had. We were sat down promptly, and we were quickly able to give our order. Shortly thereafter the deliciousness began. The house bread was perfectly baked and some of the most flavourful olive oil I've ever tasted was served for dipping. It even had sea salt and fresh pepper! As an appetizer, I had house cured salmon served with a yoghurt sauce, essentially tzatziki. The fish was perfectly done, and the tzatziki had the perfect amount of dill, garlic and lemon.

4.0,8/10/2015,"I enjoyed a Friday lunch w/ my sister for the RW menu.Since we have Summer Fridays at the office, I booked a weekday lunch away from my usual lunch break of 20 mins gourmet cuisine called eating at my desk. Having an actual weekday lunch is a real and rare treat(esp a walk in Central Park after!!)Picking between the Boulud restaurants was difficult but we ultimately narrowed down our search to the one with more options as we are picky eaters. I made last minute reservations to Boulud Sud the night before since their menu seemed better than the other DB restaurants on RW. Boulud Sud is the Mediterranean brother to Bar Boulud next door. The RW menu is very similar, with the same ingredients but Boulud Sud had more interesting sounding options in my part.I made 2:15 reservations for lunch(they stop serving their lunch menu at 2:30) and I was running 5 minutes late but they were able to hold my table. The entrance is kind of tricky because you have multiple Boulud locations within the same corner of Lincoln Center. The entrance is to the side and has doors like some sort of stainless steel submarine. Interesting and quirky at the same time. The dining area was spacious and well lit. The dress code is advise to be smart casual but you may want to go a little more ""smart"" than casual. In other words you shouldn't wear sneakers and ripped jeans.The space is very big yet the tables felt very crowded. I could hear my neighbors better than I could hear my sister. I was literally about 6"" away from my neighbor and could hear her entire conversation with her mother/grandmother. It was a little awkward. I could even hear the conversation of the couple next to us, two tables down and how uncomfortable it felt because they were probably on their first few dates and they didn't know what to talk about so they spent their entire meal taking pictures and talking about what they're eating. I'm pretty sure both sides of the tables heard about my upcoming vacation and work trip too because if I hear your business you're bound to hear mine. UGH pet peeves. -1 star because of that.Anyways, the menu looked pretty darn great, as expected with no surprises. I ordered the Andalusian tomato watermelon gazpacho w/ croutons and the sister got the Lebanese fattoush salad. The gazpacho was a great starter as it was light and refreshing. The unexpected watermelon bites added a hint of sweetness that complimented so well with the tartness of the tomatoes. The fattoush salad was a little boring. It is basically a side salad with pita chips and hummus. The hummus was very fresh and delicious though, but the rest of the salad was a little drab and extremely watery from being not well drained + the sumac vinaigrette. But the bread was pretty delicious with the olive oil. I believe the bread is rosemary, which is a little nontraditional to the basic bread and oil service but load up on your carbs here and work our later because the bread is so soft, unlike any bread I've had before.For the entree I got ratatouille et ouefs mollet and sister got the buffalo milk ricotta cavatelli. Assuming it is Daniel's own French grandma's recipe I had extremely high expectations for. The ouefs mollet(soft boiled egg) was perfect. Cracking the yoke is the most satisfying part if you're into any of that food porn stuff. It was served with two pieces of the same rosemary bread as before. The presentation is interesting, on a wooden serving plate. Very cute and rustic touch to a ""homemade"" dish. From what I can tell from eating ratatouille just about every day in Paris for dinner, this is a very authentic recipe. It's seasoned really well, and not too salty which is perfect the way I like it. The only difference I would say is the French get their food locally in the market or they grow it themselves. The difference is you can taste the life in the food that you cannot find in the States. Call me picky but the quality of the ingredients really makes a difference. Boulud Sud was very close.My sisters cavatelli was just OK. The buffalo ricotta was a nice flavor but it really needed to stand out more instead of being mixed into the pesto.For dessert I had the house made ice creams, the flavors that day were Rose, Strawberry and Apricot. Sister had the Gianduja and it was amazing, it almost tasted like a deconstructed Ferrero Rocher with gelato. I enjoyed the sampling of the house made ice creams, it changes daily but I had to jump on it when I heard they had Rose(anything rose flavored I LOVE.) The apricot was a little too tart and overwhelming for me, but the strawberry was fresh and the rose was phenomenal(do they have this stuff for sale to go???) I would 10/10 have the rose again. Absolutely love it.I'll leave you with a word of advice: make reservations, order dessert, take a date here to impress them, but don't sit in the 2-seat tables parallel to one other, or risk your conversations being the highlight of the next person's Yelp review ;)",5,3,3,Lilly T.,"New York, NY",142,138,144

2.0,8/5/2015,"I had so looked forward to lunch here, and I went during Restaurant Week.  The restaurant is open and roomy and I was given an excellent table.  I had checked the menu in advance and was looking forward to an excellent lunch  And it started off well.  The breads were excellent, the olive bread was wonderful -- I asked the server where to purchase it -- and my salmon tartare with an avocado dressing was delicious.  Then I had the  ""Z'hug Spiced Albacore Tuna.""  The menu did not indicate cooking style, but the server said it would be ""rare.""  I like tuna sashimi and tataki so as long as it was not ""well-cooked"" (read ""tough""), this was fine with me.  However, when it arrived, it had clearly been frozen and then unfrozen unsuccessfully, as the flesh was mushy, not firm -- extremely disappointing.  But I decided not to send it back -- this turned out to be a mistake.Since the ice creams were homemade, and one choice was rose, I had ordered the trio.  The rose was tasteless and slightly crystallized, the cocoa flavor was slightly bitter and the apricot was sour -- none had enough flavor.  I gave the largely uneaten plate to the server who accepted it without comment, never asking me if it (or the tuna) was ok. I also had a Restaurant Week signature cocktail which was light and lemony, but appeared to lack the gin promised.My bill came with a $15 appetizer I never ordered added on, and the server had to redo it.At no point, did any of the management staff come by any of the tables to ask how things were, so when I spoke to the manager on my way out, he said, ""If I had known, I would have done something for you.""  But he never came by my table, or any other table for that matter.  My reservation was for 1:45 on a Wednesday afternoon, so Boulud Sud was just moderately busy, it would have been nice had the managers taken the trouble to speak to diners as they were eating   So all in all, for a place of this stature, Boulud Sud is nothing more than mediocre.  I was told that this week, they have ""double the usual number of covers,"" if my meal was typical, they will not get repeat customers..",0,0,0,d e.,"Manhattan, NY",0,42,0

Both appetizers were delicious, light, and very fresh. The salmon crudo was on a bed of dill yogurt that was perfect for a hot summer day.For entrees we had the merlu (fish) that came a top pea purée and sea beans. I had the lamb burger which was truly excellent - perfectly cooked lamb with grilled eggplant, grilled onions, a piece of fried saganaki cheese, Harissa sauce, some greens, and a yogurt sauce.

Probably the best thing we had the entire meal, perfectly grilled, a good portion, with a plethora of arugula. ($10 supplement)-I, the Ruby Shrimp in garlic oil- yummy Spanish chili oil, yummy foccicia for mopping up oil and a healthy portion of perfectly cooked shrimp.($5 supplement)-He, the Chicken Tagine ($7 supplement). Again, a healthy portion- chicken was well seared, tended to be a little bit dry, but that could be just us. I guess we have had tagine, more like a stew (more broth) in the past. It still came with cute, decorative tagine cookware. -I, the vegetable handmade ravioli which came with a flavorful green sauce, and corn, asparagus- all those good summer veggies. -We shared the signature Tunisian brik which was so unique and delicious- it was kind of like a Nicoise salad tucked in with egg, tuna, gruyere, capers in a delicate pastry-like shell. Ahhmazing. -Dessert, which was again very inventive.  I had the Givre, which was divine!  I love tart sorbet like things and that's what this was- a grapefruit gelee, with sorbet inside of a frozen grapefruit shell. Mm, Mm. -The Mr had the mocha cube which was an artful play on mocha/chocolate, and coffee (think it was coffee ice cream).  I had tea to finish off the meal, and he had coffee. We came at noon, and the restaurant wasn't that full but when we left at 1:30-ish it got pretty busy.  I highly recommend BS for RW or just in general.

By far one of the best sea bass dishes I've come across. (We often try it from many different restaurants). Many different flavors, all complimenting each other with every bite.

Also the cannoli, instead of your topical round shell, they were square with filling in between with pieces of fruit and a dollop of sorbet.

He has basically taken over the culinary scene  in Manhattan. I am usually a huge fan of his restaurants and so when a friend of mine suggested Boulud Sud for dinner, I was shocked. How had I never heard of this place? Cut me some slack people. I've only been back in NYC for 8 months!We made an early reservation and it was already packed. DECORI found the decor to be a little odd. I couldn't put my finger on what it was, but I just felt it was odd. We were also seated very closely to another table (aka right on top of them) and it made the night pretty awkward as not only could they hear every part of our entire conversation (and kept staring over at us the entire evening) but the waiter decided that in order to access their table, he would come in-between our table and theirs. This was a little awkward as the waiters rear was constantly in my friends face. In a restaurant of this ""caliber"" I would not expect that to happen.We ordered the shrimp ""gambas"" (my auto-correct kept trying to change this to mambas...what the hell is a mamba?!) and they were heavenly. It's pretty rare for shrimp to knock the socks off of me, but these did it. MUST ORDER!For my main course, I ordered the chicken tagine. I love chicken tagine. I've been to Morocco and literally ate this dish every day for 2 straight weeks, so believe me people, I know what I'm talking about over here. This was not that great. I felt the sauce was really bland and the chicken slightly dry. I wasn't impressed. I should have known better than to order chicken, but it's rare to see this dish on a menu and I wanted to take advantage of that.I think this is a great restaurant to take work colleagues or clients, but not for a nice meal amongst friends.

3.0,4/28/2015,"I'm kind of torn about whether to give Boulud Sud 3 or 4 stars so I'll split it down the middle and say 3.5.Had a 5pm reservation on a Friday evening.  We were given a nice table in a far corner where we could watch the action in the entire dining room.  Thought we would have a nice quiet dinner before attending a school play nearby so didn't expect a packed house by 6pm.  Noise level wasn't too bad, if you ignored the shouting (dinner orders) that went on in the partially open kitchen.  When dining at the restaurant before 7pm, they only offer a 3-course prix fixemenu for $60 but they also offer additional apps, such as the sea urchin & crab tartine that we ordered.  I thought the tartine (four bite-size pieces) was underwhelming; could hardly taste the uni.  For my 3 courses, I had the sheep's milk ricotta gnocchi, Catalan ""paella"" (made with short fried angel-hair-like noodles instead of rice) and the mocha cube.  I thought all of my dishes were creative and tasty.  Hubby ordered the octopus app, lemon-saffron linguini and sutlac (Turkish rice pudding).  He was underwhelmed by his linguini and thought his portions could have been bigger.  I tasted his linguini and thought it was underseasoned and didn't see too many razor clams in it.  I liked the rice pudding.Service was better than average but still lacking the polish that you'd find at Betony and Le Bernardin.   Our empty plates should have been cleared sooner than they were.The bill was about average for a decent NYC dinner - including a cocktail, glass of wine and coffee each, bill came out to about $115 per person before tax and tip.If we're ever in the Lincoln Center area, we would probably go back to Boulud Sud.  They seem to have a nice outdoor and indoor bar area.",0,0,0,Aly Y.,"Morristown, NJ",12,268,12
3.0,4/27/2015,"Around the corner from Cafe Boulud this Daniel Boulud restaurant specializes in Mediterranean fare.  Having dined at Cafe, I find the food here a notch below.  The decor and feel is definitely more upscale than Cafe, but that's about it. It's just as noisy and crowded. I started with the Mediterranean Mezze, which is 3 small ramekins filled with Spicy Moroccan Hummus, Herb Falafel and Babaganoush along with some pita chips. Rather small for the price and only the spicy hummus was interesting.  For the main course I had the Catalan Paella ""FIDEUÀ"" which featured Daurade à la Plancha (a seabream fish), Chorizo and Shrimp Aïoli.  The fish was overcooked and although the dish was tasty, not memorable.This is an OK restaurant if you're attending something around Lincoln Center but not one that I would go out of my way to try again. I'll stick with Cafe Boulud just around the corner instead.Bar Review - 12/12/2015The bar is rectangular with seating for maybe 20 people. There were 2 bartenders working (6:20PM) and not all bar seats were filled.  I still had to wait 10 mins before one of the bartenders came over to ask if I was being helped.  Then to top it off, I waited another 10 mins to get a check.

I always enjoy the intricate flavors and how they whip up a special restricted diet preferences often perfectly as requested.Reception is always gracious and prompt as well as super accommodating.There is however an issue I have with Seating & with bringing Children to a place where they are not happy campers...   Seating is over crowded. You are literally sitting closer to your neighbor than your dining companion exacerbated by depth of table length. Meaning you make fast friends or find it uncomfortable to listen to intimate conversation. Also, I always fear the waiter will spill something on me, my partner or the guys next to us as they squeeze through or literally reach over the head of the person facing the bench seat. It totally stresses me out during a meal. As for Temperature, it's cold in the back, temps are better up front, so you have to hope to be seated where you wont freeze.This place is not a place for strollers and children who are fidgety. You ruin it for us and more importantly you ruin it for your kids, as they are forced to behave and sit tight for an inordinate amount of time waiting to be served.

4.0,2/24/2015,"I came here with some of my colleagues during Restaurant Week for lunch. I know that a RW experience may not reflect an experience at that restaurant any other time, given the smaller, different menu, but I still enjoyed my time here. The food was good enough for me to be curious about a second visit outside of RW, and the service was so attentive.The space was very large, and it buzzed with the sounds of conversations, laughter, and the clanking of silverware, but it wasn't enough to make hearing my dining companions a problem. When we came for lunch, a lot of light came in from the windows and the space seemed warm and inviting. I thought it'd be stuffy given the Lincoln Center location, but it wasn't like that at all.1). Potato and Sunchoke SoupThis was such a huge portion! I couldn't believe this was an appetizer and I would have wanted to come here on an emptier stomach had I known portions would be so large! It also seemed so filling because the addition of the crème fraîche made it extra creamy. The blended potatoes and sunchoke created a very sweet and nutty soup, but I think the generous pour of olive oil was a bit distracting. 2). Hand-Rolled Lemon Ricotta CavatelliThe cavatelli was cooked perfectly; the wild mushrooms and walnut pesto made this a very lovely, filling dish, and it was rounded out by hints of tart lemon ricotta. They were a little too heavy-handed with the salt in the pesto, though. Other than that, this was a top-notch dish.Note: The harissa grilled lamb burger was a popular entreé item as we saw many of these giant, stacked burgers being carried around the dining room. My colleague really loved this burger - enough to save half to take home! Also, I rarely ever leave with a doggy bag so I wouldn't know if this is common or not (perhaps I'm a glutton?), but when she asked to have the burger wrapped up, she was given a number tag. Similar to a coat check, her food was packed up and ready to take as we were leaving. No awkward Styrofoam or paper boxes were kept on our table.3). Rose Panna CottaThis pink and green dessert was very cute and spring-themed! The panna cotta tasted very much like a rose, and paired well with pistachio gelato. The sponge cake, also green, was very spongy.Likelihood of another visit:I would gladly visit again for lunch or dinner after a movie at the Lincoln Square AMC.",9,5,8,Maki Y.,"New York, NY",288,244,358
5.0,2/24/2015,"Background: Visited on Sunday night at 730pm with a few friends for Restaurant Week. (Don't forget to explicitly ask for the restaurant week menu).Food: Excellent! Appetizer: I went with the potato and sunchoke soup - perfectly creamy yet not too thick, and the artichoke taste was nice and subtle.Entree: Niman Ranch Braised Pork Shank with polenta, carrots and pine nut gremolata. It was tasty and came right off the bone, but my friends and I thought it was a bit too salty. The polenta helped balance it out.And finally the highlight - Dessert: Mocha cube ($5 supplement). As a chocolate lover I was obviously obligated to pay the extra cost. Large portion, smooth texture, rich, decadent, very satisfying. If you're not into rich chocolate desserts, don't get this.Atmosphere: On the fancy side. Coat check at the door, nice decor, good lighting, dishes prepared with nice presentation. Good for special occasions.Service: Next level - the second I took my last bite of food, a flock of waiters swooped in to remove plates. Waters were filled more than enough throughout the meal.Overall: Although I've been disappointed with Restaurant week outings in the past, Boulud Sud did not disappoint.

Most of the good dishes in their Restaurant Week menu have supplemental charges - with these sup. charges you are paying the same amount as the pre-theater dinner. You ended up saving nothing (then what is the point of having the restaurant week menu)!!! I had Ruby Red shrimp ($5 sup.),  ($10 sup.), and grapefruit dessert ($5 sup.). You can see my total was $58 - only $2 away from the regular pre-theater dinner. My food was fine. I did enjoyed the scallops. My husband had octopus ($8 sup.), pork shanks, and Tiramisu. He didn't like the pork. We ordered 2 cocktails - they were way too sour and tasted like cheap fruit soda. Very disappointed. Now I want to comment about the service. Our waiter disappeared after the entrees were served (we never see him back so I guess his has left for the day). Then my area became waiter-less and we couldn't find someone to get the check for us.

5.0,2/20/2015,"I was also here for the Winter Restaurant Week menu this evening and mused over the edible highlights of the meal my whole ride home.  I was married 2 months ago and we have since been wined and dined as a continued celebration in an array of big hitter spots in NYC.  I'd say this one held its own as a contender.  The ingredients used in the restaurant's dishes are an imaginative arsenal from things grown and used near the Mediterranean. The afore-written-about chicken liver mousse had several of us dreamily rolling our eyes from its unctuous gifts and it was combined with a sprightly, creamy citrus marmalade, crisp toast rounds, and fluffy salad greens.  The lemon/ricotta cavatelli was also rewardingly rich from which toasty bread bits, mushrooms, and strands of arugula could be harvested from the walnut pesto.  My cleverly assembled dessert was a memorable way to spend 10 minutes!  I had the rose-flavored panna cotta that was topped with a scoop of more viscous and intense pistachio gelato, and framed with soft mounds of what seemed a pistachio sponge cake that evanesced in the mouth leaving shards of exceedingly thin sweet wafers.  The interplay between textures and flavor intensities was rewarding and engrossing.  Our waiter told us this item was conjured especially for this month's Winter Menu but he hopes, as do I, that it's something that will take on a more protracted residency in their repertoire.  The excellent service was refined, thoughtful, discrete, and with clever frills, some of the best I've had in this city.  Something I hadn't seen before:  a numbered plastic stub was left on the table so to retrieve leftovers going home on the way out.",0,0,0,Andrew A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0

Well, first of all, I wouldn't pay normal prices for this food. Secondly, there were a number of dishes that were kind of average. The chicken liver mousse was completely overpowered by the apricot, and even tasted by itself was relatively flavorless. The chicken tajine was good, but I've had better and much cheaper restaurants.

4.0,2/17/2015,"Came here yesterday with some work buddies for restaurant week lunch. This was my first time at a Daniel Boulud restaurant and I was excited to see what was in store!The waiters were all extremely polite and attentive. I don't recall a single moment when my water glass was more than 1/2 empty. When we sat down, we were immediately served with a platter warm bread and olive oil, which was refilled as needed. This is what I ordered:Appetizer - Tuscan chicken liver mousse Entree - Harissa grilled lamb burger Dessert - Grapefruit Givre The chicken liver mousse was alright. It was served as a thin spread on a plate along with a scoop of what tasted like orange marmalade and a simple salad. It came with three small pieces of crispy bread, which were burnt on the edges. The mousse itself was quite good, but the marmalade and salad were just mediocre and rather random.Lamb burger was excellent! Easily my favorite part of the meal. It was the most loaded burger I've ever had. The menu said it came with eggplant; little did I know that it was going to be INSIDE the burger! Also inside was a generous slice of saganaki, or fried cheese, and a delicious spicy Harissa sauce. I could barely finish my burger. Polenta fries were okay - thickly cut with a nice crispy texture but otherwise bland.Now for the famous Grapefruit Givre dessert. Probably the most creative dish I've had, ever. It's basically a grapefruit filled with sorbet, rose candy, and sesame cream, then topped with a hardened caramel hat and a pile of white, cotton-candy like hair. Like whaaaat, who even came up with this? I was a bit overwhelmed with all the textures and flavors. Sorbet was super refreshing and very grapefruit-y.

3.0,2/13/2015,"Last night I had dinner at Boulud Sud before catching a performance at Lincoln Center. The location couldn't be better if you're planning to see an event there. I was very excited to dine here with my boyfriend as it was written up very highly and it was a special occasion. When I first arrived I checked my coat and extra bag and sat at the bar to have a cocktail before my partner arrived. The interior is very well designed. The recessed lighting and unique furniture choices make the space feel truly unique and unlike many of the Brooklyn Boheme places we have gotten so used to dining at. Right off the bat I waited a good 7 minutes to be given a drink menu and be acknowledged even though there were just four others seated at the bar (happily munching and drinking away). The bartender wasn't even present as he had gone to get more martini glasses. Stepping away didn't seem like the best idea and there were plenty of aimless bar hands around that could have grabbed the glasses. I saw the manager searching for him as he saw me waiting. When the bartender returned he wiped down the martini glasses before coming to me. When he finally did get to me he was very cordial and made an excellent Embajador. We were seated as soon as my date arrived and service from there on out was very attentive and good. However, surprisingly, I was underwhelmed with the food I ate overall.  I had a tuna tartare appetizer that was too spicy (and I do like spicy foods!). My main dish of Daurade was underwhelming as well and lacked flavor. Desert was amazing- the mocha cube. The plate presentation stole the show. My boyfriend was happy with his shrimp appetizer and main entree but felt his desert pudding was quite bad. So the food, which we expected to be the highlight was actually quite hit or miss.  The efficiency of the servers did allow us to make our show on time which was a huge plus. At the end we picked up our coats and as I later came to realize... Not my bag that I had checked!! Since I was excited for the show and evening I didn't remember to ask.  I feel it was their responsibility to bring it to me once I gave them my coat-check ticket. I had to go back today to get my belongings which was a huge inconvenience. My water bottle was missing from the bag as well but I'm assuming it just felt out since my bag didn't have a zipper and more valuable belongings weren't missing.

5.0,1/7/2015,"Celebrated mom's 70th b-day with a trip to the Met.  Chose this restaurant based on reviews, interesting menu, and location.  It was a splendid experience.Agree with previous review that it's not an intimate, romantic restaurant, but that's not what I was looking for.  Wanted somewhere lively and festive, but not too loud.Be aware that they only serve prix-fixe prior to 7:00, so they can get people out to the theater.  So this is what we had, and it was perfect.  Plenty of options, enough food, but not huge portions such that you fall asleep at the opera.I thought everything was well done and delicious.  We had 3 people and all got something different.  Appetizer shrimp were very tender.  Breads were fabulous, and so were desserts.  Least favorite was rice pudding, but it was still nice and light.  The chocolate dessert looked like something out of MOMA, and while I would normally shy away from any dessert with 'grapefruit' in the title, I decided it was a must-try after reading the reviews.  And they were correct - it's an experience.  You can get chocolate mousse anywhere, but I don't think I'm going to come across this - a hollowed-out grapefruit (those poor prep guys!) filled with a chunky sorbet and topped with a sugar sculpture - anywhere else.Can't speak to the wine list, as I'm not knowledgeable.Service was great, as one would expect.",0,0,0,Victoria J.,"Charlotte, NC",0,33,0

The cocktails were well made (husband approved of his negroni), and the staff were mindful of the timing of the service without making the experience feel rushed. The ambiance was quite casual, although we racked up quite a large bill.

3.0,1/4/2015,"Had a pre-theatre prix fixe before watching the opera at the Met (location is perfect for this).  The dining experience was good but I expected better.  Just to settle any expectations:  the restaurant lacks the intimate setting of a fine dining establishment, especially on a busy Friday night.  Try to avoid the middle tables or the ones near the kitchen as they can be loud and uncomfortable.  Highlights for me included the grapefruit givré dessert (a complex, interesting dessert) and the fact that you can have relatively generous truffle shavings on any dish (for a supplement, of course).  Had the foie gras/venison (not the best combination) terrine for appetizer, with black truffle shavings.It being a Mediterranean/French restaurant, I ordered Moroccan tagine for the main course.  Compared to what I had in Fez, Morocco, this one seems bland--though if I were to have it as simply a chicken dish (and not tagine), I would have liked it.  The saffron in the saffron linguini (husband's main dish) was a little too subtle and I could barely discern it.  Though it looked good, it didn't taste very unique, in my opinion.Service was good.  Overall, I would say, come here for truffle shavings, dessert, and dishes other than the ones I mentioned.",1,0,0,Charisse B.,"Bloomsburg, PA",45,7,20

The decor is modern and lovely and the bread/oil served was quite delicious - one was similar to a focaccia, the other an incredible olive bread that I devoured.We started off with the mezze appetizer (hummus, falafel, babaganoush, served with 3-4 chips). While the platter was delicious, there were only 3-4 chips so it was hard to finish the rest of it without just eating it with a fork. Luckily, our waiter realized this and about 10 minutes later, he dropped off some more chips without us having to ask.I had been excited to try the shakshouka since reading the menu online and while it was delicious, the cumin in the dish felt slightly out of place and odd. I LOVE shakshouka traditionally, but the cumin in this one kind of ruined it for me - and I happen to like cumin! It just didn't work here. The goat cheese, potatoes and croutons were nice complements, however.My mother ordered the Tunisian brik, a puff-pastry sort of dish that had tuna and capers on the inside. It was fantastic!  We each had one mimosa ($16 each!!) and finished with a cup of tea and coffee. For 2 mimosas, one appetizer, two entrees, and one cup of tea and coffee, the bill came to $107.

5.0,12/15/2014,"Daniel Boulud's Mediterranean restaurant offers fine dining in an engaging, casual environment just steps from Lincoln. We know that for a fact because we walked to Boulud Sud from a late matinee performance at the Metropolitan Opera -- it took five minutes from the entrance to the Met to the entrance to the restaurant, including two traffic delays. The restaurant has a surprisingly extensive three-course prix fixe menu ($60) for pre-show diners, and everything our party of four tasted turned out to be delightful, including the  burgundy and beaujolais (by the glass) we ordered. We started with several of the house cocktails, wonderfully prepared (especially ""From the Field"" which features lightly sweetish, refreshing honey comb and lavender-infused gin. To die for).  The kitchen is open, which allows diners to sneak peeks at the food prep, almost as much fun as eating the food. Almost, but not quite. High praise for the shrimp, hummus and mushroom appetizers, all zesty and appealingly presented, and also for the  bread selection, served with garlic oil and spices.For dinner, the grilled Bavette steak was a perfect medium rare, thin sliced and moist. Similarly for the spiced lamb loin (with spectacular Egyptian eggplant) and for the spiced sea scallops, so tender and tasty with a very light, moist crust. For dessert, a choice of six selections, we opted for the house-made ice cream (a simple but apt close to this memorable meal) and the chocolate cube, hauntingly caloric and yummy. The service was excellent, attentive and knowledgeable. We just couldn't come up with negatives, and didn't feel we had to.

3.0,11/14/2014,"It was surprisingly empty for a Friday lunch. I was tempted by the bar because I saw all the fresh citrus, and I settled on the Embajador: tequila, grapefruit, spicy agave. It had a nice kick and a large ice cube in the center (not a clear one), but there were bits of crushed ice in the drink - clearly not double strained.  Flavor wise, it was good We had olive bread and focaccia to start. They do a $29 3-course lunch pre-fixe, which is a good deal. - Mediterranean mezze: the highlight was the well seasoned falafel, freshly fried and warm. The roasted red pepper hummus and baba ganouj were light and smooth but slightly under seasoned for me, and I expected a little more smokiness from the baba ganouj- Egg shashouka: Harissa and crushed tomato with perfectly soft cooked eggs in the center.  The tomato was well seasoned, not too acidic, and it had just the right amount of feta. It comes with focaccia, but I would have preferred a bread that could better stand up to the warm, saucy dish (crusty bread maybe?)- Ice cream: black tea, rose, chocolate, all house made. I didn't love the rose, but the chocolate was a nice dark chocolate that wasn't too sweet, and the black tea was really good, too.  The ice cream is more on the icy side (less rich), which I actually prefer, especially earlier in the dayGood comes out pretty quickly, so it would be good for a business lunch.",1,0,0,Marilyn T.,"Palo Alto, CA",81,2089,202

The mushroom special though was amazing. Mushrooms and crutons were roasted together then served with a mushroom cream sauce and poached egg. It was perfect.

We spoke to the manager when we left to express our concern-we noticed no one in the kitchen wears gloves. it would seem that nowadays hygiene would be paramount. We paid a lot for our meal. I hope that Mr Boulud sees this and instructs his staff in appropriate hygiene.I would hate to see the Department of Health cite him.

4.0,10/14/2014,"From the moment we arrived we were escorted directly to our seat, however the hostess did not give us the prix fix menu that we saw being offered online and we had to wait for the waiter to come over and check on us to receive it. The prix fix menu had decent options, however most of the table chose to order a la carte because we wanted the opportunity to order freely. The bread that was placed on the table while we were analyzing the menu set the standard for the meal from the very beginning because it was perfection. It was extremely garlicky in a great way with seasoning and salt giving it that extra added flavor and bite.We started with the octopus, which is one of our favorite dishes to order when offered at a restaurant. It was prepared in a very unique way, where it was over an almond puree with clementines, arugula, and crunchy almonds. The almond puree was the consistency of smooth hummus, which offset the crunchiness of the actual almonds in the dish. The clementines and vinegar gave the perfect level of acidity to the dish and made me want to lick the bowl! And of course the octopus itself was cooked perfectly and there was a lot of it!Secondly, we were given the mezze platter, which consisted of spicy Moroccan hummus, falafel, and babaganoush. I actually could have gone without this platter, as it was more disappointing than enjoyable. The hummus and the babaganoush were too seasoned with spices and just tasted weird. It was almost as though they had used whole bottles of spices on this dish and it was just too much!  The falafel was flavored with mint and cilantro, which was a nice touch and a little more unique than most falafel that I have had, but still too seasoned!The sea urchin and crab tartine which was the appetizer that I was most looking forward to because it sounded so unique! The crab and sea urchin itself was amazing with lemony citrus seasoning, however it was on top of rye bread that got a little soggy if you didn't eat it immediately upon arrival to the table. We unfortunately waited to eat this appetizer third, and wished we had eaten it first to preserve the crunchiness of the bread. We each got 1 crunchy tartine, and 1 soggy tartine, but all in all still delicious!The Stokes Farm heirloom tomato salad was burrata atop a pesto puree and surrounded by heirloom tomatoes, croutons, and arugula. This dish was supposed to include watermelon and when we were all done eating we realized they were missing, which was disappointing because the sweetness was missing from the dish. The burrata bled out like it should when pricking it with a fork and was just what we were hoping for! The pesto made a very nice addition to the creaminess of the burrata and the tomatoes added the acidity that was needed. All in all, it was burrata done right! I would definitely reorder this one.Oddly, the chilled lobster salad was the worst dish at the table! Normally lobster dishes are my favorite. The description made it sound great on paper, but in reality it was missing all the flavor and the addition of the artichoke was weird. The dish also did not have nearly enough lobster as it probably should have, as it basically was non existent. The crunchy bomba rice that sat atop the dish was a nice touch and added some nice texture. The chorizo was delicious, but we didn't order a lobster salad for the chorizo!The hand-cut beef tartare was delicious. It was prepared in more of a puree type of consistency with charred scallions mixed in. I didn't taste the sauces on the plate that came with it, since it was not my appetizer, so I cannot speak for that, but the actual tartare was divine and had a beautiful presentation.On the side, we had charred broccoli rabe which was served with pepperoncini peppers and crispy shallots mixed in.  The addition of spicy from the peppers and the crispy texture of the shallots was a great idea. This was definitely a perfect way to enjoy already delicious vegetables. They were prepared in an oil base and we all enjoyed them.The olive oil crushed potatoes with garlic chips mixed in were the perfect level of garlic with many other spices that seasoned it quite nicely. The potatoes had a nice texture since they were not truly pureed like traditional mashed potatoes are.For dessert, we ordered this dessert that we kept seeing everyone in the restaurant order and figured this must be the one to order! The grapefruit givre had phenomal presentation with even better taste! A grapefruit was stuffed with grapefruit  sorbet and then topped with sesame halva. I don't even like grapefruit and I loved this dessert! The sorbet was so fresh and tart and the addition of the sweet halva was amazing. The halva had a cotton candy consistency which was pretty unique and made it fun to eat!Lastly, we had the chocolate mousse. This dessert was equally beautiful and was rich as rich can be. For chocolate lovers!Would definitely return, but will definitely skip the mezze platter!",1,2,0,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

Upon entering, we assumed that it was going to be a very ornate, classy restaurant since normally it is so expensive. However the interior is very open and unassuming and pretty casual. The chairs actually seemed and felt like office chairs where you wanted to keep bouncing up and down. Anyways now to the food. The restaurant week menu isn't really one because all the dishes that they're famous for (octopus etc) costs extra. For appetizer: A friend and I ordered the octopus and the salmon. The octopus was absolutely delicious and worth the extra surcharge. It didn't have the chewy consistency that octopus normally has and had great deep flavor. The salmon which didn't have an extra cost was absolutely delicious and had large slices of salmon. Great portions and very delicious. For the main course, we both ordered the steak and it wasn't that great. My steak was medium and it still had to take some chewing to break it down and make it soft. The eggplant had a little kick to it as well but it wasn't anything special that I would remember or want to order again. I got the chocolate cremeux for dessert and it was a thick and rich chocolate cake. This was definitely better than the main course and the strawberry gelato was great as well. tl;dr Probably wouldn't go again because the food wasn't amazing enough to justify the price.

Combined with high ceilings and an entire wall of windows, you get a very airy restaurant, and it definitely gets a more casual feel.The restaurant week menu was pretty hit or miss - I would say it was kind of a 'fake' restaurant week menu because everything worth getting had a supplement.Appetizer:The octopus, which is an existing dish at the restaurant, is a definite winner. I don't know how they prepared it, but it didn't taste like any kind of octopus I've ever had. It wasn't tough or hard to eat like octopus usually is, but it was firm and had a great texture to it, and was very flavorful. The salmon, which didn't have a supplement, was actually a close second - very tangy, and definitely my favorite part of dinner.Main course: The steak was alright. Nothing spectacular, and the portion was on the small to medium size. The eggplant was pleasantly spicy, but it was not anything that you couldn't get elsewhere.Dessert: Pretty meh, I honestly can't even remember what I got so I figure it wasn't very memorable. Our waiter was very nice but very stiff at first - it wasn't until he made a mistake (he laid out our utensils for the main course after we had already had our main course) that he really loosened up; definitely liked him a lot more afterwards.

Our waiter was no where to be found after he took our order, the busboy ended up having to take over for part of the time and we still never figured out where our server went. Next, after having ordered dessert with our main dishes as part of the restaurant week meal, one family member ordered ice cream and the waiter mixed it up 3 times before actually bringing the right food. Definitely not planning to go back. That location should have a great dinning option in it, and while the restaurant is very attractive, the food and service were both incredibly disappointing.",0,0,0,Rebecca W.,"New York, NY",0,10,0

2.0,8/17/2014,"Daniel Boulud is to high end dining what Jack-in-the-box is to fast food: great marketing & lots of heartburn. We ate there last night after having had dinner at Il Mulino uptown the night before. And the contrast is startling -- Il Mulino continues to crank out solid food that meets (not exceeds) expectations. Boulud Sud was just lackluster, salty, and unmemorable. The setting is amazing/relaxing but our party of 4 ordered pretty wildly across the menu and no one remarked on how great it was.

4.0,8/4/2014,"Despite the fact that Restaurant Week meals should rarely be indicators of the quality of a restaurant, every now and then one will surprise you.  Well, my meal at Boulud Sud was one of those rare exceptions.  The restaurant 's prices are usually higher than most other spaces participating in this event, which makes it a great one to try.  Also, the space is beautiful - high ceilings, modern décor, large windows looking out onto an affluent street on the Upper West Side.  My arrival at Boulud Sud was greeted by one of the most friendly and conscientious hostesses around.  She was sweet, patient, and helpful.  The rest of the staff, however, was pitiful.  Our waiter had no knowledge of the wine list, so he called over the sommelier.  She was no better and started randomly selecting wines without asking us our preferences in regards to price, etc.  She also gave pitiful descriptions that provided no help whatsoever.  It was almost as if she only knew one or two wines on the menu and promoted those.  When our food was presented, the runner had to confirm with the server who had ordered what dish, rather than knowing which plate to set down at which place setting.  It was like amateur hour...Regardless, we ended up with an affordable ($39!) bottle of Greek white wine that was light, citrusy, and versatile.  Our bread basked contained 3 minuscule pieces of delicious olive bread and larger chunks of dry focaccia.  The accompanying olive oil was fragrant and flavorful, though.  In addition, we were given some oily flatbread that had a slight sweetness to it.  When it came to the appetizers, we selected the beet salad and salmon.  The Beet Salad was sourced with ingredients from a referenced farm.  The beets were placed over a sweet and creamy spread of almond skordalia and then topped with greens.  Chunks of feta cheese were scattered around the plate, and a shallot vinaigrette added a kick, though there may have been a bit too much dressing.  The Salmon had been cured with citrus, making it tangy and bright.  The thin, fresh fish was served with watermelon, radish, and a scoop of charred scallion aioli.  The creamy condiment was packed with garlic, which helped balance the acidity of the dish.  Both starters were delicious!When it came to the entrée course, the Grilled Bavette Steak was thinly sliced and tender.  It was served over a stack of a creamy, herbaceous parsley tahini and bold cumin crushed potatoes.  A Mediterranean eggplant puree was dolloped on the side of the plate, and, while it was delicious, it just seemed like an odd addition that did not mesh with the rest of the dish. Regardless, I thought every element of this dish was amazing!For dessert, we opted for the Chocolate Olive Oil Gateau.  This small, moist cake was topped with floral-shaped mounds of hazelnut cream.  It was topped with a cocoa sorbet that was absurdly rich. The whole thing screamed sinful decadence, and I loved every minute of it!For the most part, Boulud Sud triumphed at presenting a positive Restaurant Week experience, unlike many of their competitors.  I would say that I needed to return on a regular night, which would be true, but simply because I enjoyed my experience and not because I would need to give them a second chance.",2,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
2.0,8/3/2014,"This review is more for the service (rather, the attitude) of staff, rather than the food.  Husband, baby, and I live in the neighborhood and were out one evening and looking for someplace to eat.  I went inside, alone, to enquire as to whether or not they would accommodate an infant in a stroller- and I was assured by the hosts that this would be fine.  The server seemed to feel differently.  We ordered wine.. which took forever to arrive..  we were very hungry and prepared to order dinner.. When the server finally came back he asked us if we wanted to order dinner, husband said ""yes"", and the server ROLLED HIS EYES!  More restaurants need to have a clearer policy on children.  Don't tell me that my baby is welcome, but then the service says something different.  If you don't want children in your restaurant, then please just make that your policy.",5,1,0,Margaux S.,"New York, NY",25,138,0

First time i came for lunch menu and thought that was amazing so i convince myself to go try the dinner menu. when going inside this beautiful restaurant, there are two beautiful painting on the wall and seats with tables fix for a fine dining scene for a restaurant. Coming here for restaurant week was a prefect opportunity to try new trendy dishes.The staffs are friendly, nice and super knowledgeable on everything from the food to the wine pairings. hands down the best service i ever had. Lunch Menu 3 course meal $25:For the appetizer i had the octopus a la plancha, it was so yummy and well balanced flavors. For the main course i had harissa lamb burger, that was great the lamb was cooked to perfection just the way i like it medium well. For dessert i had  the chocolate olive oil gateau, this was freaking Delicious, not to sweet. Recommendation: everything they offer for the lunch menu restaurant week haha.Dinner menu 3 course meal $38:For the appetizer i had the citrus cured salmon which was flavorful and well balanced the salmon basically melts in your mouth. For the main course i had the charmoula grilled bavette steak, the steak was mouth watering and flavors are well combined and tasty. for dessert i had the gianduja mousse with candied cocoa nibs, this was great loved this dessert. Recommendation: everything on the dinner menu restaurant week haha.Overall this place is the best restaurant i ever been to in a long while.

I went with my brother and niece and her boyfriend.  I won't bore you with what we all had but I had the duck app.  It was amazing except for they put and olive on the plate not sure why did not really go with dish but no problem just did not eat it . I then had the steak and it was great very flavorful and cooked perfect.For dessert I had spice pears and they were sinful. The only negative is that while we did not feel rush stayed for 2 hrs the dishes came out very fast.  We had just finished apps and diner was out but after they let us sit so no big deal.

5.0,7/27/2014,"Came here for restaurant week on a date night.Loved the taste&presentation of the foods and just-the-right-amount-of-attention service. Nice ambience and low noise level. Yes, the crowd was more on the senior side which also helped the noise level. I agree the decor seemed a bit dated, and yah, it's definitely not a restaurant you come for the view of the skyline (this is on the street level, near Lincoln Center, among some apts) or the cool bathroom, but I thought the overall atmosphere was great. You can dress up or down.Every dish tasted very good, with a little bit of unexpected twist. This is what we had:(Complimentary) Flatbread & focaccia - yum! I really liked that the flatbread was served as they came out the oven. Wouldn't come to this restaurant just for the bread, but it was good for what it's worth. Appetizer:STOKES FARM BEET SALAD - the feta cheese and what tasted like hummus but may not have been hummus was really delicious. We did not leave any bit of it on the plate.LONG ISLAND TUNA CRUDO - fine tuna that melts in your mouth. Enjoyed the flavor/aroma of harissa very much. Also used bread to wipe the plate clean :PEntree:SLOW BAKED MERLU - enjoyed the fish (hake) very much, although I was not a fan of the mussel broth but then I hate mussels to begin with lol I got it for the fish and it was great.CHERMOULA GRILLED BAVETTE STEAK - yum! I especially liked the presentation/colors on this one. The meat might have been cooked slightly more than we wished it to be (medium rare), but I enjoyed it very much with the wine anyway.Dessert:SPICED PLUM - this might have been my least favorite item but it was interesting texture (thought it almost tasted like a fluffy ricecake, if that means anything to you). CHOCOLATE OLIVE OIL GÂTEAU - I loved the presentation of chocolate on the rim of the dish. Very rich flavor but not too heavy chocolate cake and hazelnut icecream!Check pictures for your reference ;)Even after restaurant week, I would definitely visit again (with deeper pocket) and recommend the restaurant to those who want guaranteed-deliciousness with an innovative twist.",1,0,1,Erin K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,68,55
3.0,7/26/2014,"Went to try their restaurant week dinner with 4 other girl friends last night. Would say the dishes were underwhelming overall. No dishes stood out compared to other restaurants at supposedly similar level. The best of the menu we picked was the octopus appetizer with $10 supp. The Ruby Red Shrimp appetizer with $5 supp was hugely disappointing. The shrimps did not taste fresh although I can't say they tasted bad. Probably used frozen shrimp. The texture of the shrimp is just not pleasing. Compare to what we had a week ago in the Spanish tapas restaurant Boqueria, the chef in Boulud Sud should rethink their ingredients and recipe.For 2nd course, 5 of us tried two fished on their restaurant week menu.. The sea bass and Daurade. They are good but not amazingly good. The dessert course is the same. Nothing amazing and don't understand why there will be supp charges for some of them.One bright spot is the Old Fashion I ordered. It was good although I had better.So I think don't go there with high expectation. It's one of those restaurants perhaps restaurant week is good enough. I see no reason to go back there again. On that note, I wonder how many restaurant week participating restaurant realize that bad execution of the restaurant week menu could cause them loss of customers but of course of those foodie customers.",2,0,0,Jennifer H.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,30,35
4.0,7/25/2014,"I came here for dinner before a ballet and if there's one thing I remember from dining there, it's that the Grapefruit Givre dessert (sesame halva, rose loukoum, and grapefruit sorbet) is a must try. It's refreshing, light on the palate, unique, and presented beautifully. The restaurant was very busy when we were there, and almost every table that I noticed was on dessert had at least one order of it. I'm thankful to our dining neighbors who recommended it to us!We ordered from the Restaurant Week dinner menu, which included the Stokes Farm Beet Salad (with almonds, feta cheese, and shallot vinaigrette). I don't think it's on the regular menu right now, which is a shame, because it's the perfect way to start dinner with some greens and thoughtfully paired flavors. The taste of the shallot really comes through in the dressing, and though I normally am not a huge fan of beets, I kept coming back for more in this salad. The portion size was also surprisingly generous.The housemade harissa is also out of this world - it's a very intense herbal flavor that I had a chance to try in both my appetizer and entree.

4.0,6/6/2014,"Well, I was at Boulud Sud a couple of weeks ago, and I had very high expectations due to everything I heard from my chefs friends and from the media. Also when I read the Yelp's reviews I was more excited about going there and taste those amazing dishes as everyone described.So as soon as we got there, we checked the menu, which is very tight, and we all decided to choose the pre-fixe sunday lunch menu, because it looked more interesting to us. The wine and cavas menu had a lot of good options, we chose some champagne, the Daniel brand champagne.I had an arugula and cucumber salad with a nice cucumber dressing, it was a really fresh combination but i got the feeling that something was missing, maybe some additional flavor that made the veggies taste better. After that I had grilled cod fish with a sautéed mixture of capers, tomatoes and potatoes and a little olive paste quenelle, and to give the dish some contrast a lemon foam. It was good, nothing that you could not make at home. Let's be honest, if you are paying some good money, you want something that you don't usually eat and something that you can't prepare at home. So, for me the flavor was good, really nice and tasty but that's it. My friend had the tuscan style hanger steak with wild mushrooms and crushed potatoes, and my other friend had a delicious Spanish egg tortilla, that was my favorite one! It was really tasty, and you can see all the layers of the tortilla very defined, and it came with a red pepper sauce and a bit of greens salad. Desserts were good, definitely not as classical as the main courses, but still missing something to me, they seemed to be kinda empty, I don't know if it was because of my choice of a pre-fixed menu.One thing that I did not like it, was the cold bread! What is it with restaurants serving cold bread?! The whole point about bread is that the cold butter melts into the bread and also that you can chew it properly, we all know that is a little difficult to bite and chew cold and extra hard bread. Other thing that I dont like in general, is when the family meal is served and eaten in the same room than customers, and this happens here. I am not a classist, racist, or anything alike, I am a chef and I know how this works, is just that I think that restaurants always should have a space for their own crew or serve the family meal when there are not customers at the restaurant.Oh! Other thing that is important to know is that you don't need to dress up to go there, you might read that on Yelp but it is not true, the environment is casual, actually, there was a couple in running shoes and there were two tables with kids.I don't think it is expensive, but it is not cheap either.",1,0,1,Daniela H.,"Washington, DC",58,101,347

It had a nice texture contrast of this crisp outside and soft inside. Fire roasted pizza had good flavor too, but I'm not a fan of a soft floppy crust. I wasn't expecting super exceptional pizza here though. Even though my review doesn't sound too positive, yet I still give it 4 stars is because I really liked my dish a lot haha...Usually I haven't been too fond of the past places I've had brunches at before.

2.0,4/15/2014,"Food was tasty but not memorable, and certainly not commensurate with the price. Although the waitstaff was attentive and courteous, our meal was very rushed. It seemed like the goal of the restaurant was to turn over tables as quickly as possible. It's near the Lincoln Center so maybe that's what most people are looking for -- a pre-theater quick dinner. We were not, and the restaurant lost a lot of appeal for that reason. If you're spending around $100/person, you expect an element of luxurious dining, not a Henry Ford assembly line production.Also worth noting, the dining room is open and noisy and not a place for polite conversation between two people. Perhaps better for a group dinner than couples.Bottom line: Food was good but uninspired, service too rushed. Won't be returning.",1,1,0,Michel D.,"Boston, MA",0,13,0

I was seated at a lovely window table overlooking 64th St., which pleased me since, as a single diner, I anticipated getting a less desirable table. Service was efficient and pleasant. I enjoyed a fixed price restaurant week meal which included appetizer, entree and dessert for $25--a real bargain. My fatuoush salad was scrumptious, with hummus hiding underneath the tender shoots of lettuce, radish and other tender veggies. My entree of pasta puttanesca arrived with a dollop of what tasted like fresh ricotta, and I'd asked that the anchovy be withheld and it was . Tiny peeled tomatoes 'garnished' the plate. It was  a deliciously simple dish, filled with capers and an occasional olive. Dessert was the BEST! A rectangular slice of Meyer lemon and pistachio cake with a small scoop of ice cream on the side. The cake was perfect, a combination of tart and sweet and moist and chewy (from the candied pistachios on top). The cake came 'topped' with a thin chocolate wafer across the top of the cake. I wasn't sure what it was or what to do with it, so I picked it up and tasted it...and realized  what it was. Coffee was hot and strong.

3.0,3/4/2014,"Came here for restaurant week for dinner with my bf. Was surprised at how crowded it was for a 9:45 reservation but I guess because it was a Friday and the middle of RW I should have expected it. Anyway, we were seated promptly so I was happy.We ordered the white bean soup and the gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic oil) to start. The soup was terrible. It was bland and there were whole rosemary leaves in the soup which were not pleasant. The shrimp, however, was delicious - perfectly cooked and we wanted to sop up every last drop of the delicious oil with the bread we were served. For our entrees we had the mushroom ravioli and the pimenton skirt steak. The mushroom ravioli was good but nothing outstanding. Also, there was something funny with the texture of the dish - a weird raw onion crunch that I didn't care for. The skirt steak was really tasty and I loved the potatoes - but if you don't like the smoky flavor of paprika I wouldn't recommend it. I should mention that I ordered my steak medium rare and it came to the table very rare so I was a bit disappointed about that.For dessert we had the creme caramel and the chocolate gateaux. Both were good. I liked the chocolate better because I thought there was too much orange in the creme caramel. Overall I felt the meal was a bit hit or miss. Out of the six dishes, I only really liked 3 of them. The others were okay.My bf thinks I should give 4 stars, but it my opinion this place is 3.5 stars.",0,0,0,deanna t.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

It was incredibly soft and tender, and the lentil/kale/sausage stew underneath imparted an aromatic flavor that complemented the fish well.

The first didn't have a very robust flavor and an the accompaniments while tasty were not a good flavor match. The ravioli was too salty and lacked balance...seemed like it was missing a drizzle of nice aged balsamic, or at least a squeeze of lemon. Similarly, it needed more raisins and fewer capers.My buddy had the merlu, which was beautifully cooked and was probably a better choice, though the vegetablesWith it were undercooked an he felt it had too much pesto.

I can only take octopus in small doses usually, and was so impressed with how delicate the flavors were. For the main course, I had the daurade, which was a white fish roasted with a delicious tapenade atop an arugula salad with some tiny potatoes and leeks. All so nice and light. My husband had scallops which were excellent. For dessert, we had the cinnamon gateaux, which had the most amazing green apple sorbet, and the chocolate caramel pot de creme, if I remember correctly!

Here as follows is the real Boulud Sud account:The interior decor smacks of Le Bernardin which is to say appointments are contemporary but not terribly modern. The dining room is pleasantly intimate, which makes those dining opposite the bar rather unfortunate. My fiance could not have enough of the ""From the Fields"" lavender-infused gin cocktail (I plan on learning to replicate it pronto to have on reserve whenever I need a big favor). I had the Embajador and it was wonderfully spicy and intense - I was still buzzed 2 hours post dinner. Our server was very good with a touch of flourish. We put in our orders for apps, main and drinks and we received bread and olive oil plus warm flatbread and beverages within minutes of releasing the menu. Unfortunately the timing between enjoying the light bites were cut short by the arrival of our apps, no more than five minutes later. Not only did the pace feel unnecessarily curt, but the delivery of our plates was not elegant by quite a bit. Happily, that was the only hiccup of the night in which we were celebrating out 5 year anniversary. We had all the time we wanted with the apps (the deeply flavorful soupe de poisson and the refreshing tabbouleh - the pomegranate mix was an inspired co pilot) and a few minutes more until our mains were set down. He had the veal, and I the diver scallops. Neither were particularly adventurous but perfectly executed. The mollusks were tender and just caramelized enough to retain its juiciness while his veal and squash played a lovely duo (the spinach ravioli was a confusing side). Then came the mousse dessert - quite possibly the richest choice of the night and a joy to relish.

That is always a nice touch.The dining room is very pleasant and nicely laid out. Although the website says attire is dressy, there was a wide range of attire, from casual to suit & tie & cocktail dresses.We started with a nice amuse bouche, a crostini with a mint spread and pomegranate seeds. It had a lot more flavor than one would expect. We had some wonderful olive bread and fabulous olive oil. This was fortunate as the flat bread we were also served was somewhat tasteless.Although we had the 3 course price fix dinner, which at $60 is a great value, we had to try the sardine starter. It was wonderful. Not the salty, fishy type you get in many places, but a fresh bite size fish with pickled onions that melted in your mouth and made you wish there were more than 3 pieces to share between the two of us.Our appetizers came shortly thereafter and we were not disappointed. I had the octopus with a wonderful arugula salad, dressed with some olive oil & a light vinegar, some roasted pine nuts and a light creamy cheese that made everything taste special. The octopus was cooked perfectly, slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside as we'll as full of flavor. These starters bode well for the rest of the meal.I forgot to mention the sommelier, he helped confirm for me a great Pinot noir selection - a 2010 Joseph Swan Cuvée de Trois. He explained that the winemaker uses an old world style leaving the stems in for a period of time, which gave our wine a distinct spiciness. It was a perfect match toy loin of lamb with Harissa sauce and my wife's chicken tagine.My lamb was cooked a perfect medium rare and was accompanied by eggplant and fabulous couscous infused with the Harissa spices.My wife's chicken tagine was delivered with the Teepee like cover still on her dish. It looked dramatic when the cover was removed. I had a bite of her dish and the chicken was moist, succulent and well spiced. She liked it so much she saved a piece to bring home and enjoy later.Dessert for me was 3 sorbets, one a chocolate one and was terrific.

However, as someone who is more than happy to pay top-dollar for quality, I'd have to say that the portion size, coupled with the quality of the food (which, again, was excellent, but not life-changing or extraordinary) did not match the especially high price tags.

Even still, apps were delivered before our first round of drinks, and even then we had to ask for the drinks yet again. We were never asked if we'd like a 2nd bottle of wine (we would have).

The service was excellent as they were both friendly and attentive in just the right degree. The dining room feels open and spacious thanks to the gorgeous light that pours in from the huge windows. It would be perfect for an elegant lunch with the parents or something similar. The food was also excellent. Of Daniel Boulud's restaurants I've only been to DBGB so far but my dining experience here at Boulud Sud certainly did not disappoint. The RW menu was delicious and unlike other places it did not feel like they were cutting corners at all. For starters I had the ouzo cured salmon and my friend had the gazpacho. My dish was a gorgeous plate with contrasting textures and wonderful flavors! And even though I'm not usually a fan of gazpacho I really liked my friend's order as well. For our main course my friend had the ricotta cavatelli and I had the pork loin. Both dishes were amazing and we were both very happy. For dessert I had the orange cloud and my friend had the chocolate panna cotta.

5.0,8/30/2013,"We were warmly greeted by the hostess and promptly taken to our seat walking through the crowds of diners filling every seat in the large dining area. It was also our fist time dining on the Upper West Side which had a notably different and older crowd than the one we are use to seeing downtown. The beige paneled walls were covered with photographs inspired by impressionist painters, tables placed close to one another and covered in white linens giving an overall Mediterranean vibe.The menu was broken down into three sections and subsections ranging in Mediterranean flavors from Sardinia, Greece, Tunisia, Morocco to Lebanon: 'From the Garden', 'From the Sea', and 'From the Farm'. The menu favored sharing many of the small plate dishes while ordering one larger entree to share.  The first item that was brought out to us was a complimentary stack of crispy roman style artichoke hearts with a side of creamy aioli dipping sauce. The dish can be found under the subsection portion which includes a variety of Mediterranean mezzes (like the hummus and cauliflower tabbouleh). And while our taste buds were adjusting to the range of textures and flavors we were served one after another amazing plates. Some of the most notables of the night included the steak tartar which was possibly the most exquisite and distinctly Middle Eastern tasting piece of raw meat I've yet to taste.The House-made Greek version of Taramasalata consisted of a smoked cod roe dip served with the most delicious dill covered potato chips. It was a delightful little treat and a great presentation of the traditional Taramasalata. For those who have a soft spot for sea urchins, the Sea Urchin and Crab Tartine should not be missed. Tender pieces of crab topped with sea urchin were served on tiny pieces of rye bread. Next on our list of orders for the night was the Octopus A la Plancha, grilled pieces of octopus served in a bed of almonds and arugula; the Lemon Saffron Linguini and Gambas al Ajillo.From the farm side of the menu we ordered the Arabic Lamb Flatbread and were also served with the Harissa Spiced Beef Tartare. Both were quite exquisite. I guess I'm a big fan of the 'harissa spice' as this dish really did it for me.The best part of the meal had to be the Grapefruit Givre served to us as a complimentary anniversary treat. The icy treat was made with grapefruit sorbet, and a topping of spun sesame halvah. It was so beautiful presented. The flavors were so intricate and so complex. I am certain I will never taste anything quite like it anywhere else.Overall, I could not think of a better place than Boulud Sud to have spent our anniversary. The over the top service and friendly staff, and the amazing culinary experience made for the most perfect evening.

The main dining room was nice however the place looked like it could use a little updating.We had pretty high expectations as we were familiar with Daniel Boulud's reputation and to top it off he was in the kitchen that night. Everything leading up to the dinner was fine we were seated quickly and our server was nice and then the food came...1st CourseGambas Al Ajillo - We had to send them back as the shrimp were not deveined.. I know some people are fine with it and I am not completely opposed to it but...in this case the digestive tract on these shrimps were very dark and thick and we could taste the gritty-ness. Special Crispy Pork Appetizer - Was okay... but not too crispy and expected something that was a bit more exciting than it actually was.2nd CourseZa'atar Spiced Swordfish - The skin crispy while the center of it is a rare. However my fish was cold in the middle. The veg and puree at the bottom of the dish were fine.Suckling Pig - This was really tasty, nice crispy pork skin and succulent meat.  If there was one thing you should try there it would be that.3rd CourseOrange Blossom Cloud - Smelled nice, tasted like hand soap. If Bath & Body Works made a dessert is would be this, in fact if they captured this scent in a bottle I'd probably buy to wash my hands with not eat it.Chocolate Panna Cotta - Caramel, Raspberry Foam, Chocolate Sorbet, could have been fantastic but wasn't.

5.0,8/20/2013,"The dining room is very pricey, so I've never eaten there. But with appetizers and sharing plates starting in the $15-$18 range, I've been perfectly happy hanging out at the pricey bar, which is slightly more affordable. It's a beautiful bar too. This 16-seat island setup is positioned right near the entryway for maximum people watching of the dining room, the busy waitstaff and the bartenders working the bar speedrails packed with bottles of premium booze. The appetizers are not humongous but it's still possible to make an appealing light meal out of one or them, plus a drink. Ingredients, as you'd expect, are incredibly fresh and artfully combined/presented. The one can't miss, must-have item will ""only"" cost $14 -- it's called the Grapefruit Givre and it's served in a hollowed-out grapefruit. The filling is unbelievably complicated and special. Here is how the New York Times described it in its 2-star review:  ""...grapefruit givré, in which a hollowed-out frozen grapefruit is filled with grapefruit sorbet, grapefruit compote, sesame mousse and Turkish delight, then topped with a tuile hat and spun sesame halvah...""To be honest, I found the addition of Turkish delight a bit odd. In the middle of this smooth, dreamy confection, it was jarring to hit pellets of chew-y candy. But overall, I ADORED this dessert. It's enough for a meal.Suggestion: Think about pairing your food and wine. I wanted something that would work with the givre and was served a crisp, nice glass of Greek white.

I was here earlier for lunch and ate on the patio - the experience there was a bit busier/more hectic and I would definitely recommend the dining room. We settled on the prix-fixe menu, which was a good value at around $60 per person. The Octopus A La Plancha was an immediate standout: a unique mix of flavors and delicious octopus. Next, our server suggested I go with the Tuscan Ribeye - I was a bit hesitant, as I don't usually order steak at non-steakhouses, but turned out to be an excellent pick. The favetta with the steak was to-die-for and created a really full, rich set of flavors. The staff walked a good line between being present without being annoying, which can be a tough balance.

I usually don't eat too much bread since I don't like to fill up on it, but I ate my entire share.Andalusian gazpacho (appetizer): I was going to steer away from ordering this since I didn't like gazpacho, but I decided to give it another chance. I'm glad i did, because it was so good! It was served at the perfect temperature (not too cold, but cold enough), and the flavors were bold. That tomato soup really tasted like a tomato.Pork loin (entree): Perfectly cooked. Tender, juicy, not fatty, little succulent piece of pork. It was served atop a white bean salad and puree. I generally don't like beans, but I ate it all (notice a trend here?).Orange blossom cloud (dessert): I ordered this because I was curious. It was... interesting. Kind of tasted like potpourri at first, but then we figured out we should eat it with the ice cream and blackberries. Much better after that. Not sure I'd order it again, but I'm glad I found it what it tasted like.Beef tartar (appetizer): I had only a bite of this, and it was a great little bite. There was a nice spice to it.Salmon (appetizer): Fresh, rare salmon with just the right amount of seasoning.Swordfish (main): Tender. Again, perfectly cooked and flavorful.Chocolate panna cotta (dessert): Rich, high-quality, decadent chocolate. The raspberry sauce was pretty tasty too.Thanks, Boulud Sud!

My group and I ordered food from the RW menu. I ordered: ANDALUSIAN GAZPACHO: This is my first time having gazpacho, so my review on this gazpacho might not be the best. If I had to describe the flavor, it had a strong tomato flavor but at the same time I could taste the seasoning and the lemon added to it. The flavors blended in very well. It's a very tangy soup. I really enjoyed it. ZA'ATAR SPICED SWORDFISH: At first, I wasn't quite sure whether the restaurant had the right order or not. The dish itself looks like chicken. But after eating it, I could tell it's definitely fish. The outside is crispy while the inner parts of the pieces is soft and the very center of it is a little raw. The dish also came with little potato pieces that were nicely season. They were slightly salty and crispy on the outside. HOUSEMADE CRÈMES GLACÉES: I had Dulce De Leche, Strawberry and Grapefruit. The Dulce De Leche tasted somewhat like milk coffee mixed with caramel. The Strawberry was delicious. The Grapefruit flavor was my favorite; it's tangy and sweet at the same time.My boyfriend ordered: SUMMER CHICORY SALAD: I love the vinaigrette they put in this salad! Everything about the salad is good, except for the capers. The capers are too salty. CHARRED BERKSHIRE PORK LOIN: Very tender. The pork is cooked medium and comes with vegetables.

5.0,8/3/2013,"My family went to Boulud Sud (Mediterranean cuisine: Southern France/North African coast; open for 2 years, since mid-2011) on a Friday evening (last night) during summer Restaurant Week.  First, we stopped in at Bar Boulud for a drink (I had a very good flight of 3 Pinot Noirs/Burgundies), and were pleased to see Daniel Boulud himself greeting patrons at the tables and the bar.  By the time we walked around the corner to Boulud Sud for dinner, Daniel already was there, schmoozing with his clientele.  We later discovered, when visiting the rest rooms, that there's a subterranean passageway connecting the two restaurants, accessible to patrons and, of course, the owner. We arrived at 9:20 for our 9:30 p.m. dinner reservation, and were seated by 9:30.  The packed room was not overly loud despite over 100 diners (average age a bit younger, presumably due to Restaurant Week, than what I understand is the usual here) and an open kitchen.  The waitstaff was appropriately attentive - not too much, not too little (except perhaps for a longer-than-expected interim between the main course and dessert; they apologized before we even said anything about it, and it was nice not being rushed).  The four of us shared the Mediterranean mezze from the regular menu, to start - it included probably the best babaghanoush (eggplant) and best lightly oiled flatbread that this Mediterranean-ophilic family ever has tasted, as well as an excellent pea-based hummus, and a very good falafel. An uncharacteristic-for-us second round of the flatbread was mandatory, as we'd become instantly addicted.  Here's what we had:  Me: Andalusian gazpacho with croutons (delicious, although not spicy or chunky, both of which I usually prefer); albacore tuna with caponata and crispy polenta (excellent quality and execution all around); lemon-blackberry gateau with goat cheese and limoncello sorbetti (all flavors and textures melded surprisingly well, even though I'm not a big fan of lemon, and wasn't sure how goat cheese would fit in here - it did)Wife: Watercress, feta, and heirloom watermelon salad (very good); chicken tagine with Moroccan couscous and preserved lemon (the most moist, tender, and flavorful chicken in the history of the civilized world, or very close to it); chocolate sabayon with coffee ganache and gelato (decadently, indulgently delicious)Son: Beef tartare with Gorgonzola (top-notch); tagliatelli pesto (almost perfectly done - a bit salty); gateauDaughter:  The watercress salad; the tuna; the lemon-blackberry gateau The tab for four of us for Restaurant Week menu dinner, including the extra mezze, one Manhattan, one glass of red wine, and three Kronenbourg beers, plus a healthy tip for the excellent service, came to a bit over three hundred dollars.  Well worth it, even if we Long Islanders wouldn't do it every day.  Our son, who's an excellent amateur chef (our twins are 22), said it was one of the couple of best meals he's ever had.  (It's probably in my top 10 - I'm a lot older....)",1,0,0,David A.,"Uniondale, NY",0,18,0

4.0,8/3/2013,"We had a very pleasant and memorable experience at Boulud Sud last night. We had a 7 pm reservation on a Friday night. I fell in love with it the moment I walked into the dining room. It was open, bright, elegant, and vibrant. The service was poised and friendly. We were seated at a table by the big windows. It got our evening off to a good start! The tables were not cramped and chairs/couch were very comfortable. Originally we both wanted to order from the Restaurant Week menu, but my husband was tempted to order a couple of signature dishes a la carte.First off, we were served with a few slices of Focaccia and olive bread. They were both delicious. And then there came a few more thin slices of flatbread (Lavash?), which was so good and reminded me of the Chinese scallion pancake (sans scallion). I told my waiter I loved it, and he immediately offered to bring me more slices.I ordered from the RW dinner menu ($38):1. Heirloom tomato & watermelon salad: it was solid and refreshing.2. Grilled Berkshire pork loin: I asked our waiter about the pork, and he told us that it was the first day the pork was on the menu, and he said he liked it after he'd tasted it. The pork came in 3 slices, and they were unbelievably tender -- non-fatty but not dry. However, the accompanying beans and puree were a bit too salty.3. Chocolate sabayon: this was a twist of the sabayon that I used to know. To be honest, I couldn't tell where the sabayon was hiding, but it tasted divine. It was a cake accompanied with a scoop of gelato and crushed coffee beans. The combination of chocolate and coffee was perfect!My husband ordered a la carte:1. RATATOUILLE AND OEUF MOLLET ($18): a very flavorful dish. The vegetables were not mushy, but still melt in your mouth. It did remind me of our trip to Nice. I ended up trading up my tomato & watermelon salad with my husband for this.2. CHICKEN TAGINE ($29): the waiter made a grand entry for this dish. The portion was not small. I was usually not a fan of tagine/couscous, but I liked this version. They probably had modified it a bit, and it worked! My husband kept raving about the complexity and depth of flavors.As for drinks, my husband ordered a glass of Piaugier blanc from Rhone ($14). I finished up my dessert with a decaf macchiato ($5.5). I have to add that its macchiato was better than most of what I'd had in other restaurants or coffee shops. The foam was so beautiful, and the coffee itself was neither bitter nor burnt nor sour, leaving aromatic aftertaste in my mouth for a long long time. I wonder if I could get it from the Epicerie Boulud around the corner.Our waiter was a friendly young man. He was willing to answer our questions, and I could feel his passion when he talked. I like this kind of feeling and interaction in a formal setting, which made the whole dining experience more personable and less ""stuffy.""Aside from the food and service, another highlight of my dinner here was I spotted Mr. Daniel Boulud in the dining room. He was wearing his chef uniform and talking to the staff. He just breezed through the restaurant for a few seconds and I was glad that I spotted him. I've just read an article about him in a recent issue of New Yorker, and it made me respect him even more. We were so excited that we talked to our waiter about it, and he said Mr. Boulud came here at least once a week. We live in the neighborhood but never came here until yesterday. At first I was not sure about this Mediterranean theme, but now I know I love it. In addition, I love this mature yet still vibrant ambiance. We can't wait to bring visitors here.

4.0,7/24/2013,"If you're thinking about booking Boulud Sud for restaurant week, stop reading this review and make a reservation right now. I just came for the RW lunch and was very impressed. I'm usually not big on RW because the three previous experiences I've had were subpar, but since I loved Daniel so much I decided to give Boulud Sud a try. So glad I did. Best $25 meal I've had in manhattan. For the starter I ordered the Mediterranean mezze which includes hummus, falafels and babaganoush. All three were amazing - I wish I could get a tub of the English pea hummus and put it on every piece of bread I eat. For the entree I debated between the chicken tagine and the flank steak and ultimately went with the tagine in order to relive memories from my recent Morocco trip. The chicken was prepared perfectly. Every bite was tender and flavorful. However, I'm knocking down one star off the review because of the sauce. It was a rather strange flavor that tasted a bit like too much orange rind had been grated in, which was probably due to the preserved lemon. Thankfully it didnt affect the chicken! Though I was pretty full already, I had to try the dessert. Being a chocolate lover I opted for the chocolate sabayon, which was served with a scoop of gelato and simply delightful.

For my entree, I had the seafood risotto. My mother commented that it was sort of like a deconstructed paella. It had a base of ham but had tender fresh green peas distributed around it. Not to mention the fresh head on shrimp and tender non-head on shrimp.    The rest of my family had ""alright"" entrees. The desserts looked tasty, though my family did not have any.

Provencal flatbread--great way to present anchovies. super tasty.Sea urchin and crab--these things i could eat millions of them and they would still be fun to eatOctopus a la plancha--had octopus done this way at blackbird in chicago, and I felt this approach was more successful--tender but not lacking texture. peeled skin. infused with incredible flavor.Chicken Tagine--lovely reminder of morocco and beautiful spice.

4.0,6/23/2013,"If there has ever been a time that I have felt out of place at a restaurant, this would definitely be it! I've been to some pretty swanky places and have a sophisticated palette, but I felt like I was 5 years old rather than 25. The people that dine here are middle aged and wear that suit and tie.Regardless, this had to be one of the better meals I've ever had for this caliber of restaurant [Le Bern is definitely the best]. The service was impeccable minus a misunderstanding between the waiter and myself. However, he more than made up for it as it was partially my fault for not ordering my entree with my appetizer, especially with the kitchen about to close. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and recommended the best dishes when I asked his opinion. I was totally sold on the special appetizer [polenta with chanterelle  mushrooms, a gooey egg in the middle, and shaved white truffle, $19]. The sommelier was quick to our table and recommended a sweet-ish white wine when I told her I was looking at a fish dish to start with [but clearly I was dissuaded by that polenta]. The food was really good. I can't stop raving about the polenta. I wish it was a regular item on the menu. Every bite was more amazing than the last. It was creamy and smooth, the flavors were intense but not overpowering. The chanterelle mushrooms provided texture and the white truffle made it extremely decadent. The gooey egg in the middle, while not needed, made it that more special and delicious. For entree, I had the Manchester Farms Quail [$34]. The quail was wrapped in pancetta and was accompanied by petits pois [english green peas] and more chanterelles. The dish was a bit overkill with a protein wrapped in another protein. At the time I thought I was just being picky, but in retrospect, I feel the same. Everything was cooked well, the flavors were there, it's an outstanding dish for a regular restaurant, but just alright for a Daniel Boulud restaurant. Dessert was also a bit of a miss for me. Strawberry tart with black pepper and strawberry foam [$12-$14]. It was good by ordinary standards but again, not for this kind of restaurant. The tart itself was a little thick and hard to break into. My spoon clanged against the plate [how classy]. I couldn't taste the slightest hint of black pepper which by all means makes this dessert stand out from the crowd. Garnished with gold leaf was a nice touch. Yes, the bill was very expensive.I should mention that we didn't have a reservation and called about 20 minutes before we got there. This was at around 10:45PM and were seated right away.

The Mediterranean flavors in the food really stand out. We started with the taramasalata and the mediterranean mezze which were all rich in flavor and a great start to our meal . The dill potato chips that are served with  the taramasalata were a perfect match to it. Then for appetizers we had the octopus and the rabbit cacciatore it was the best cooked octopus we've had in the city and the flavor of the rabbit was delicious.  At this point we were getting full but still looking forward to our main courses. We ordered the lamb and the rib eye. They were both cooked perfectly and the meat was so tender they both melted in your mouth. The tzatziki that came with the lamb was a perfect accompaniment.  When our waiter asked if we wanted dessert we hesitated but decided what the heck, might as well at this point. He had suggested the grapefruit givré as something light and special to try. Perfect way to finish!

4.0,6/10/2013,"KenScale: 8.5/10Boulud Sud is acclaimed chef Daniel Boulud's take on Mediterranean cuisine across Lincoln Center. It is one of my favorite Mediterranean places in NYC, and I keep coming back here whenever I hang out in the Upper West Side neighborhood. The menu is divided into three sections, ""From the Sea,"" ""From the Garden,"" and ""From the Farm."" I tried a variety of dishes here, and has always been impressed with the consistency of the food always having that Mediterranean delightfulness without being overdressed. For the starter, crispy artichokes and/or octopus a la plancha is a must. Sardine and sheep's milk ricotta are also solid options. For main dishes, go for either chicken tagine or lamb. Saffron linguini is also a dish to consider, either in appetizer or entree portion. Make sure you save room for dessert, as grapefruit givre will absolutely blow you away. Inside a carved grapefruit, you will get to taste grapefruit sorbet and a variety of other delicious treats inside. I wouldn't hesitate to consider this as one of my top 5 desserts in NYC.Given its location across Lincoln Center, Boulud Sud is usually crowded with older crowds looking to check in before or after watching a show or concert. The decor is somewhat muted, but the civilized atmosphere makes this place an ideal restaurant for a date or taking out friends or family visiting from out of town.",2,0,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

While the setting and ambience is quite nice, the service is mediocre.  We were a party of 7 and had cocktails and several bottles of wine, and had to ask the server -- who, by the way, kept changing, as though they wanted to make us guess whom to prod -- to refill the glasses.Appetizers came in a rush, served adequately, but with very little real attention to the finer points of service.   The octopus was adequate, if underwhelming.  The broccoli rabe was neither to die for nor to kill for, but rather something I could have lived without.When the main dishes arrived, their famous chicken dish -- chicken tagine -- was the best thing on the table.  The lamb was well-cooked, but served at room temperature and with no hint of spice or herb...or even salt and pepper.  It was a fine cut of meat, but again, with no attention to the finer aspects of preparation.The other meals received ""ok"" to ""not bad,"" but nobody raved about anything, that's for sure.The service overall was slow -- I'd give it a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  I could not recommend the place, especially not at those prices.We had pizza and beers at patsy's on 74th off Columbus the night before, and, frankly, I would have preferred to dine their again tonight.",0,0,0,Bill F.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,37,0

3.0,5/23/2013,"I had a marvelous time here last night, sitting on the patio with people I just met screening a film at Lincoln Center called Cape Spin. It's really nice and everything is good--unless you don't like Mediterranean food in which case you can stick with the more Continental fish or veggie dishes. I don't like falafels but that appetizer platter has ONE dip I can't describe and in all the commotion, never asked about. But it comes with these crackers and this green dip. That was all right but this other dip and it was not hummus as I cannot stand hummus, whether cheap at Trader Joe's or very expensive at fine dining restaurants was addictive. The fried artichokes: OMG. No words for how fabulous that appetizer is. I don't much like olives so I didn't like the sourdough with olives but the focaccia was all right. Ratatoille is the least expensive entree for 21 and that looked good. Service is bad. I can't deny this, so if you're looking for an efficient meal before a show, this ain't the place. I could use the more charitable term, ""leisurely,"" but seriously, our server was nice but terrible. We had to ask for menus multiple times and when we did it was as though we never had asked in the first place. In fairness, I have heard the service on the patio is FAR worse than inside where they manage pretty well. The outside is ridiculously slowVodka gibson outstanding but pathetically tiny and overpriced. I mean it was HALF a drink at most. For the money, there are a dozen places at least in Manhattan's UES or UWS I would choose before this. But next time, I would eat in the gorgeous dining room rather than the patio. It's worth the money just to sit in that beautiful environment and I might go for a drink later this trip. Bar Boulud is not cheaper as I assumed. I figured it was the bistro version. I adore the Epicerie hot dogs and always have one before movies at Lincoln Plaza (twice in a week I saw the Diana Vreeland documentary last fall) Recommend the Au Bon Climat white they served last night. I didn't see the wine list so I have no idea how much it was. In NYC always better with a friend to order a bottle as wines by the glass are significantly higher than in LA or other major cities. The manager at 67 Wine told me his friends in the business have a theory about wines by the glass in NYC Basically, you can charge anything you want because it's ""just a glass.""If it were not so expensive with such tiny cocktails and bad service, I would still give it a 4.

As for the food ...The bread basket (focaccia, olive loaf) is simple yet exciting, and the olive oil served alongside is unbeatable - grassy and exploding with fruit flavor. Mezze platter (falafel, baba ghanoush, hummus) is clean and well-executed but not exactly thrilling, especially for the UWS, which is almost a Mideast culinary mecca, if you will. Chicken tagine is superbly seasoned but a touch overcooked, though certainly not dry.Scallops are world-class - featherweight, melt-in-your-mouth orbs of ocean.Dorade (fish) is wonderfully oily and full of rich flavor, almost like mackerel, and the skin is a revelation - somehow barely browned yet crisp as a cracker.

3.0,3/3/2013,"I went to Boulud Sud with my family last night for the pre-theatre dinner prix fixe menu. The restaurant had great ambiance and filled up quickly by 6:00, presumably with others dressed up for the theatre. The meal began with olive bread (tasty) and focaccia (cold, bland). My father and I each ordered a glass of wine, which was my favorite part of the meal. With the cheapest wine at $13 a glass, you can't go wrong. The rest of the meal was such a disappointment. The appetizer - a Mediterranean mezzo - consisted of hummus, baba ganoush, and falafel. It was not special at all. The falafel had a strange consistency and the crisps were bland. My entree was the real disaster, though: butternut squash ratatouille that was heavily salted and weakly spiced. Tasted like chopped up squash, onion, and canned tomato. The worst part was that the dish came with a ""hen's egg"" in the middle - and it was RAW. I called the waiter over and pointed this out, and he apologized, saying it was supposed to be soft boiled. Mind you, I love runny yolks. But gelatinous, mucous-y whites? Gag me. He took it back and brought me another plate without the egg -- but it just wasn't good enough to eat more. For sides, we ordered the (bland, absurdly priced) smashed potato and the chickpea fritters, which were interesting but ultimately too far removed from actually resembling chickpeas to be satisfying. The fritters were fried blocks that had a mousse-like and spongy texture, and tasted nothing like chickpeas. Just weird. My mother had the cod and didn't like it, my brother had the chicken tagine and said it was awful, and my dad ate his orecchiette with duck but that doesn't say much as he'll eat anything. Dessert was so-so as well. The bill for 4 three-course prix fixe meals plus 2 sides and 2 glasses of wine was over $300 without tip. What a ripoff. The only way I'd ever go back would be if they refunded me for that disappointment of a meal that I was barely able to eat.Update 4/3/2013: Wrote Boulud Sud a letter, and they were appropriately upset with our experience at the restaurant. They sent a sizable gift card and asked us to call beforehand for our next visit, presumably so that we will get the special treatment.

3.0,1/21/2013,"This is definitely over rated food and overpriced for the quality of the food. The restaurant has a Mediterranean theme and lot of the dishes are derived from what you will find in south of France and Spain/Moroccan, but they are sometime just a pale imitation. We had the soupe de poisson which was very average. It was refined and was trying too hard to be like a veloute and missed the mark. It was far remote from what a soupe de poisson should be, a bit coarser, with a spicier rouille, more varieties of fish. We also had octopus  a la plancha which was actually pretty good. We ordered a couple of tapas, jamon and tabouli. I thought the Jamon was good but not served well, not enough serving and cut too fine. It should have been served with real bread as opposed to toasted baguette. The tabouli was too dry for my taste, where did the olive oil go? We also had the Loup de mer, daurade and scallops. De loup was good but way overpriced. We ordered the wild mushroom side dishes which actually had very few mushrooms but was mostly made of quinoa cooked in an overly buttery sauce.The food was good, but way too expensive for the quality we got.

Same with the lamb, which was cooked to order (mine was medium, it came to me medium, and was perfect)  The Salad Tropezienne, and all the sides we ordered to put on the table showcased our main meals nicely.    All of the items ordered (we had a chocolate mint dessert  that is no longer on the menu.

Great place for a flavorful but lighter meal. Two friends and I shared an assortment of dishes. The Octopus was a stand-out for me, as it was warm with a touch of crisp-saltiness rather than the standard cold or rubbery kind. We also enjoyed the Greek salad, spaghetti squash (delicious), and the pappardelle (as expected, but still good). Also, although there are no vegetarian entree choices on the standard menu, they did have a veg special and there are plenty of small plates  to choose from. The wine list is extensive and there are a few budget-friendly bottles on there to choose from, which was appreciated. They could stand to add a few more.

Came here for their pre-theatre prix fixe menu and we were quite pleased.For $60pp, it was quite reasonable with the amount of food and the complexity of each dish that was served. We both started with drinks, a beer and one of their signature cocktails, and ordered from start to finish with the waitress. I was taking my bf to see a surprise show afterwards and the waitress almost blew up my spot by asking whether we had a show to see. Not her fault since we were eating the pre-theatre dinner, but for anyone doing something similar, perhaps you should tell them on the sly or on your OpenTable reservation. And while the food didn't blow our minds, it was delicious all the same. The restaurant is Mediterranean but there were definitely French influences throughout. We sat right by the kitchen (open kitchen) so it could be a bit noisy at times, but it was interesting watching them expedite and seeing all the different dishes leaving the kitchen.I'd recommend the pre-theater dinner if you're on the fence.

Ordered from the prix fixe lunch menu- 2 course for $29. Started with cauliflower soup and a hanger steak entree. The cauliflower soup came out lukewarm and the portion is tiny. the pomegranate seed that came with the soup didn't add any positive note. Since the seed is hard, it did not complement the soup. I actually couldn't taste any cauliflower but curry powder instead. As for the steak, I ordered medium rare, and it came precut into tiny pieces and every piece was cooked in different temperature...some were well done, some were raw, some were medium and some were medium rare. it's honestly not that hard to cook a steak and the kitchen managed to screw it up. For dessert, I had the Mediterranean sweets (Pistachio Baklava, Hazelnut Torrone, Chocolate Panforte Di Siena). The torrone was so chewy in a bad way while the chocolate was inedibly bitter.

Boulud Sud defines itself Mediterranean cuisine. However, when having the food, I felt some of French elements inside. (French is the part of Mediterranean.. sort of ...) The restaurant is well-balanced among the food, the decor and the service, and I would recommend Pre-theater menu here before any concert or performance at Lincoln Center. You will be satisfied both with the taste and music! (Otherwise, a bit pricey, over $100 with one drink...)Food: 3.5 Good overall. I was not actually fond of Chicken liver mousse, a little too sour for my taste. On the other hand, I usually do not like grilled octopus so much but here I loved it. Because of Mediterranean flavor characteristic, I would suggest to select items from the menu carefully and find out your favorite dishes!My favorite 11/27 NIMAN RANCH BEEF DUO Parsnip, Black Trumpet, Sauce BordelaiseOCTOPUS A LA PLANCHA Marcona Almond, Arugula, Jerez VinegaService: 4.0 Great! the servers were very professional and attentive.

4.0,12/1/2012,"I think I prefer Bar Boulud around the corner - more casual. As the Yelp stats correctly claim, this is an upscale and classy joint. There's a good chance you will be the youngest person in the restaurant. I think we were, and we aren't actually that young. The menu is Mediterranean themed and divided into sea, garden, and meat (or 'farm'). I found the menu a tad overwhelming as it is basically three different menus - each with small plates to share, proper appetizers, and then entrees. I was kind of hoping for a tasting menu so I wouldn't have to decide. Highlights for us: uni and crab dish. The grilled octopus was brilliant. The ham dish was nice and featured a crazy tomato. Since its 2012, they had a kale salad that was tops of the pop. My lovely wife adored the chicken liver (I'm not a fan). The whole fish looked amazing, but we didn't get it. The wine list, as expected, is very well curated. I lost a good five minutes exploring it. High-end professional staff. Their payroll is huge - you'll notice a lot of people working here. Dress code? We were on a Friday night and I may have been one of maybe three people who were wearing jeans (nice jeans, but jeans). If I came back, I would leave my suit on from work and lose the tie. It's upscale UWS. Great spot for date night. Or visiting parents. Or a meal with clients. Or a meal with your obviously way younger mistress. It's pricey, but you knew that.

And oddly enough, the dessert on the neighbor's table also looked quite commonplace - a grapefruit in a bucket of ice, reminiscent of Costco's frozen fruit treats.At the end of it all, we consoled ourselves by going next door to Boulud's Epicerie.

The usual rubberiness of octopus was not there and the seasoning was just right. I wish the plate had been bigger. My dining partner inauspiciously said, as the octopus was taken away, that the small plates are the best here. Very speedily (the service was excellent) came our mains: I took the swordfish with Moroccan spice, and my dining partner took the divers scallops. The swordfish was the most tender I have eaten and the flavors were nicely balanced. However, it was lacking the taste of swordfish, where it really counts. I had a scallop, which was even more tasteless. It was cooked to perfection, but a bit boring. I go to a restaurant to have food I a simply not skilled enough to cook. Those scallops, with a little trial and error, I could have done - and maybe better. Dessert was some sort of chocolate ravioli. A crepe-based take on ravioli, with chocolate oozing out.

Chef Boulud steps away from classic French and attempts Mediterranean quite exceptionally.  Came here for dinner when it first opened last fall and had an overall flawless experience. Gorgeous bar area but on a side note: I am really not a fan of the interior. Who chose this senior citizen retirement home-type decor? The dreary color combo, wall art, and furniture remind me either of an old folk's home or cheap continental breakfast at a lower-level chain hotel. Our waiter was attentive and extremely knowledgable about the menu.  All the small plates and appetizers I tried thanks to his recommendation were well-balanced and full of flavor (highly recommend: Sea Urchin & Crab Tartine, also the Octopus a la Plancha).Boulud Sud serves one of my top favorite entrees in NYC to date--THE LAMB!!!  Spiced Colorado Lamb Loin with M'Hamsa, Algerian Eggplant, Yogurt.

I have to be honest with you, the Upper West Sideness is rich in this one. First if you go there before 7:00pm to sit at the main dining area, you HAVE to order a prefix course of $60/person. So, we sat on the bar area. The servers at first didn't come for 10 minutes, but after they were very attentive in their wine refilling and ""is everything fine""-ness. We got a bottle of their 2010 Greek wine, $50, for 3 of us. Wine was decent. Definitely wasn't worth $50.00. Then, we got their lamb, pasta and octopus dish: $41, $30, $28 respectively. They were all TINY portions. But, the taste was in fact exquisite. They gave us some really typical focaccia bread and pita slices with mild olive oil. I was not impressed. The food, yes, great flavors, rich taste. But, the blatant high prices, the ""I can afford to over pay"" atmosphere is not my thing.

Since the reservation was for 5:30 p.m., it was still light outside thus the ambiance was a bit lacking since it seemed like we're in a cafeteria.Since we finished our lunch at Brasserie 8 1/2 at around 3:00 p.m., we weren't very hungry and decided to go light on the entree. For appetizers, we had the manila clams, sea urchin & crab tartine, hamachi crudo, octopus a la plancha, Mediterranean fish soup, shrimp al ajillo, chickpea & eggplant (herb falafel, pea hummus, babaganoush, and lavash), and olive oil crushed potatoes with garlic chips. For entree, we had the Maine diver scallops and the special grilled lobster.The clams, sea urchin & crab tartine, and octopus were tasty and I would order again. The fish soup was ok but others in my group thought it was too heavily seasoned. The pea hummus and babaganoush were delicious especially with the Mediterranean flatbread that was offered in the restaurant. The best tasting and best bargain would be the shrimp al ajillo for $19. There were 3 Spot Prawns, not merely shrimp. Perfectly cooked and seasoned (with some roes inside too). The spot prawns at a market in LA the week prior was $22 per pound, so $19 for 3 prawns was a steal. Next time, I will order one and not going to share :)The scallops was good and the baby peas had the right tartness to showcase the scallops. The special of the day grilled lobster was perfectly cooked and seasoned with roasted root vegetables and cilantro paste which was very pungent and perfect for the lobster.Although we were stuffed, we had to order dessert as dessert technically will go to a special stomach. We ordered the mediterranean sweets - baklava, hazelnut torrone, and chocolate panforte di sienna, and one other dessert which I forgot what it was. The baklava and torrone were good but the chocolate panforte was too heavily spiced we left most uneaten.Service from the support staff was excellent. Service from the waiter was good but got a feeling that he wasn't too happy we only ordered 2 main courses for 4 (although one member of the party was feeling sick and pretty much just sat there and drank her Coke and ate the baklava).

My recent first-time meal here with three friends left us shaking our heads and hungry two hours later. The courses are ridiculously too small for these prices, and I'm a skinny, light eater.There were too many things wrong with this experience to write about. And given that I think Boulud is a genius, I hate writing these less-than-praiseful words.Chef Aaron Chambers may be Boulud's biggest mistake. Of all the individual items we ordered, the only stand out dish was the Charred Niman Ranch Rib Eye. It was delicious, but the steak was the smallest piece of meat I had ever experienced. IMO, at these prices, for such tiny portions, every bite should be a flavor sensation. The rib eye was the only thrill.The desserts didn't impress either. I love grapefruit but the famous Givre was too sweet. The Plum Linzer featured an aspic layer that reminded me of the Alien movies. A silly, tasteless addition.The room is large and seems cold, in spite of the warm colors. The restaurant feels like an institution of chain restaurants, something you might expect across the street from Lincoln Center. The patrons looked and dressed like tourists.We had an experienced waiter who appeared to lack patience and strained to be hospitable. When he didn't recommend dishes that we were hoping to enjoy, our table of four knew there might be trouble. When our waiter sensed our hesitation with the dishes he was suggesting, he instantly changed his attitude and became one of those ""everything is fabulous"" boobs.When we left, after spending over $700, nobody at the door thanked us for coming or asked us how we enjoyed ourselves.IMO, dining at Boulud Sud was an expensive mistake.

I returned it and asked for a substitute which was a pile of aurugula with some orange wedges and crumbled walnuts.  Not bad, but not what one would expect in this price category.  Main course was a fish dish, smallish, but well prepared.  Desserts are only ones in the top star rating category and far above the rest of the meal. Our waitress was obviously inexperienced, but well-meaning, which was of some help.  We had two apperitivos: a sort-of prosecco and a Lillet cocktail $14 and $15 respectively.  Coffee is $5 a cup.Ambiance is casual elegant and the decor is superb.  All in all too much $ for what is given.",0,0,0,Agnes F.,"New York, NY",2,39,0

In addition, he recommended an amazing starter - the rabbit riette.  The veal and the lamb that he recommended were excellent. My wife had a very heirloom tomato starter which also was fantastic.

5.0,7/11/2012,"Boulud Sud was my first ultra-fancy dinner since I moved here, and it was certainly not a disappointment, in any way. I am so into Daniel Boulud, even his name sounds so classy and elegant, and ever since I had read about Boulud Sud in New York Magazine before I lived here I was dying to try it. So when a good friend came to visit for her birthday, and I had to get up early the next day and wanted to stay in the neighborhood, I chose it for her special dinner. And it lived up to expectations in every way.First off the atmosphere was classy, elegant, and quiet enough that you could easily have a conversation. The tables were far enough apart that you could ogle what the people at the next table ordered, but didn't feel like you were participating in their conversation. It's hard to see inside from the sidewalk but now that I know what the bar is like I would definitely come back for a casual drink and a snack and sit at the bar, it is really nice.The service was excellent - our waiter was there at the right times, not there when he shouldn't be, and made great recommendations both for food and wine. I especially loved the glass of Rose I had with my entree. And the food was definitely in the top three meals I have ever had. We had a beef carpaccio to start that was incredible. It came with an egg yolk confit (I had to look that up on the menu, WTF, who even thinks of that) and chanterelle mushrooms. Every bite was amazing. I was so sad when it was gone. We also had a shrimp dish which was delicious but not as ethereal as the beef. For my main course I had scallops. They were cooked just right and the combination of flavors totally blew my mind. They had this nice spice mixture on them, it was incredible. And since there was a birthday happening we had to get dessert. I had the Goat Yogurt Cloud and it was insane, in a really good way. It was basically like a scoop of ice cream, with cookie crumbles and apricots, topped with a chocolate dome, and presented by having a nice waiter type pouring warm chocolate sauce over it to melt the dome and have everything mix together into an awesome mess. WHOA. I needed to find my mama and give her a good slap for that one, unfortunately (well, fortunately for her), she lives 1600 miles away. Thank you, Mr. Boulud, for an incredible experience, I cannot wait to try your other restaurants.

At all.I would come back for before or after theater drinks and maybe a small bite at the bar.  But dinner here just isn't worth it anymore.  With all the other positives going for this place, it's probably more of a 3.5 stars, but can't round up for a restaurant where food is the disappointment.",1,0,0,Marina D.,"Manhattan, NY",5,52,0

4.0,7/3/2012,"I'm withholding a fifth star for three reasons:1. Daniel Boulud doesn't care about red wine. This restaurant, like his others, serves them too warm.2. The bartenders seem overwhelmed. I think they need three for a restaurant of this size, not two.3. I saw a bartender pour the remainder of a bottle of the $26 per glass champagne into another bottle. I don't know why two bottles were open but this isn't ketchup. Again, I don't think Boulud cares that much about wine.Aside from that, terrific food!

White meat only!! dark meat lovers do not order. (I was deciding between this and another entree and the Egyptian waiter told me this was a must! His Middle Eastern expertise was spot on!)I can't remember the exact dessert I had but it consisted of chocolate and pomegranate. I love chocolate paired with fruit! It had a sweet and sour taste to it and was very unique!The bar is pretty extensive and they have a large wine list. The bar is small but quaint.

I am so glad that we came across this place; it was fantastic.The thing that really made the experience for me was the service. It went over and above what I would expect from a high-end restaurant, certainly better than what one would expect in London, for example. The food was also very good, with the dessert being a particular highlight.The prices were very reasonable, particularly the prix fixe menu. Three courses were around $50-60, which for a restaurant of this quality was excellent. We ordered Cava at approx. $60 per bottle - I felt that this was very good value even though the wine itself was nothing to write home about. The digestif selection could also be improved, but these are minor criticisms.The decor is bright and modern, not particularly romantic but perfect for a pre-theatre dinner.

5.0,6/1/2012,"I've always wanted to try one of Daniel Boulud's restaurants, in particular, his eponymous one with all those Michelin stars, but I was intimidated by the price point and the fact that you have to know months in advance when you are dining there. Besides, I'm not a gourmand when it comes to French cuisine since I don't like Jerry Lewis and I'm not into bland dishes with heavy sauces or liberal sprinklings of herbes de Provence. That's why I was thrilled to hear that his latest venture, just a year old, focuses on Mediterranean fare - spicier food that more likely fits within the strict confines of my ""flexitarian"" diet (i.e., minimizing meat and focusing more on plant-based ingredients). Conveniently located across Broadway from Lincoln Center, it sits across from his popular Bar Boulud.An Open Table reservation a week in advance got us a preferred window table where we saw the comings and goings of Upper West Siders. The obligatory bread plate came by with an assortment of foccacia and wheatberry complemented by a buttery concoction infused with spring peas and a shallow pool of olive oil with a garlic sliver and a few rosemary leaves. Gone in sixty seconds... ok, maybe ninety. Given our recent predilection for hummus, Jamie W. and I immediately ordered the first item off their ""To Share"" a la carte menu - the $15 Chickpea & Eggplant plate with herbed falafel, spring pea hummus, babaganoush and lavash. Was it better than anything you can get at the Hummus Kitchen? Dunno. It certainly was fresh and beautifully presented (see photos) with the lavash constantly replenished.From there, we took advantage of their remarkable deal - a three-course lunch for $28 available Monday through Friday - remarkable at least by Boulud's lofty standards. We both started with the Spring Market Salad, a bounty of grilled vegetables (mostly wilted greens, asparagus, shallots and artichokes) with shavings of parmigiana reggiano and a sherry vinaigrette dressing (see photo). Tasty, toothy goodness. Jamie took the higher road on his entree and had the Pan Roasted Skate Wing with cippolini onions, ruby potatoes and dill. Just charred oh-so-slightly with the fish perfectly tender. Lovely. Mine was an earthier choice for a semi-retired carnivore - the Tuscan Style Hanger Steak with wild mushrooms, taggiasca olives, fava beans and crushed potatoes complete with a blackened lemon half (see photo). Of course it was excellent - hearty and tender slices of beef with a definite Italianate flair.The desserts were masterfully presented as a culinary crescendo to our symphony of a meal (...hey, I'm sitting near Lincoln Center). The Berry-Pistachio Coupe was the more modest of the two with a deep stemless goblet covered at the bottom in a lemon crémeux and lightly sprinkled with a pistachio crumble (see photo). I recommend this one for anyone favoring a citrusy mousse to cleanse the palate. Jamie went for the more decadent Hazelnut Mandarin Entremet, quite a showpiece with a crousillant praline, milk chocolate mousse, mandarin crémeux, and chocolate sorbet all artfully arranged on the narrow plate (see photo). Seriously, need you ask how good that was. The executive chef here is not Boulud (who apparently has become a conglomerate) but Aaron Chambers whose star I see rising quite precipitously on the Manhattan dining scene.FOOD - 5 stars...masterful executions of Mediterranean-inspired dishes...and the $28 prix fixe lunch is a relative steal for a Boulud operationAMBIANCE - 4 stars...very Upper WestSERVICE - 4.5 stars...attentive and informedTOTAL - 5 stars...bargain Boulud...awesome for the price",8,4,7,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

Regardless of the price, the octopus was excellent.  My entree was the grilled quail stuffed with spinach and farro - first time I ever had quail and can understand why it's always being served in a Henry James or Edith Wharton novel (the bird is obscenely small, almost like a fetus, but I digress).  My dessert was some sort of pomegranate sorbet, very refreshing.The atmosphere is interesting, not high end in the grand manner, but still classy, modern and bright and a little antispetic, but the staff was very warm and inviting - theres an open kitchen concept and you can see the chefs at work if you are sitting on that side of the dining-room, we were over by the windows.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area and are torn about where to go before the theatre - we made reservations a week in advance just to be on the safe side.",0,0,0,Marcus D.,"Boston, MA",40,668,0

4.0,3/31/2012,"I came here with companions before going to see ballet at Lincoln Theatre and got the pre fixe dinner. The pre fixe comes with numerous option all of which are Mediterranean inspired as this is a Mediterranean restaurant. Don't expect a traditional one at that. The service is very attentive and friendly. Everything was efficient and timely. The first thing you receive aside from menus is a wonderful bread assortment of focaccia, pita bread, and a Moroccan (if I do recall accurately) flat bread. The focaccia I felt was alright, a bit dry and dull in comparison to the flat bread. The pita bread was pretty standard and served as a good mop for sauces and things. The Moroccan flat bread was the stand out amongst the trio of breads, it was flaky, warm, and rustic. It was a layered crisp bread, and was fantastic alone. The breads come with a roasted pepper dip and a plate containing sea salt and rosemary in which a fruity olive oil from Spain is poured. For my starter course I ordered the Octopus alla Plancha (3 supplementary), while it added to the bill it was completely worth it. One of my dinner companions order the Onion Veloute, while the other ordered the Spring Salad. The Onion Veloute is an onion soup with incredible flavor that cannot be described in other words. The flavors are distinct, yet one cannot pinpoint exactly what flavors are represented in the dish. One can only say, or at least I could only tell you that it was delicious. The Spring Salad consisted of fresh crisp greens with sweet grape tomatoes and crispy pancetta strips. Flavor-wise it was pretty ordinary, but if you are addicted to fresh delicious vegetables this is the dish for you. The Octopus all Plancha was my favorite dish of the night. It consisted of grilled octopus, fresh bitter arugula, crunchy pickled onions, a white bean puree, and crunchy Marcona almonds. While the combination may seem overwhelming when combined in a dish the flavors are so profound and interesting. There is the element of tart, salty, nutty, and sweet. The octopus, which is incredibly difficult to cook well was cooked to perfection and was tender and buttery. The almonds were toasted and provided a great textural contrast to the softness of the octopus and the white bean. The white bean was creamy and smooth. This dish was so good that it had me smiling between bites. For the main course I ordered the Grilled Quail with mushroom farro. My companions both ordered the Chicken Tagine. The Chicken Tagine had a strong taste of preserved lemon, white wine, and spices. The chicken itself had a nicely crisped exterior and was served with turnips and carrots. For those of you who like tagine, order this. The Grilled Quail was cooked medium, so that when you cut into the delicate bird the interior was a light pink. I don't know about any of you, but I prefer my bird cooked pretty well through. I must say the exterior was nicely crisped. The quail was stuffed with spinach, peppers, and nuts  I believe. Served atop of the bird was salsa verde. The salsa verde was tangy and zippy, adding a nice flavor contrast. The mushroom farro was by far my favorite part of the dish. The farro was incredibly nutty and cooked perfectly so that the grains maintained some ""bite,"" as chefs often say. The mushrooms were woodsy and incredibly flavorful. Next time though I'll skip the quail and order the Papperdelle. For dessert I opted for the Chocolate Pomegranate Tart, which is oddly enough not very tartly at all. It consists of a strip of thick dark chocolate that has the consistency of ganache. Resting atop of said chocolate is pomegranate sorbet. Scattered around are drops of chocolate cream and pomegranate seeds. The richness of the chocolate is nicely cut by the tart refreshing sorbet. One of my companions ordered the Chocolate Casatta, which is a chocolate sacher torte topped with whipped cream and a spiced orange. The other ordered the Gianduja Parfait, which was not reminiscent of a parfait at all, perhaps more of deconstructed parfait? For desserts I would recommend the Chocolate Pomegranate Tart. Perhaps next time I shall order the cheese platter. All of the food here is beautiful in appearance. I hope to come again and try their regular menu.",1,0,0,Melanie T.,"Manhattan, NY",27,339,233
3.0,3/23/2012,"I came here for dinner with a fellow foodie friend I don't get the chance to see very often.  We had both heard great things so decided to check it out for a weekday dinner.Starting off, the staff was very accommodating and friendly.  We grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar until our table was ready (I was late for the reservation, oops) and they were delicious!  Granted, the drink menu was still based on Winter items though the day before and the weather now indicates it's Spring!  Seated at the table, I noticed the decor reminded me a bit of an airline lounge.  While it was comfortable, I didn't find it to be exceptionally beautiful.  The feel of it was nice, light and airy though.  The crowd also seemed quite elderly around 8:00 PM on a Thursday night.As excited as we were for the food, we found most of it to be hit or miss.  There's no denying the quality and freshness of the ingredients - there just seemed to be a total lack of seasoning on most of the proteins that made the experience sadly bland :(  First course was a citrus cured fluke and the sea urchin and crab tartine.  The tartine was delicious and rich, the fluke tasted like... nothing. The only citrus flavor I got was in the small pieces of actual citrus fruit used as garnish and the raw carrots did absolutely nothing to add to the dish.  Next course - grilled squid and wild boar tagliatelle appetizers.  The grilled squid on its own was wonderfully charred with great flavor.  A few accompaniments on the plate were strange to me, especially the weird texture of the avocado blobs.  The tagliatelle pasta was good and cooked well, nothing remarkable.  Mains - disappointed and sad.  Seared diver scallops and the baked cod.  My scallops were a wonderful size and perfectly cooked, they just lacked any seasoning whatsoever.  A pinch of salt would have made a world of difference.  The lettuces on the plate were better seasoned than the protein!  The cod was equally bland.  We were very disappointed and sad.  Desserts - pistachio creme brulee and the grapefruit givre.  Both good though a little perplexing.  The best thing was probably the grapefruit sorbet - refreshing and tart!All in all, we both agreed we'd probably not return.  While the food quality was great, there are so many places in NY that serve amazing ingredients in an amazing way.  The hit or miss places don't make the cut.  However, I want to note that the server was very attentive and friendly and our water glasses were never empty, empty plates were promptly taken away, and the place is quite pleasant to try at least once.",0,0,0,Alexa H.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

I imagine the dining room (nothing too special; bright, open kitchen) nightly sees a mishmash of professional gatherings, celebratory dinners, groups eating off each others' plates, and low-key dates. We chose to nix the mains ($20-$30) in favor of sampling several small plates ($10-$20). The clear winner to my mind was the tangy, almond-sweetened octopus; honorable mentions to the veal-stuffed tortellini special. The grilled shrimp also set a number of regional hues to creative advantage - blood orange, giant, mealy beans, and big, pink shrimp convened to create a postcard-perfect Mediterranean plate.The sweetbreads and the ratatouille were a simplistically French cop-out; heavy-handed, predictable, and unoriginal. (Skip 'em). I need to give a shout to the dessert - a silk-smooth, pistachio-themed flan, accented with strong exotic citrus syrups and sorbets.

4.0,2/27/2012,"I went here for dinner last night. The restaurant feels really clean and airy, but I don't think it felt intimate. The lights seemed really bright for dinner. Luckily, it was a friend-date, not a date-date.We got a plate to share - something about oranges and risotto and a tiny bit of cheese, deep fried. Fun, tasty little option. Plus, fried cheese balls, am I right?My appetizer was the Pappardelle Con Cinghiale, which had the most perfect pasta I've ever had. It had a bit too much cheese for me, but the meat was tender and perfectly prepared, along with the choice of vegetables. It was just a great blend.My date had the Moroccan Spiced Sweet Potato Soup and wouldn't shut up about how great it was. I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, so I skipped it, but he pretty much wanted to lick the bowl.My main was the Maine Sea Diver Scallops. They were PERFECT. The grilled scallops were on top of polenta and littered with hazelnuts, oils and herbs. Plus - I'm a huge fan of brussel sprouts and was incredibly surprised to find grilled sprouts on the plate as well.  Overall, spectacular. Would order again.My date had the Spiced Niman Ranch Lamb Loin. The lamb was beautiful and the spiced sauce/paste that accompanied it was on the side, so you could season to taste. We got the sorbet/ice cream sampler for dessert - grapefruit, coffee and almond ice cream. The Almond was easily the best of the three. The coffee was really strong, but if you enjoy coffee as much as I do, that's a good thing. I was kind of meh on the grapefruit. It was well done, and had a slight cream flavor to it (in the same family of an orange creamsicle). It was interesting, but that's only good for one bite, really.The ladies room was a little ghetto, with paper signs on the back of the doors. The private dining area seemed really nice - I walked through on my way to the ladies room, and they were set for an event. Small, but really intimate and the ambiance in the basement was so romantic. That sounds ridiculous, I know, but I felt like I was walking through a candlelit hallway in a French mansion.Overall, I really enjoyed this meal. I think the lighting made the evening feel more like a business meeting than a date. The plates were beautiful and tasty, but wasn't knock-your-socks-off- or write-home-to-mom-  good.",0,0,0,Kate J.,"Manhattan, NY",12,15,1
4.0,2/21/2012,"Love the atmosphere here. It feel casual, yet the green-tinted glasses and sunny interior make me feel as though I'm in some classy resort along the Mediterranean. Came here twice for restaurant week. The bread plate changes, but tends to consist of focaccia and either pita or olive bread. Once you finish it the waiter asks if you'd like more, so be careful or you'll become full from eating bread before your food arrives.The chickpea soup on the menu was delicious. Quite heavy for an appetizer, but I loved the crunch of the actual whole chickpeas that garnished the soup. The charred salmon with farro was a lighter choice, but although the flavors were more delicate I think the textures (chewy farro and tender salmon) worked beautifully. Lamb merguez was on the heavier, greasier side and was spicier than expected, but I liked it. The skate was a bit tastier, but I'm not a huge fan of olives so I ended up giving half of it to my boyfriend. Dessert --- the grapefruit dessert is light and refreshing, as is the lemon one (depends on the week, I suppose) -- much preferred them over the chocolate-pomegranate tart. Check out the bathroom when you're either here on at Bar Boulud. There's a nice wine cellar next to them and a path that connects the two restaurants.",2,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",240,816,249

It's listed as an appetizer, and the serving size may look small, but its flavors are so unbelievably rich, it could easily satisfy as an entree.If you want something crunchy, try the crispy fried and breaded artichokes, served with aoli dipping sauce, and presented like a beautiful Calder sculpture.The sheep's milk and olive tapenade dish was was tasty, but oddly it did not come with its own bread. Remember to ask for more of the complimentary table bread, because there's a lot to spread here.

4.0,2/6/2012,"I have been here twice for brunch but never for dinner so my review will focus only on brunch. I really enjoyed this restaurant overall, definitely as good if not better than Bar Boulud right next door, but it's difficult to compare since they're different styles of cuisine. The Mediterranean style of Boulud Sud was definitely different and interesting but I'm not sure if I'm completely sold on it. The decor of Boulud Sud is very nice, this being a new restaurant the style is very modern. They have a few beers there that can't be found anywhere else in the city and they are amazing, but I have already forgotten the names of them (helpful I know). The food itself was ok, nothing to knock my socks off, but Mediterranean brunch isn't something I'd usually go for.

4.0,2/6/2012,"Navigating Restaurant Week in New York City can be tough. Will I still receive good service even though I'm paying half the price? Will the food live up to the hype of the restaurant? I've made the mistake of going to a restaurant just for its name before, and I deeply regretted it. Boulud Sud has a stellar reputation, and thankfully it lived up to everything I heard -- and then some.I started salivating over the menu two weeks before I even entered the posh Mediterranean eatery. To start, I chose the North African Spiced Chickpea Soup. Normally I wouldn't go for something like this at all, but I'm glad I decided to choose a dish out of my comfort zone. Topped with cumin yogurt and cilantro, I loved the refreshing tang the yogurt brought to the rich soup. The texture of the roasted chickpeas added just the right amount of crunch to counter the soup's deep creaminess.I'm not too fond of salmon, but Lauren's Charred Atlantic Salmon with cucumber, farro and Greek yogurt dill was fresh and not too fishy. The Greek yogurt and dill sauce was extremely interesting, adding a nice brightness to the plate. Although the Grilled Lamb Merguez looks kind of strange (you know you're thinking the same thing I am), it was perfectly seasoned with a nice kick of heat and smoke. The lentilles du puy were earthy, while the garlic yogurt kept the lamb moist. Grilled lamb often reminds me of street food, but this plate was elevated and anything but. Chocolate is an automatic weakness of mine, so the Neroli Chocolate Tart was a no-brainer. Topped with an orange blossom cream and paired with a pomegranate chocolate sorbet, this dessert was truly sinful. I loved the pop of the pomegranate seeds and the cream was like eating a cloud. The entire dish was rich without being overly so, and I could eat this dessert again and again.",2,0,0,Victoria P.,"Astoria, NY",25,57,0
5.0,2/3/2012,"Disclaimer-This review might seem a tad over dramatic, but I've been searching for that perfect dinner for years and finally I found it.I arrived at Boulud Sud on a chilly Thursday night after a perfectly ordinary spin class. 3 appetizers, one main course and 2 glasses of water later I walked out in what I can only describe as food-induced delirium.Everything started with an unexpected explosion of scrumptious seafood flavors packed in tiny sea urchin and crab tartines, followed by crispy artichokes alla Romana of frail texture and  piquant aroma. I risked getting an allergic reaction to almonds just to try Octopus alla Plancha and it was well worth it. Octopus was perfectly soft and savory, complemented by rich white sauce and balanced out by tartness of arugula.Naturally I assumed that main course couldn't possibly match up to this assortment of appetizers, but to my surprise it managed to top them all and truly be a culmination of the meal. We ordered Maine sea diver scallops.  Topped with nectarous apple peel and placed on the bed of black polenta, they were complemented  by rich mix of broussel sprouts, hazelnuts and sunchokes.Needless to say this was a bite of heaven I'll remember for a while.

5.0,1/29/2012,"You know how sometimes you read a film review that says something like ""This is the reason why we go to the movies,"" and you roll your eyes, because who actually talks like that, what does that even mean? Well, that's exactly the feeling with which I left Boulud Sud last week after lunch. Seriously, for Restaurant Week. I've really only had a couple of experiences with ""RW"" in the past, and they've all been dismal at worst or passable at best, so I've just never taken it seriously. But after stumbling out of Boulud Sud (half in ecstasy, half drunk from an amazing bottle of wine split between myself and two friends), a light-bulb went off, the stars aligned, I finally got it -- what it's all about.They pulled out all the stops for us. Literally, all the bells and whistles. Beautiful venue, beautiful waitstaff, beautiful food, beautiful service. For $24.07 per person (before tax and tip, or supplements)?! Ridiculous! Absurd! How is this even possible? I doubt anybody lost money, but even if they did, I enjoyed the hell out of myself.Two different breads (my memory fails me) with garlic, rosemary, and olive oil were divine. Yes, the complimentary bread with our weekday Restaurant Week lunch was surprisingly, really delicious. And when we asked for more, no problem! What a way to begin a meal. And that's just to start! Then out came our bottle of wine. I googled it in advance, it had excellent reviews, and for some reason wasn't marked up 500%?! Baby Squid A La Plancha, succulent and exquisite. Chicken Leg & Thigh Tagine, a real knockout of spices and tenderness and crunchy goodness. Grapefruit Coupe, I couldn't stop moaning and groaning with delight. And that's just my meal. My friend's Celery Root Veloute was something he's been talking about non-stop for a week. And his Sweet Potato Agnolotti -- what a generous portion -- pure bliss.The regular (non Restaurant Week) menu is a bit more expensive, but after the experience I had here, I know for sure that it will be well worth it.

4.0,1/26/2012,"This review is for lunch during Restaurant Week. I arrived promptly at noon surprised to see the restaurant half empty. I had booked on Opentable and the website said there were no more openings. I decided to sit at the surprisingly comfortable bar and order off the Restaurant Week offerings. I had the baby squid, sweet potato cappelletti, and lastly the grapefruit coupe. My waiter was very attentive. The baby squid was flavor wise--very tasty especially the fried tentacles however the dish was bit oily. Next was the stuffed potato pasta which was delicious. The waiter suggested it over the amberjack and I'm glad I had it. The actual sweet potato stuffing wasn't that unique but combined with the cheese, crunchy breadcrumbs, and kale chips created a delicious combination. Also the dish used brown butter foam--an interesting, light, and fun component to the dish. There were only a few cappelletti but the dish felt well portioned. Finally I had the grapefruit coupe which is a smaller version of the Grapefruit Givre. This was surprisingly good. The halva pieces added an unusual bitter component to completely non bitter grapefruit gelee and pieces. On top is a sugar carmel tulle that adds crunch. I ate all of it. I left the restaurant feeling very well taken care of. The bread I had was an olive loaf and focaccia with cheese crust. This is served with olive oil, rosemary, and 2 slices of raw garlic.Also the crowd here is kind of old...I saw 4 women carrying canes during my one  hour.

4.0,1/25/2012,"I came here for a restaurant week lunch with two of my coworkers, and we were STUNNED (!) with the deliciousness. Also, Boulud Sud is kindly offering an entire bottle of wine for $24.07 during restaurant week, too, which is not much more than a single glass of wine goes for during the rest of the year. In other words: drink up.Although Boulud is known for his French fare, the menu here is decidedly Mediterranean. My coworkers and I declared the sweet potato cappelletti to be the standout entrée: little pockets of sweet potato covered in Parmesan foam (yes! cheese foam!) and soaked in brown butter. And the attendant kale was so flavorful, you'd be hard-pressed to convince me that it wasn't actually cheesy chicken skin masquerading as a vegetable. After trying all three desserts on the Restaurant Week menu, the winner is...the ice cream! How could something so simple trump a grapefruit sorbet / crystallized sugar concoction and a heavenly chocolate cake? Simple: take a pint's worth of flavor and compact it into a scoopful of ice cream. We were blown away by the ice cream's flavor.I heartily recommend dining at Boulud Sud now, while a power lunch is within financial reach.

The bread with olive oil from Spain, sea salt, garlic, and rosemary was a great start.  The squid appetizer was lovely.  The flavors all worked well together.  My tuna entree was bland unfortunately.  Stole a bite of my pal's sweet potato stuffed pasta with kale and it was DIVINE!  She got the grapefruit dessert- what a fun dessert!  It comes in a glass, covered with a lattice- break the edible lattice to get in the glass- finding grapefruit, sorbet, cream.  Lovely.  But don't miss the chocolate tart.  WOW.  Just WOW.  The pomegranates complement the chocolate- so unexpected-so amazing. So go NOW!  Order the squid, the sweet potato pasta, and the chocolate tart.  Fork over $32, and leave super happy.  Can't wait to come back and try the cocktails-they sound amazing.

5.0,1/20/2012,"If you arrive early at Boulud Sud for your reservation, do yourself a favor and enjoy a moment to yourself at the bar by ordering the Perfect Date cocktail (date-infused Maker's Mark, Dolin Dry Vermouth, Carpano Antico Formula). Never mind the irony of a heterosexual dude by his lonesome ordering a drink of this namesake, just trust me. It's smooth, delicious, classy, and has one of those giant glacier-like ice cubes in it. When I not-so-jokingly suggested to the bartender that such a masculine, bourbon-heavy drink didn't deserve such a lovey-dovey name, he heartily agreed with a friendly guffaw and commended me for not allowing that to deter my ordering it. A perfect response for my smart-ass remark. Please, this ain't his first rodeo.When my in-the-flesh female date arrived, we were seated and presented with the Pre-Theater Menu, a fantastic three-course, prix-fixe option at $55 served from 5p until 6:45p - an appropriate time-block given its proximity to Lincoln Center and other highbrow, WASPy shit. I had been eyeing my appetizer via their website for probably an unacceptable amount of time one should ever stalk a dish before stepping foot inside the actual establishment, but hey, the Octopus a la Plancha (+$3) just spoke to me like that. Our waitress must've seen the excitement smacked across my grill because she even teased me a bit by unveiling the plate in dramatic fashion, smirking and asking me ""Are you ready?"", as she held her hand firmly on the lid. What was revealed was decadent octopus, lightly grilled, lightly oiled, and joined by some Marcona almonds and arugula. While the much fawned-over mollusk was flavorful all its own, swirled around in its hummus base put it on another level altogether. This was a refreshing alternative to the typically smokier tentacles I've come to expect from a dish of this kind.My main course was again seafood-centric - this round, the Zaatar Baked Cod. The fish was perfectly seasoned, with mussels pre-removed from their shells, on a pillow of Greek yogurt, and with all components speared on one forkful (as the chef recommended per our waitress), it's near impossible to find anything wrong with this dish.The citrus dessert special that evening was both palate-cleansing tart and inspiringly sweet, especially after two courses of salty sea fare. The plate was essentially a block of cake and mousse topped with a blood orange yogurt rind and then accompanied by a scoop of blood orange sorbet on the side. After tasting new, enheartened ways to present octopus and cod, it was no surprise for this fruit to be used so creatively in a Boulud Sud dessert, repurposed Mediterranean elements being the theme of the experience. Although regional fusion concept menus don't always work, the catch-all cuisine here (flavors culled from France, Spain, Italy, Greece, North Africa, and Turkey) was seamlessly organic.And if you find yourself jonesing for just one more drink (why wouldn't you be?), the Spiked Apple (Glenkinchie 12 Year Old Scotch, spiced apple cider, allspice dram, and lemon juice) is a nice follow-up to the Perfect Date. It's just as debonair, but instead of housing a huge ice cube, it has literally a huge ice apple, carved and placed in your glass and stabbed through the center with a cinnamon stick.While the decor of the restaurant didn't blow me away in pictures, that surely didn't seem to matter as she's much more of a beauty in person. The soft colors and sparse artwork are way more elegant than the cramped and cluttered establishments I tend to frequent and praise. Frankly, The New York Times review of Boulud Sud said it best when the atmosphere was described as being ""aboard the luxury liner S.S. Upper West Side, bound for the Mediterranean."" Like I said - highbrow, WASPy shit. So, get yourself to W. 64th and join the upper crust. Because if I can fake it for an evening, so can you.",11,8,8,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

I pretty much downed all of them + the Perfect Date with date-infused Makers Mark. My friend also tried the the Scarlet Pom (vodka, Amaro Montenegro, pom and I'm fairly certain a purple ice cube)Definitely will come back for a proper dinner.  Service was lovely and attentive-- maybe too attentive which led me to drink a lot more than one should prior to a 2.5 hr chinese opera dance show.  I definitely should've have switched to coffee but whiskey is just so good... Only negatives: the bathroom is far. Bar Boulud has a bit of a trek to the downstairs bathroom and Boulud Sud around the corner uses the exact same bathroom.  It was a bit of a labyrinth.  Also for some reason at 7pm the front area was packedddd which made my bathroom journey take even longer.  The bottleneck of traffic was like a Murray Hill bar + 20-30yrs on the demographic age.  Maybe it was just a one off but it took a while to shuffle and weave to exit.  But none of these would prevent me from being a repeat customer!",4,0,2,Jen J.,"Tiburon, CA",114,250,54
5.0,12/28/2011,"El Jefe Boulud has nailed it again with his newest addition to the NYC scene.  It is quintessential Upper West Side luxury - elegant, but more relaxed than the Upper East Side.  The theme here is pan-Mediterranean, as in French, Greek, Italian, and most importantly, north African - so you can get an excellent chicken tagine here if you so choose.  The dining room is beautiful without being over the top.  The volume in the dining room is somewhat loud, but without being noisy.  I spoke with the GM for a while on one of my visits and he told me all about the design and the acoustics, etc that were designed in to strike the perfect balance in the dining room - really no stone left unturned.  On my most recent visit, we sat at the bar for dinner as the dining room was packed, as it always seems to be.  The staff at the bar is excellent - they are friendly as well as attentive.  We each had glasses of red, and started off with the warm lavash with hummus, falafel, and Babaganoush.  It was absolutely excellent.  For dinner, we got the charred wagyu beef, with spagetti squash and pine nuts and the lamb, with eggplant yogurt and couscous.  All of our dishes were incredible.  The portions were not enormous, but definitely big enough for dinner.  I have been here 4 times in about 2 months.  I keep finding ways to come back here with either the wife, friends or colleagues, and every time I have an excellent experience.",7,1,2,Dan C.,"New York, NY",989,942,532

We sat at the end of a row of banquettes and were seated promptly at 5:00. At 5:15 the table right next to us was seated with another couple while the next two tables remained empty for the next 45 minutes. Why would the host not put them further away and give both parties more personal space for a longer time? I also felt that the decor was really lacking.

4.0,10/24/2011,"I'm not a person who is easily impressed by gimmicks and tricks,* but the bartender at Boulud Sud got me with the Spiked Apple. First of all, it's a single malt cocktail that is subtle and delicious. That in itself is a feat.** But even more astonishing is that they go to the trouble of making an APPLE out of ICE, complete with a cinnamon stick stem, and using it as a glass within your glass for your cocktail. A more perfect fall cocktail, I don't think there is. And if single malts scare you, try the From the Field (Honey Comb and Lavender Infused Plymouth Gin, Lemon).I found the food to be a bit less consistent than the cocktails, but there are certainly high points. The charred squid stuffed with chorizo was a meager portion, but excellent; the lamb loin was beautifully cooked and as tender as can be; the Iberico ham predictably melts until your mouth is weeping with porky deliciousness; and the farrotto side was so rich and flavorful that our table ordered another, despite being full to bursting. Each item that emerges from the Boulud Sud kitchen is artfully plated, and there is clearly no lack of skill.That said, there are certain Items that I probably wouldn't revisit on a return trip: the daurade (their spelling, not mine), the crispy artichokes and the rabbit porchetta (not at all what I was expecting/hoping for; it was a cold terrine, which is unlike any porchetta I've ever heard of), for instance.Truly, nothing was bad. We cleaned every plate and enjoyed every bite. Do I think there are better options in NYC at this price point? Certainly. However, the service is impeccable, the cocktails impressive, the restaurant itself gorgeous, and if you have the means you should treat yourself to a truly fine dining experience.__________*This is a lie.

5.0,10/4/2011,"After much careful research, I chose Boulud's newest restaurant for an important birthday dinner. It absolutely lived up to my high expectations. We started out with the soupe de poisson. Having lived in Monaco for a year, I am an expert on this dish If I do say so myself. It became one of my favorite soups over the course of that year overseas and I long for it often. Until now, the only place to consistently find it was Chez Jacqueline in the village, where it is decent, but nothing to write home about. The rendition at Boulud Sud however, is absolutely the best that I have ever had. Sometimes soupe de poisson can be mealy, this was not, and for fish soup it was shockingly unfishy. The chunks of fish in it as well as the various veggies was a very nice addition. The garlic roux was also fabulous. I slightly missed the usual shredded parm, but overall it was amazing. Next we had the sheep's milk cheese and olive, the crispy artichokes, and the ratatouille. As cheese lovers trying this concoction was a must. It was very yummy. The juxtaposition of the almost sour sharp sheep cheese with the sweet olive tapenade was excellent. The crispy artichokes were slightly more fried tasting than I ideally would have liked, but they were nice and firm, well seasoned, and had a great sauce accompanying them. The ratatouille we ordered at the urging of several reviews that I had read prior to going to dinner. I will admit that I generally am not a big fan of ratatouille. Boulud's version is definitely far superior to anything that I have had in the past. The egg did add a nice creamy element and everything was perfectly cooked. I'm not sure that I found this dish to be quite as amazing as others though. It was good, but good for ratatouille. For our mains, we shared the lamb and the dourade. The lamb was possibly the highlight of the entire meal. The eggplant was so well done it was actually sweet which along with the tartness of the cucumber yogurt sauce on the lamb was amazing. Everything was perfectly perfectly cooked and proportioned. I'd give this dish 6 stars without hesitation. The dourade however was not quite as special. While I have no particular complaints and found it to be good, it lacked the innovation of pretty much everything else that we had. With the recommendation of our lovely server, we shared the peach zabaglione and the cassata for dessert. Both of these desserts were like nothing we had ever had before. The peach was a combination of fresh shaved peach, congealed sangria, and a rice pudding flavored ice cream. The different consistencies made it really interesting on the tongue and the flavors really worked. The cassata was a personal highlight for me. As a dessert lover and home baker, I really appreciate different and unusual flavors. The cardamom ricotta mousse combined with a heavy chocolate cake and rich coffee ice cream was quite different. Even though I've frequently had cardamom in Indian sweets, the primary combination with the ricotta and then the combination with everything else made it completely new. Highly highly recommend. I walked out feeling like the $90 tab per head was appropriate and well worth the experience. I will absolutely return.",3,1,2,Laura B.,"New York, NY",345,110,2
4.0,9/19/2011,"First and foremost, my fiance and I are huge Boulud fans. We only live a few blocks from Bar Boulud and would count it amongst our favorite brunch locations (seriously, do yourself a favor... try the French Toast!) We also recently discovered the oysters at E'picerie Boulud. They may just be the best ever! Daniel is on the bucket list, so unfortunately, I am not able to comment on it... yet. But, last night, we decided to pop into Boulud Sud - a place the Mr. had been, but I had not. Unless we make distinct plans to go out and ""dine"", most ofter our decisions are spur of the moment and we tend to be bar-dwellers when it comes to dining. I like the more casual feel of dining in this fashion. It also makes me feel less guilty about sharing dishes. My issue is, I want to try everything, but I can only eat so much, so ordering a few small plates and a main course to split at the bar seems much more acceptable than it would by taking up a table. The bar here is great for this kind of dining - nice and open, and the menu is practically designed for sharing. At the bar, we were greeted by the very friendly and helpful, Samantha. She made excellent drink recommendations (and cocktails!) and over all seemed knowledgeable of the menu and willing to give her opinion. I am no expert, but the Mr. is a sommelier, so I generally let him just choose my wine - he knows what I like! We were on different pages last night, so rather than sharing a bottle, we opted for the glass list, which he mentioned has not a dud in the bunch. For food - we ordered the following: *Soupe de Poisson - I was expecting this to be more of a shellfish based soup. It wasn't, but it was still delicious. Great consistency and not overly ""fishy"" (silly comment for a fish soup, I know!) *Seared Spanish Mackerel - colorful presentation, flawlessly cooked and great pick all around. *Spiced Duck Kataifi - this may be the only thing we disagreed on - while we both loved the flavors, perfectly spiced, the chutney was excellent. We disagreed on the need for the pastry crust around the outside. Mr. thought it was unnecessary, while I loved it - it added a nice texture (think... shredded wheat?) to what may have otherwise been a mushy dish. *Moroccan Mint-Chocolate Pave' - very delicious, not overly sweet, nice presentation. ***RATATOUILLE AND OEUF MOLLET!!!! - The reason we came. When the Mr. was here last, he had this and has not stopped talking about it since. So, of course it was both a must-have and a source of doubt in my mind. How could it possibly be that good??? I don't even know how to explain how incredible this simple dish was. The first bite, I was onboard, not 100% sold, but with it. All ingredients that appeal to me - eggplant, peppers, onions, etc., a super soft egg you mix in. But after another bite or two, the flavors really started to blend and pop. It had a great consistency, almost creamy, which I think is due in part to the egg. Long story short - I do not think you can come here without trying this dish. It was really quite special. Overall, I highly recommend this place and will certainly return. There are still so many other dishes to try!",1,0,0,Amanda G.,"Newport, RI",3,19,0

4.0,7/8/2011,"Besides Daniel Boulud, DB stands for doing it better.In recent years, DB has adapted to the economic times and has adopted the upscale, casual dining concept that Keith McNally had perfected (Balthazar, Schiller's Liquor Bar) with Bar Boulud and recently, Boulud Sud. Unlike McNally, the food at Boulud's brasseries are not merely an afterthought to the location and ambience.The dining room feels like being on a cruise liner on the Mediterranean: gently curving whitewashed ceilings, recessed lightning, and the primly dressed waitstaff provide a light and airy background for the meal-at-hand.I promptly skipped the overpriced wine-by-the-glass list and I started out with a Jenlain Biere de Mars, a versatile French saison whose hints of malt and peppery notes blend well with land, sea, and garden-driven menu.Although slightly overcooked, the pan-seared Octopus a la Plancha was seasoned well with some paprika and harissa oil. The chickpea paste, marcona almonds, and sherry vinegar all provided good textural contrasts with the meatiness of this dish.More a nod to Bar Boulud next door, the Rabbit Porchetta gives rise to my theory that the Lyonnaise find it next to impossible to mess up charcuterie. Unctuous, gamy, and meaty, this wonderful dish was brightened by some thinly shaved pencil asparagus and a couple dots of basil oil.The Harira Soup would be what the Moroccans would envision chicken soup, but replacing the pieces of poulet and shards of noodle were little fideos and dabs of cinnamon- and cardamom-spiced meat balls and little fideos in addition to the mirepoixed vegetables. Homely, satisfying, but brilliantly complex, I cannot look at matzo ball soup in the same way again.As a palate cleanser between savory and dessert, the bartender offered me a cocktail that he was tweaking for the menu: Watermelon, Rum, Lime Juice, and a bit ouzo. Although it could have used a savory component, the drink takes ice sculpture to a new level, with a 2"" spherical ball comprised of frozen and strained watermelon puree, watermelon rind, and ice. Besides being beautiful to look at, it keep the cocktail cool, and adds another fruity element to the drink with the melting of the watermelon puree.For dessert, I started off with a Macvin du Jura, a dessert wine from the oft-neglected French region made from Pinot Noir. It's one of the few dessert wines that has the acidity to play off citrus-dominated dessert dishes such as the Grapefruit Givre I ordered.  I hardly recommend going to a restaurant to only order dessert, but this is one of sheer pastry genius. A grapefruit half is scooped out, filled with grapefruit sorbet, piped with sesame mousse, mixed with grapefruit segments and rose loukoum, and garnished with an almond tuile and halvah cotton candy. Like a Ferran Adria dish, you'd expect the contrasting textures and flavors to deconstruct, but somehow the acid from the grape fruit harmoniously blends together with the savory sesame, halvah, and loukoum.Screw Josephina and Cafe Fiorello: DB just conquered the Lincoln Center restaurant scene by doing it better.",4,2,6,Jonas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,166,0

A well-oiled machine, delightful to watch as our dinner progressed.As the place's name implies, the menu offers specialties of southwestern France and the Mediterranean coast. We began with a shared small plate--rabbit porchetta with thinly-sliced asparagus and a splash of basil oil--that presaged the rest of our dinner--interesting, exciting food, beautifully presented.Joy really enjoyed her fish soup with John Dory, so reminiscent of the bouillabaisse at Chez Tétou in Golfe-Juan right by the Mediterranean. After a sip, maybe I could be forgiven for imagining West 64th as a coastline!My own appetizer was a pair of small squid, stuffed with chorizo in kind of a pesto, topped with a lovely tomato-based sauce. Once again, the presentation was beautiful, with the tiny tentacles carefully placed atop each squid. Absolutely first-rate.A few words about the wines: The list is almost exclusively French, with a broad range of bottles priced from moderate to expensive. We had a tasty bottle of Burgundy, chosen with the help of a friendly young sommelier, for about $60.Breads offered were a well-seasoned focaccia and an interesting flatbread. The bread server presented a plate with a small slice of garlic, a few pieces of Rosemary and some salt and pepper, then poured some good Spanish olive oil over the seasonings, allowing the oil to become scented right before us. A nice little touch.Joy's entrée was cedar-plank grilled Rouget stuffed with baby fennel, absolutely delicious, and served next to rolled up cedar ""paper"" in another very creative presentation. I had capretto with house-made orrechiette in yet another extraordinarily tasty sauce. Just terrific.For dessert, we shared a fabulous concoction of julienned mango and caramelized rhubarb with yogurt sorbet, all sitting atop a thin slice of semolina cake. Excellent double espressos brought things to a close.As a point of interest, they plan before too long, to open for brunch. I have no doubt they'll do as great a job with that as they did for dinner.Across the street at Picholine, Terrance Brennan might not be too happy about it, but we might have to begin calling that stretch of West 64th ""rue Boulud""!Burt SpielmanMadison, NJ",0,0,0,Burton S.,"Madison, NJ",0,2,0
5.0,5/15/2011,"We came here for my sisters graduation (which was at Lincoln Center).  My mother made a 5:00 PM reservation, which of course I thought was ridiculous, but by about 5:45/6:00 the place was packed.  This place, only being open for two days, was some of the best service I have ever experienced in my life.  Our waiter (whose name escapes me) was absolutely charming.  I ordered the Lincoln Spritzer which was Amaretti (still need to google exactly what that is) and Champagne, with a huge lemon zest swirled around the glass.  To start we got the SICILIAN SARDINE ESCABÈCHE  with Toasted Pine Nuts & White Raisins, CHICKPEA which was herb falafel, fresh hummus, & crispy lavash, EGGPLANT BABAGANOUSH caponata with grilled foccacia, ZUCCHINI FRITO with basil pesto &  lemon omani dipping sauces (MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PART OF THE MEAL), CAPRETTO ORECCHIETTE Baby Goat Ragout & Wild Garlic  (DELISH!!!!), & CRISPY ARTICHOKES ALLA ROMANAwhile all this was going on we were replenished without our plates ever going completely dry of the most delicious extra extra virgin olive oil with garlic and rosemary, flat bread & foccacia.my sister and her friend stuck with all the appetizers while we continued to main coursesFor our main course I ordered GRILLED SCALLOPS with stewed tomatoes, crispy socca, my best friend and mother ordered the CEDAR GRILLED ROUGET with baby fennel...none of us have ever tried rouget, and let me tell you, it was DELISHHHHHHHHHHHH...grams got the ARISSA GRILLED LAMB LOIN with Algerian eggplant We couldnt possibly pass up dessert since everything was so delicious.  So we ordered the GRAPEFRUIT GIVRÉ Sesame Halva, Rose Loukoum (for us not fancy people, it was grapefruit ices with a sesame halva toping with a cotton candy like rose tasting topping) & the CASSATA Chocolate Sacher, Ricotta-Cardamom Mousse, Candied Fruits, Coffee Gelato (I cant even explain how delish this dessert was...the coffee gelato was a force to be reckoned with)Overall the experience was wonderful...the bill for six people including cocktails was doable, and the bright airy ambiance would make me recommend this restaurant for any occasion.",3,0,2,Alyson S.,"Augusta, GA",371,27,23
