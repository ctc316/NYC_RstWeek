2,4/13/2019,Very disappointed. Went years ago and the place was so fun and delicious. Now just a dark hole with an arrogant and untrained staff. Food was just boring. Won't be going back.,0,0,0,Charlotte F.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
1,4/9/2019,Can I give this ZERO STARS? THEY LOST OUR CREDIT CARD. Enough said. Server didn't bring what we asked. Don't come here. SERVICE IS EXTREMELY POOR. The manager didn't even seem to really care. Don't come here.,0,0,0,Ava A.,"New York, NY",0,14,7
4,3/27/2019,"We were long overdue for a visit to Mercer Kitchen. Easy to make a reservation. The food was very good. The spring pea salad was light but lovely. I had the salmon. Unfortunately it had a few bones in it, but the restaurant kindly comped it and apologized when I pointed that out. The burger was very good. Good service. Beautiful space, though downstairs so not a lot of natural light.",0,0,0,J. Karim A.,"New York, NY",64,795,334

1,3/21/2019,"Yes, we were in from out of town, but I had high hopes for a cool, casual meal.  What a terrible experience.  So sad, as I had my family with me.  Lame, lame, lame all the way around.  Sweet, but completely dopey server.  Waited a really long time to be greeted, served our drinks, our appetizer was pathetically boring, entrees took 50 minutes to receive.  We sat in a dark corner watching the toddler at the table next to us have a tantrum.  I would have had a trantrum too, except I am too old.  Too many other wonderful opportunities in NYC to waste your time on this place.  Move on to nicer, more fun places.  This place is gliding on its old press coverage.",0,0,0,Wendy A.,"Denver, CO",847,10,0

4,3/17/2019,The menu is a little expensive but the food was very good. I got a burger and it came with two small sides the burger was a little undercooked for me and I asked for it to be adjusted after asking for medium rare and it came out and was very good.

5,3/14/2019,"Mercer is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.  There are so many fantastic places to go for dinner.. it can be very overwhelming...Everything about Mercer Kitchen has always been on point (occasionally the food can take a little long, but the ambience makes up for it). The space is beautiful and classy.  All of the items on the menu I have tried in the past have been wonderful, but what really keeps me coming back again and again and again.. is the skate.. the fish is served steamed and is light and healthy... the wax beans are great as well.   I had dinner at Mercer with a friend last night and she had the coconut soup and salmon.  We both took leftovers home to enjoy today even though we could have easily finished everything.Can't wait to return!!!",0,0,0,Erin H.,"New York, NY",0,13,3
1,3/9/2019,"Cool atmosphere & nice staff for sure, but that's about all that was good. The shrimp salad was delicious, but that's about it. I'm the biggest sashimi crispy rice fan, and this one was disgusting. Sent it back. Never thought I'd be sending back food at a Jean Georges owned restaurant. Highly disappointed, and it was incredibly expensive for what was really not a good meal at all.",0,0,0,Rachel G.,"New York, NY",582,41,29
2,3/9/2019,"Cool ambiance & nice staff, but the food was honestly not very good & absurdly expensive. I could've made what we ordered better than they did & that's saying something. The shrimp salad is really good, don't order the sashimi crispy rice it tasted kinda gross. Surprised this place is so popular considering how expensive it is for subpar food.

4,2/23/2019,"First time to have a dinner with my friends at Mercer Kitchen past Monday (The president day).The restaurant self is classy and intimate.  They have a nice bar on first floor that people can hang out for drinks. The main dining room is at the lower level which is spacious.  The food was delicious overall.  We shared few appetizers (prosciutto pizza, carpaccio of black sea brass caviar, seafood platter).  I liked my main course - lamp chops.  My friends also liked their dishes (lobster, scallops, steak) as well.  desserts were good.  The service was friendly.  One of my friend told me that it's a dating spot which a lot of people had successful dates at this restaurant .It's one of my place in soho now!",1,0,0,Joyce C.,"New York, NY",0,39,122

3,2/18/2019,"5 stars for ambiance, 3 stars for the burger, which is the most important part hence the rating. I googled the best burger in soho and Mercer Kitchen came up. I had a bout of nostalgia from 10+ years ago when Mercer Kitchen was a seen/be seen restaurant. The burger was tall, but about the circumference of an in n out burger: small. The fries were just okay, so there wasn't a lot going on to justify its $25+ price tag. All in all, I'd say you can confidently skip MK on your quest for a solid NYC burger.",0,0,0,Alison Z.,"Corona, CA",21,106,24
2,2/18/2019,"Mercer Kitchen is the place for you if you're looking for a restaurant with a nice ambiance. Outside of offering a dimly lit space, there isn't much else here. I ordered my burger 'medium well', and it arrived medium rare. My fries were oily, my apple cinnamon cake was cold, and the wait staff seemed to think nothing of it.

1,2/15/2019,"This rating is based on the horrible service of this place. My family and I ( total 3) went to Mercer Kitchen on a Saturday night. After reading some of the reviews, we felt comfortable having dinner there. The minute we walked in, we headed to the bar, and the bartender said: ""The restaurant is on the 3rd floor"". So we took the elevator and once we arrived to the restaurant floor. The host asked how many people and we happily replied:  two adults and a toddler, she immediately responds and I quote: ""We do not take any walk ins. Try the bar downstairs."" Keeping in mind that the restaurant was half empty. We went back to the bar on the main floor. The staff were very rude, unfriendly and literally looked at us like if we had ten heads. We patiently waited for someone to come and seat us. Three of the staff came to us and told us to wait. We finally had enough of the charade. We got the point. My family and myself are people of color and these people had no respect for our kind. They couldn't care less when we expressed our disappointment.",0,0,0,Sara E.,"Queens, NY",18,4,0
1,2/15/2019,Came for Valentine's Day. Service was terrible didn't have a waiter or waitress for more than half hour and had to ask for my order to be taken. Didn't get our drinks order taken and didn't even get refill on our water for table. Food wasn't too bad but the bad service left a bad taste in my mouth so I didn't even finish or enjoy meal.  Would not recommend  for an upscale looking place this was a big disappointment,0,0,0,James P.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,10,1
2,2/14/2019,"If you like having a conversation with your date, I'd recommend somewhere else. The communal tables are packed too tightly together, and therefore hearing your partner is very difficult, as a consequence everyone is shouting to be heard, exacerbating the problem. The food is good, but only at par for the $250-to-$300 price point. I had the peppercorn steak for my entree. It was competently prepared. They don't honor gift cards from other nameplates in the Jean-George's restaurant group. If you read the fine print on the back of your card before going, more power to you. If you don't ,you will be surprised at the end, as I was, since every other restaurant group cross-honors gift cards (Landry's, One Group, etc.). There's just too many restaurants in Manhattan where for the price I can have an incredible experience with my partner without another couple in our laps and with amazing food... so I won't be back, but don't take my review as the sole judge, a lot of people clearly enjoy this spot, and I'm sure they have good reasons, too.",2,1,0,Mark M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0
5,2/14/2019,"I had the best dining experience here. The ambiance is perfect, and the food is amazing. The service is very attentive. The steak was a bit more rare than wanted, so they quickly put it back on the pan. In the meantime, they brought out tuna tar tar compliments of the chef. After dinner, we asked for the check. They gave us another complimentary desert item to apologize for the undercooked steak. Great food, great service, very worth it go eat here!!",0,0,0,Matthew B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

While we were not a fan of the more experimental dish we ordered (the tuna/wasabi pizza) everything else was absolutely divine. The manager came over to apologize for that one pizza, which was a lovely touch, and the waitress was very sincere and efficient. Also I was impressed that the chef came out to congratulate the newly engaged couple. Had the endive salad that I am still craving today!

4,2/8/2019,"We had Dinner here last night and it was Hoppin' for a Thursday night. Very busy. Cool vibe. This place has had a long run in popularity. Dining room and bar located downstairs. The staircase is wide open so you don't feel like u are in a basement, which is nice.  You can see upstairs from below. Hostess station located at the bottom of stairs with a small waiting area and a coat room. Lively bar. While waiting for our full party to arrive, the dining room burst into applause as there was a marriage proposal in the back of the room. The chef came out to congratulate the couple. Very sweet.We started with signature cocktails (vodka lemonade) and I had a glass of red wine. I had to ask for another wine glass because the stem and glass felt grimy and sticky. Felt dirty. It is restaurant week so they had 3-course offerings with included an appetizer, entree and dessert. I had the burrata, the grilled shrimp entree, and a poached pear for dessert. Three of us had the burrata and it was excellent. The shrimp was a little over grilled. The portions were on the small side. My husband had the veal Milanese which was tender enough to cut with a fork. Two large thin veal cutlets. The veal was not part of the restaurant week specials. Very good. The others had the pasta special which they loved. Our waiter was excellent and entertaining. It's a team effort here and they keep things moving. We had Busing staff clearing plates, someone else serving drinks, and our waiter who kept checking in. They offer several long communal tables. Good for large parties. We had a party of 4 at 8:15 and made reservation on Open-table. (Note -full party must be present to be seated)We have been here several times and will definitely go back.",0,0,0,Susan M.,"Narragansett, RI",74,264,330
4,2/7/2019,"Two girlfriends and I came here last night for Restaurant Week. We had seen online they were offering a really good menu this season, so we were excited to try it. Once we sat down, we realized some of the items online were not on the menu, and some were different, which was a little disappointing. The menu was still good tho.For an appetizer, two of us had the pizza with caramelized onions and bacon. It was good and a large portion, my other friend had the burratta which she liked. For entrees we all had the burger lol. It was good, nothing spectacular, fries kinda of reminded us of McDonald's as well as the bun the burger was served on. For dessert, two of us had the chocolate molton cake and I had the poached pear. The pear was probably my favorite thing of the meal because it was unlike anything I've had and it was served in a chocolate sauce.Overall everything was good, but nothing was great. I think I had higher expectations based on the fact that it is a restaurant by Jean-Georges. I definitely wouldn't rush back anytime soon. The place did have great ambiance tho and service was good. Very large restaurant, and modernly decorated and dimly lit. Would be a nice spot for a date.",0,1,0,Kristen W.,"New York, NY",287,130,151

Hostesses were rude and stood around staring into the abyss while we waited for a table (after making a reservation.) Drinks were mediocre and the food was nothing to rave about.

1,1/30/2019,"Okay, I wanted to give this place a bad review but it already has poor ratings. The management here is terrible. Our reservation was for 8:45 for a birthday that we called a week in advance for. As much as I understand that nights get busy and there are things that come up-for a place that should hold a high reputation, it's pretty unacceptable that we have to wait over half an hour for reservations. They also had us wait awkwardly right in the middle of the restaurant. After standing for a good while and finally finding the manager, I'd have to say he was courteous but was reluctant to give us complimentary cocktails for our inconvenience. We haven't tried the food here, but just based on management experience alone, if the food is not life changing, it will already terrible because we had to wait so long. Sorry, but please improve your management/service. This isn't a low end establishment and I definitely don't feel like I am at one.",0,0,0,Lee L.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,32,0
3,1/24/2019,"I came here with my sister a week ago for dinner and I was quite disappointed.  For the table we had the Sashimi Salmon and Burrata.  The crispy rice for the Sashimi Salmon was not crispy enough.  The burrata was good but I wished it came with more bread.We both shared an entree - the Veal Milanese which they split into 2 plates for us - I appreciated that.  However the veal was very salty.For dessert, we had the butterscotch pudding which is the best meal I've had.1 point is taken off for taste.  Another point is taken off for service.  We were seated right next to the busboy station and while a waiter was always there doing whatever a waiter does, we were not given a lot of attention.  Twice, I had to signal the waiter to clear our plates.A redeeming quality is that when I told them the veal was too salty, they didn't charge us for dessert.Will I come again?  Yes, I will try another dish but this trip was definitely a disappointment.",0,0,0,Anna K.,"New York, NY",17,92,53

Steamed skate was totally tasteless and accompanied you rice covered in vinegar!??? Good thing the waxed beans were delicious or I would have left hungry.

It's also quite nice around the holidays, just has a nice holiday feel to it.On my most recent visit we had the baked olives, which I wouldn't recommend. It was basically just warmed olives, not really worth it. For those who are gluten free, they do have a gluten free bread option available if you ask for it. It was quite tasty. We also had the honeynut squash, kale salad, artichoke, and black sea bass. All were very good. If you're looking to duck out of the crowds in SoHo and have a quality meal, pop into Mercer Kitchen.

I am fully obsessed with the Salmon on Crispy Rice bites and typically order them for an appetizer, and then again for an entree. Last time I had the Chicken, it was very good. Do not get the shrimp and fennel salad, it is very bland and overrated Do not get the artichoke- it's steamed and also bland and overrated.

Spotted in this pic is their margarita pizza which is amazing. With tomato sauce, chunks of mozzarella, basil, with a swish of olive oil across it, this pizza hit the spot. Each slice just as buttery as the last I was in pizza heaven. Beside their pizza their lox, cream cheese bagel is my breakfast go to. Every drink is a crisp treat.

We came here last night for dinner after not coming for a year and we could not have been more disappointed.  Our server was very kind and attentive, which is the only reason why I even gave it 2 stars but the food was so terrible, especially for the price you pay here.  For appetizers we ordered the warm artichoke, which was absolutely flavorless and dry, and the quinoa and avocado salad, that was not dressed at all and had no seasoning or flavor.  We then ordered the poppyseed crusted salmon for our main dish, which we had to send back because it tasted so fishy to both of us (we have never had to send back fish anywhere so it was really bad).  We ordered the burger instead, which is the only thing that tasted good the entire night.  There are so many other great restaurants in the neighborhood, I would definitely avoid coming here at all costs.  You can seriously get a better meal at Shake Shack for a fraction of the price.",0,0,0,Cass V.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",2,10,1

You can continue shopping after lunch.  The food here is alright. Nothing really special. The pricing on it is also high for the amount of food that you get. Every single time, even with reservations, you still have to wait 15 minutes. What is the point in even having reservations when you have to wait every single time. The service is also very meh.

2,12/17/2018,"I have been thinking about coming to Mercer Kitchen for dinner as I heard good reviews from a friend of mine, and was out walking around with said friend and a few other girlfriends who suggest we stop for coffee and dessert (she raved about how good the deserts are). It was off-peak hours (like 3:30 pm) and she had previously been there for just desserts so we figured giving it a try.We walked in and asked to sit in the upstairs area and all we got from the waitress was ""we're full"" and she walked away. Ok.. but I saw a few empty or dirty tables, so it didn't seem like they were really that full, but I guess they take reservations, so fine. It took a while to get her attention again as she obviously was not interested in helping us and finally got told to go downstairs since upstairs is only for ordering full meals upstairs. It was the weekend, so fair point, but she could have just politely told us this before. We went down to an empty bar and sat there. We ordered coffees from a bartender who absolutely could not be bothered with us, despite empty seats on either side. A simple cup of brewed coffee was $6-- and nothing special to warrant that price. The one dessert we had the chance to order was decent, but no one bothered to check back with us while we were sitting there. We planned to order a few more but at a certain point it just wasn't worth it. Nothing terrible happened, but every person we interacted with was unfriendly and not helpful.  Yes, we were ""just"" having coffee and dessert for the moment, but we were still customers (at an otherwise empty bar) who would have lingered with a glass of wine or two and likely returned another occasion.

5,12/14/2018,"I love Mercer Kitchen, it's one of my 'go to' places in NYC. It's also across the street from one of my other favorite places in NYC, Lure Fishbar, so if I can't get into one, I will generally go to the other one. The restaurant itself is exactly what you would expect from a Jean-Georges Soho restaurant. It's upscale, bougee, expensive, and spectacular in every way possible. The people working here as well as patrons of the restaurant all tend to be beautiful and bougee too. I love the dimly lit, 'secretive' downstairs, I will often pop down just to have a drink at the bar and people watch. They have a glassed in private room downstairs that's almost always rented out by a group of people. The last time I was here they were packed for the holiday season, so we ended up eating in their small upstairs area (much prefer downstairs). We split the sashimi salmon (a staple of Jean-Georges), which was awesome, as expected and also split the peekytoe crab salad and brussel sprout pizza. The crab salad was light and delicious, with cabbage, fresh crab, and shredded pieces of apple, with a few sesame seeds on top in a light dressing. The pizza was cut into four pieces and was perfect for the two of us. I could swear half the people in here were either gorgeous, well dressed models or high end hedge fund guys in suits.

The soup was also delicious, although it was burning hot when it came out and took a while to cool down. However, once it did the soup was very good and it came with some sticky rice which I dipped into the broth, which paired well together!

My s/o and I arrived without a reservation and was greeted after 2 minutes by a staff who asked if we wanted to be seated near the front (aka upstairs) since there was a table available. While waiting for our table to be cleaned, a different staff member approached us and asked us ""how many?"", we told him we were already being helped and our table was getting cleaned, and pointed towards the table. With a tone, the staff replied with "" that's not your table, that table is for the couple right here"", however, the couple that was standing in the corner had just come up from downstairs and was getting ready to leave. I said for the second time "" we are being helped and we were told that table was for us"", the staff continued to say "" that's not your table"", until the couple turned to the staff and said "" we're not waiting, we're leaving"" and just so then the staff member who was helping us came up to the staff member and whispered "" they're waiting for this table"". To my s/o and I, we felt offended by the tone of voice the staff used to tell us the table wasn't ours. At least ask the other couple if they're waiting for a table before telling us off. That, overall, was a terrible way to start our night. Then came the food, the food was alright, nothing special about it to be honest. We ordered fish and chips and the truffle pizza. The pizza was mediocre for the price. The only good part was probably the Fish and chips, they were seasoned well and were made just right.

It was also not evenly sauced, leaving me on a rollercoaster ride of unseasoned meat to hot sauce burning my tongue. My friend ordered the burger which she didn't even have the will to finish. The wine was disappointing, incredibly young and underdeveloped at $76 a bottle. Not a good selection for mid-range reds, and in general for the wines. Didn't order dessert because at that point I half-expected it to come from the frozen aisle of a supermarket. The extra star is purely for the interior design of this place - I love the aesthetic, but everything else was so incredibly disappointing. The service wasn't terrible but very cold-handed. The final nail was that I was handed the check while we were still finishing up... incredibly rude - for me it's the difference between a 25% and 20% tip.

She said she would have the kitchen fire up a new one. When it came out the 2nd time around - the fried onions, avocado and aioli was served on the side. I removed the top bread and to my disappointment I saw the original burger patty ( w the original cheese slice) with a bite taken out of it. After closer examination, it seemed the chef literally scraped off the dressing, onions and guacamole, mircro-waved the burger and put it onto a new bun.

The bread isn't your typical french loaf, but was not memorable.As an appetizer, I went with the pizza with fromage blanc--wow was this tasty! The pizza was cooked perfectly and while the onions did not have a lot of flavor, the cartelized bacon was divine.For the second course, I got the pan roasted hake--this was also a very solid dish as the hake was well-cooked and had great flavor. My favorite part of this dish though was actually the chard and peppers mix as they provided the perfect accompaniment to the fish.To finish off the meal, I went with the chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. Though the ice cream was a bit melty and the scoop was small, it paired excellently with the molten chocolate cake that was perfectly oozing with chocolate. It really made for a delicious ending to the dinner.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by all of the courses here after reading mixed reviews online.

I mean you guys know how I feel about my cocktails + it was my birthday + we'd shopped til we dropped + WALKED those NYC blocks and needed to be refreshed. This was the perfect spin on a sunset passion colada, a coconut flavored drink with a hint of strawberry. It left us with a very nice buzz. We then ordered from the PRIXE FIX Menu which included an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. The PRIXE FIX menu offered two choices for each course. As an appetizer, patrons could choose from 3 cheese artichoke flower pizza or a refreshing heirloom tomato salad. The same applied to the entrée and dessert. Patrons could choose between the grilled lamb chops or the cod, and for dessert between the fresh fruit sorbet or the blackberry cake with ice cream. I chose the heirloom tomato salad, the grilled lamb chops, and the fresh fruit sorbet. The heirloom tomato salad was paired with an oil and vinaigrette dressing and topped with raspberries and orange peppers. The salad was very good. Light and refreshing, but the tomatoes were kind of overkill. Of course I chose lamb chops for my entrée. They were prepared beautifully. The perfect pink center (Medium), a nice char on the outside and tender inside. The chops were presented with a tomato barbecue sauce and were accompanied by mint green beans. I CLEANED THE PLATE GUYS. The earthiness and crunch from the sauteed green beans paired nicely with that soft mint taste was DELICIOUS. The lamb chops and that barbecue sauce made me want to lick my fingers and plate, but I have manners! The server came by after he noticed our plates were empty and asked were we ready for our desserts. I couldn't wait. I was so anxious and pleased with my choices thus far, I dove right on in and didn't even get a picture of the sorbet. Spoon in hand before the server could place the bowl on the table, I was excited. The sorbet flavors for the day were mango, raspberry and blueberry. That too got devoured like the rest of the meal.

The waffle had a very strange ""bready"" texture, not like the usual light and fluffy waffles. It was quite dense and an artificial sweet taste. The omelette I felt was portioned too small for the price. The decor and restaurant itself is beautiful, and the seating in the basement is awesome because the kitchen is completely open for the guests to see. Some items are good, some are bad.

The reason why I don't give 5 stars because of the service.  The waiter seems lack of patience and passion.  The problem is not just on the waiter who took our order.  Same problem is also on other waiters who clean up the table too.  They cleaned up the plates in rush and took the french fries basket away while it was still half full and I was still eating. If they have already done their best on customer service, it would be management problem and I don't blame on the waiters.  The food is good and I hope they can pay more attention on customer service.",0,0,0,Ken C.,"New York, NY",1,31,441

Would recommend Truffle pizza: 3.5/5.  Not such a truffle fan but this was really good Black Sea bass: 3.8/5. This was pretty good.

(3) Rigatoni (4.5 stars): I always found so difficult to find a good pasta place in U.S. So, this dish impressed me! The pasta was well done, the meatballs were delicious, and right amount of spice.I heard that the truffle oil pizza is amazing, I want to come back and try!The cons were the service. The waiter was very slow and messed up with our rosé (our bottle did not finish, we told it was over, but we were sure it was not. And then he figured it out that he had the wrong bottle).

I just came here for brunch with a friend last Sunday and the food was downright disgusting. She ordered the organic omelette (with Goat Cheese, Rosemary Potatoes, Mesclun Salad) and I ordered the Tagliatelle pasta (with Mixed Wild Mushrooms, Jalapeno and Herbs). The omelette looked steamed or boiled, was pretty flavorless with a few pieces of boiled potatoes and a side of salad greens that looks like it was taken directly from a container and placed onto a plate. My pasta was even worst. It was so bland, I added almost the whole side dish of salt (which you have to ask the waiter for). Nope, it didn't help improve the taste. Maybe add some black pepper? Nope, flavorless and tasteless. Asked for parm cheese to sprinkle on top and hoping to god it helps improves the taste. NOPE, I gave up. Seriously, how can anyone mess up on pasta this bad? The tagliatelle itself was bland AF. The herbs? Yeah, what happened to the herbs? Oh and the mixed mushrooms? I found 3 pieces in total. Guess mushroom prices have gone way up? For $26, I felt ripped off. I asked the waiter to pack it up (thinking maybe I can still savage this dish at home) but he decided to clean the other plates while holding my pasta plate and I could see something dripping into it. AHHHH GROSS!!!This experience was cringe worthy for me. From the bland dish to the poor wait staff etiquette.

I made sure when I made the reservation and again when we arrived to mention that we were celebrating but received absolutely no acknowledgement from anyone with the exception of the hostess' lukewarm acknowledgment that she had a corner booth for us(no big achievement given the time-3:15 pm). The waitress had no personality-she seemed incapable of warmth and had no ability to make pleasant chatter-again, completely ignoring our milestone. The food was also mediocre at worst, blah at best-with the exception of the shrimp salad. The fusilli dish my son and I planned to order was no longer on their menu even though the website hadn't reflected the change.

Nothing to write home about. Know that if you order the French toast it definitely needs to be eaten with syrup or butter, otherwise it is dry. The omelette with guyere and spinach is good but quite small, and the serving size of potatoes is small as well.

3,3/11/2018,"We visited The Mercer Kitchen with friends for a spot of lunch and we came away feeling that this place could be great but there's a few easily addressable items holding it back. Let's start with the venue and service. The space itself is pretty cool. When you get to the restaurant, you pull back a heavy curtain, walk down a flight of stairs and arrive in a dimly lit, chic area and that's when you are hit with a cacophony of sound. This place is loud. If you're hoping for a quiet, intimate lunch, this is not the restaurant for you. This didn't bother our group so much, in fact it created a nice buzz to the place. We were seated very promptly and were asked if were ready to order drinks. We asked for a few minutes and after waiting nearly twenty minutes for our server to come back, we had to wave to get her attention.Now on to the food. We ordered a number of items from the menu:- Rigatoni with meatballs: Unfortunately this was my dish and it came out stone cold and piping hot in places. I sent it back immediately and it was replaced with a new serving. The rigatoni and sauce were good however the meatballs lacked any seasoning- Eggs Benedict: They were nice enough but the portion seemed kind of small compared to other brunch places (see picture)- Fusilli with added shrimp: This got a massive thumbs up from the table. Good portion size, flavorful and promptly scoffed!- Crispy Flounder Tacos: Another win! You only get two tacos, but they are big and filled to the brim. - Side of Sauteed 7 Grains: For 10 bucks, this felt like a tiny portion. Judge for yourself from the picture.Overall, aside from the hiccups, we were satisfied and in some cases delighted with the food.

1,3/6/2018,"I will never eat here again !!! I had made a reservation for 3 people on a Sunday night. We arrived to be led to a table which was the size of a round cocktail table set for 3. The restaurant was not even half full and there were plenty of other larger tables. I refused to sit at the tiny table and asked for another larger table. The hostess did not seem pleased and led us to another 4 top that was fine. A woman came and took our drink order and when the drinks arrived, my dining companion discovered after a few sips that there was no Tito's in his Tito's and cranberry juice. When we brought it to the waiter's attention, he said oh, it is just cranberry juice. Sorry.... STRIKE 1. Ordered a meat & cheese platter for the table,  It arrived and look very good with 3 cheeses, 3 meats and accompanying garnishes and condiments. Being inquisitive, I asked what types of cheeses were on the platter. The waiter had no clue, so he went and asked someone else. He then brought another waiter to our table who told us that 2 of the cheeses are from a goat and the other from a cow. No varieties, names of the cheeses, nothing. Apparently, no one in the place knows what varieties of cheese they serve.  STRIKE 2. Accompanying the platter was some rustic wheat bread.  The bread was stale and cold in the middle, as if it had been in the freezer previously and recently defrosted. STRIKE 3. I get it - restaurants have bad nights, but this is all getting annoying at this point.  We have finished our appetizer and have now waited over 30 minutes for our entrees, which included 2 burgers at $24 each and the Pork Chop at $37. The manger comes over and apologizes that there was a problem with their printer and that our entree order never made it to the kitchen. She is very polite and apologetic. I personally informed her of all of the mishaps that have led up to this moment and she apologizes further and offers a round on drinks or dessert. We accept and move on.  The entrees arrive about 15 minutes later and they are fine. Nothing to remember, but fine. We were given complimentary coffee, capuccino and 3 desserts as well as 2 free drinks, which made up, somewhat for the bad service and delays. Upon paying for the bill, after thinking this meal could not get any worse, we paid in cash and credit card. 2 thirds in cash and a third in credit dard. When the waiter returned for me to sign my credit card receipt, I noticed that the whole bill was charged on my card!!!!I brought it to his attention and after much apology, he adjusted it. It still is showing as the original amount today, but I hope it turns out to be the correct amount so I don't have to call them to have this resolved. It seems that there are too many hands in dealing with a table. We saw at lest 5-6 different people at our table doing different tasks.

5,3/6/2018,"I was really impressed with our delicious lunch at Mercer kitchen. We arrived after mid day and waited 25 minutes for a table. The restaurant was hustling and bustling. The dining room we ate in was underground and the window on the ceiling had a few grates where you could see people walking above. I had the delicious lamb sandwich on lightly toasted thin bread that was not overwhelming.  The others at my table had the Burger and a great looking chicken sandwich. Each of us had a different cut of french fry with our sandwiches. One standard yet yummy, One came in a crisp house cut potato chip, and one in a crispy yummy waffle cut. We loved the variety and our server brought us a chipotle mayo for dipping that was so delicious. If everyone orders a different sandwich I recommend getting different types of potatoes like this.  There were other delicious items on the menu and people around us were nibbling on wonderful looking artichokes. We saw some other appetizers like tuna over crispy rice that also looked appetizing. I will absolutely go back to Mercer kitchen the next time I'm in NYC.

Every side is $10, which is great for when you want to substitute something for a different side, the waitress tried to tell us substitutions were an extra charge until I had to hold the menu up to her to make her understand that that did not make sense. Instantly she smiled and said ""Oh yeah we can do that no problem,"" and never came back, of course. We had to ask someone else for our bill so we could get out of this hell hole. I would never come back even if you paid me, it was a waste of my time and energy. Honestly you can make pretty much everything on that menu in your own kitchen, so there's no point.

2,1/19/2018,"The Mercer Kitchen is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of soho.  It's set in the garden level of the building, so once you enter you head downstairs in to this spacious warm environment.  Sadly this was the best part of the meal.  The food was very expensive for the quality (nothing was outstanding).  Portions were not generous either and I do not have a big appetite.  I ordered the seafood platter, which despite being $54 was very small.  It barely constituted an appetizer.  For dinner I had the ribeye, which was cooked well but was actually a bit flavorless.  Service was only OK, being quite slow (20+ min to get a drink order back).  We arrived at 7:15 and didn't get done with dinner until 11:00, pretty slow stuff.Overall the dinner cost $300 for two entrees, one appetizer, one dessert and three drinks.  For the quality I'd expect to pay half that in NYC.",0,0,0,Alex R.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,50,0

I was not going to bring the issue up initially, but the waiter could tell I was shocked and asked me if there was an issue. I was going to say something, but he literally walked away mid sentence, completely ignoring me. I have never seen such a horrid reaction customer service wise. I live in the city and have never seen a coffee beverage cost that much. Even those trendy places that emblazon cappuccino foam with unicorn designs and Beyoncé's face cost less than that. Liquid gold better be in that coffee. Chef Jean-Georges' tears and sweat better be the full bodied foam on that coffee.

The flavors on everything was spot on. The meats on the entrees were cooked perfectly. Very tasty and worth going back for another meal.

My husband walked back in after we walked out and spoke to a female blonde manager and asked if we weren't sat down due to his gender preference and portly size. While she said this was untrue, the whole face control and profiling was very true. There was no reason we shouldn't have had the opportunity to sit down when there was open tables. It was disgusting and this restaurant has no class, together with an attitude. Just to mention we are pretty well off, so it's a loss for them. So horrendous I was appalled.

I've been here numerous times through the years but she was the best.This place still remains popular among both tourists and locals. The food isn't innovative but it doesn't claim to be and it will please a mixed crowd. Last night I had the burger for the first time and i was slightly surprised at how good it was. Umami all around.  Fries were plentiful but came out cold. Seafood tower was good and fairly portioned. There are a handful of *super* low, uncomfortable tables right down the steps. If I were a five year old playing house I would have been psyched to sit here but unfortunately I'm a grownup paying $17 for cocktails. These tables have no business being here for anything other than a quick drink. The bussing staff was ultra aggressive in clearing things to the point it was annoying. We had just finished a glass of Champagne and gotten our wine glasses for the bottle with dinner and someone started taking the wine glasses away. We still had food on our appetizer plates and they tried to remove them. Lots of awkward hovering.  The desserts are basic but again, crowdpleasers. E.g. Valrhona chocolate cake.  The people watching is fun.

Not kidding. For the soup alone I give it 4 stars. The interior is fabulous, it's just annoying to eat upstairs and by the door. (Especially if you do in the winter like I did. You'll freeze your ass off) If you dine downstairs it may be better. (That's if you don't mind it being VERY dark) I was also impressed by those bathrooms...

The place is impressive. Large room, very trendy, elegant and aesthetically quite pleasing and given the long history and popularity my friends and I were all excited. Service was at best mediocre. Staff was unattentive, uninterested and it almost seemed like we were a burden just being there; at one point I raised my hand as a waiter walked by who looked right at me and continued walking by. We ordered 3 appetizers for the table that they seemed to not know how to put on the table (we were 6, big table) so decided the meats and cheese plate that comes with sides of nuts/cornichons/spice should be placed sort of in front of me but the side plate right in front of me (yes, it's a detail, but this is supposed to be a nice restaurant). We said sharing, no individual plates were given, we used the bread plates which no one seemed to notice or care about. It took a good 20 min to get out drinks. Bloodymary: awful, probably the worst I have had in 10 years in NYC. It was like the cocktail sauce you get with shrimp and I seemed like a crazy person to the waiter when I asked for olives...I sent it back, again no one noticed. To the food: very small portions. Eggs benedict were tiny, sauce was thick and you could tel was sitting under a lamp for a while, the 8 mini potatoes on the side are suggestive of ""we are too cheap to give you a normal portion"". No one checked in with us when the food came nor did anyone say bye and thank you as we were leaving.

After taking our order, we did not see our waiter again, and had to on numerous occasions flag down other servers to tend to our table.  I think the most frustrating part of our lunch was that entrees were brought out before any server came by to clear the table (plates and utensils) from our appetizers. No one checked to see if the food was to our liking, or if we needed anything else.  Also, there should be someone coming by to check to fill up water glasses. This did not happen.

I don't typically drink bourbon, but their blueberry bourbon drink was amazing, as well as their passionfruit whiskey fizz. The bill at the table in total was a tiny bit over $200 for 3 people... whoa. But we did get an insane amount of food (2 apps, 2 restaurant week, 1 $50/$55 entree, and 2 drinks). They sat us at a corner seat, which was really nice. Service was only good because they checked up on us (it's really sad that I'm used to servers not checking up on me that it's considered ""good"" if they do at least one table touch lol). There was a new server training who was nice and I wish him the best of luck! The server we had didn't take orders with a notepad, and it was weird because we did order a lot, and she did forget something. But it's ok.

4,6/18/2017,"I was surprised to discover after dining here that this was part of Michelin-star chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's culinary dynasty because by sheer coincidence, Jamie W. and I had just dined at Jean-Georges the day before (review: bit.ly/2rte9Z5). Now before you start rumors about me being so fancy schmancy, I have to admit I selected this place for an after-show dinner because they had a menu that appeared in tune with the dietary restrictions we were putting ourselves through in order to get healthier. In fact, we walked all the way from the Palace Theater in the heart of Times Square to this central SoHo location, so we could amp up our FitBit steps. When we approached among the stylish warehouse storefronts on Prince Street, we noticed there was no prominent signage, just some subtle lettering on the window that said this must be the place (photo: bit.ly/2sHcYtt). It appeared to be split into two levels as we saw the bar and what looked to be a private dining area when we entered the premises. I figured out that we needed to go downstairs to see the expressionless hostess about our reservation. Unlike Jean-Georges, it was dark industrial-chic with very low-level lighting and brick walls illuminated by floor lights (photo: bit.ly/2rEPS6w). An expansive dining room and a more casual bar took up the space downstairs.We were unfortunately seated next to a loud Italian family who looked like they were eating at home with a lot of broad hand gestures and sharp-tongued Italian shouting. We started by sharing the $16 Organic Shaved Fennel Salad with Arugula, Shaved Parmesan, and Mushroom (photo: bit.ly/2seQZsg). I believe there was just a light lemon vinaigrette coated on it, and it was just what we wanted. We also ordered the $10 Steamed Vegetables, which were mainly zucchini and yellow squash slices with baby carrots but again just what we wanted to have to eat right (photo: bit.ly/2sf6pwu). Our entrees came next, and we both went with fish.Jamie ordered the $30 Slowly Baked Salmon, a good-size filet sitting on top of Mashed Potatoes, Sugar Snap Peas, Fresh Dill, and Mixed Greens and drizzled with Black Truffle Vinaigrette (photo: bit.ly/2tBI4z5). It was genuinely flavorful with the salmon particularly moist and tender with a slight crust. I had the $26 Steamed Hake beautifully presented with Tarragon, Sesame Seeds, and Green and Yellow Wax Beans (photo: bit.ly/2tBRAlP). There was a bit of rice and a soy-like sauce, both of which enhanced the flavor considerably. Other than the loud Italians and the glum staff, we enjoyed the dining experience here. Merci encore, Jean-Georges.FOOD - 4 stars...Jean-Georges strikes again, not quite as unique but genuinely satisfyingAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...so SoHo, so rustically chicSERVICE - 3 stars...efficient but unsmiling, coolishTOTAL - 4 stars...stylish surroundings for such healthy eats",11,7,13,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

Not a big deal, we asked to hostess to seat us anyway, even if they came back to set it up, and she agreed.Then some kind of supervisor/ manager comes in and asks us why were seating, with a really bitchy attitude. I said we were just seated, and she said they don't seat people until its set up and if we could please get up? I said no, we asked to be seated and hostess agreed. She said, ""I don't believe so"", I asked, what? She said I don't believe my hostess would do that. I repeated what I had just said, and she just left.

You can drop the attitude."" The host working the ground floor main entrance is one of those hybrid-homos who simultaneously thinks he's too good for you yet is awful enough to stick around long enough to get some sassy zingers in to let you know that he thinks he's too good for you. I'm a member of the Friends of Kathy Griffin (is she still a thing) tribe, so let's be clear this is not a discrimination on that front. Case in point when I showed up for a mid-day meeting and he mumbled unintelligibly (if this were a BRAVO show, he'd be subtitled until the producers asked him to get out of the shot because why bother) ""I can't seat you until everyone in your party is here"" before cold shouldering me - and.. my party is a total of 2 people so it's not like a ""we need to get the table ready"" or ""there's a wait!"" situation... and they also don't have a waiting area (I think it may be because ... NO ONE IS THERE) so I'm literally standing next to empty tables in a space that has maybe 5 occupants in total who all look like different versions of hedge fund widows who spend their days buying items that are grey. Not wanting to awkwardly stand around there, I head out until the other person arrives and that's when I realized they had an entire lobby that anyone could wait in but apparently hybrid-homo didn't care to inform me. In fact he couldn't even be bothered to direct me to the lobby where I told him my friend was waiting. He just gave me a ""you again, are you lost?"" look that I naively interpreted as him wanting to know what my friend looked like so he could connect us. So I described her noting that she's about 6' tall as a distinctive feature, and he gives me a ""WHY ARE YOU CONTINUING TO EXIST"" look before saying ""Ugh that's like everyone"" - which manages to simultaneously be 1) unhelpful 2) untrue 3) unkind, what an accomplishment. Related note: he's about 5' 8"", but would totally be the type to write 5' 10"" on his modeling profile, cause YOU KNOW he's also a ""model"".The people downstairs where we actually ate were quite friendly and accommodating. I think their manager is an Asian girl with a bold red lip, aka my spirit animal. The food was good, though nothing special, and the pricing was about $20 for a bowl of soup. That might be expected at a stuffy UES place but I felt like I was eating in the corner of a dark basement. The best part of this experience was finishing the meeting and heading out. The host was such a major downer, even on it's own strength - the menu/food didn't provide the value to make it worthwhile for another visit, the organization/layout was clumsy and confusing. But the menu/food can be changed, the host will most definitely change, floorplans/flow can be reworked, the location though - is fantastic, as of right now: what a waste.",1,1,1,E J.,"New York, NY",4,23,0

The salmon I ordered was too buttery, and the staff isn't as coordinated.I don't have too many complaints for dinner but brunch time is always a mess. I understand that brunch is difficult to juggle, but you end up waiting an hour for small slabs of avocado on not toasted bread that costs $23.

1,2/20/2017,"I normally don't write reviews, but the experience at Mercer Kitchen was so terrible that I felt compelled to share. I had reservations here on Saturday for a birthday dinner and wasn't seated until an hour later. Once we were finally seated, the management tried to smooth things over by giving us complimentary appetizers. This gesture was appreciated and I was hoping the rest of the experience would have improved, but it just continued to go downhill. We waited for over 30 minutes for someone to take our drink orders. When we received our meals two of my friends ordered the skate and the cod fish, but they were both given the sea bass. They informed the wait staff of this error and the wait staff seemed confused, so we informed the manager. The manager told us that they ran out of both the cod and skate fish so they replaced the dishes with the sea bass! First off, we should have been informed that the dishes we ordered were not available. Secondly, we should have been giving the opportunity to select another dish. Instead, the staff at a Mercer Kitchen tried to sneak my friends dishes they did not order! What an insult!! My friends ended up ordering the burger which seemed to be one of the better entrees. Other dishes were not executed well - the salmon was too salty, the lamb was dry and somehow Mercer Kitchen ran out of dough for pizza so my friends who ordered this had to wait even longer!The service at Mercer was incompetent at best. The managers were nonchalant about the disastrous service, which leads me to believe that this service is the norm for them. I will never return to Mercer Kitchen and do not recommend it, which is unfortunate because I have been to other Jean George restaurants, where the food and service were impeccable.

I was pleasantly surprised by the dish. The fish had a nice buttery taste with a good sauce and seasame seeds that added an extra level of flavor. My boyfriend got the burger with fries which he enjoyed. We also got a side of mac and cheese (mistakenly, had asked for the mashed potatoes) and brussel sprouts. The sprouts I really liked and it was presented with just pieces of the leaves so it was super soft. The mac and cheese wasn't bad but definitely don't order it.

2,2/18/2017,"Where do I begin? I came here with my boyfriend, my boyfriend's friend and my cousin for a friday night dinner and we were all disappointed by the service and lack of operational efficiency. Despite attempts by management to fix their mistakes, they never really made up for all the mess they created.On the plus side and the only reason it's getting 2 stars, the food is actually very good. Everything we ordered was well executed, so at least the chef is doing something right.We had an 8:30 reservation and we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. Everyone was apologetic about the wait and when we finally sat down, a few minutes later someone brought us a pizza with compliments. When we got our bill at the end of the night, we saw that the first thing on the bill was the pizza, I mean seriously? We didn't even order the pizza and it came out on the house and you're going to charge us for it after everything else that went wrong?It took 30 minutes for our drinks to come after we had complained, and they didn't come until we were done with our appetizers. We ordered our second round of drinks shortly thereafter so we'd at least have them for our main courses. Well it still took about 15 minutes for our drinks to come out again.For appetizers, we ordered the sea bass carpaccio, salmon on crispy rice, tuna spring roll and burrata. We told the server that my boyfriend has a gluten allergy (celiac) and he said everything except the spring roll was gluten free. Great! Well, not so great. The salmon crispy rice comes out and there's definitely some sort of soy on it.At this point a manager has gotten involved and he apologizes and notes that the salmon is not gluten free. Not a big deal, but would've been nice to know. We specifically tell him, okay at this point we're not sure what is gluten free and we flagged that my boyfriend had ordered the lamb for his entree so to make sure that it comes out gluten free. He also says that they have gluten free bread he'll send out for us. Well that's nice, it would've been nice to have known and have had the server offer it to us at the beginning. Well when we got the bill, there was a $2 charge for bread sticks on our bill. Seriously? First of all gluten free bread is not breadsticks, and secondly if you are going to charge us for gluten free bread, don't offer it like it's free.For our main courses, my cousin and I shared the burger because we weren't that hungry anymore, and my boyfriend and his friend ordered the lobster. About 10 minutes after we ordered the mains, the server came back and said that they were out of lobster. It was 9:30 on a Friday night.When the main courses came out, they didn't have silverware on the table, and we had to ask for it. The lamb came with a side of what looked like deep fried onions and they had told us previously that they don't have a separate fryer. We flagged the manager down again and he said I am 90% sure these are gluten free, and he also had the nerve to tell us that it turned out the salmon was gluten free because the chef had used gluten free soy/ponzu sauce and a different wrapper for the rice. Hmm, why should we believe you? Do you want to know why we don't believe you? Because when we ask you to be 100% sure that the onions were gluten free, you said you'd confirm and come back to us. Well the manager comes back and abashedly notes that he can't guarantee they're gluten free and takes them away.At this point the manger acknowledges that things have been a disaster and ""wants to make things right."" So we are offered free dessert and again they forgot silverware until we asked for it. But at least this time the dessert was gluten free, and whatever the butterscotch dessert is, is heavenly.My boyfriend was in the bathroom when the desserts came out and the manager asked in a tone that indicated the items we would request would be on the house, ""is there anything else I can offer for you coffee, tea, after dinner drinks."" We asked for another butterscotch dessert. When they brought out the bill, the dessert was on there!Right before we asked for the bill, the manager once again offers if he could do anything else for us. So, with his insistence, we ordered 2 espressos and a shot of patron. You guessed it, these were on the bill too! They ultimately corrected the bill, and so we paid, but then when we looked at the bill closer right before we left, we realized that they over charged us by a drink and none of the drinks that were on there were ones we actually ordered. Since we assume the price of drinks are all about the same, this probably was only a $10 over charge, but on top of everything else that went wrong it was the icing on the cake.Management needs to get their act together. The food is good, but that's about it. If they try to make things right for a customer, don't end up charging them for the items at the end of the night. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back.",5,5,3,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

1,2/5/2017,"My experience at Mercer Kitchen was extremely disappointing, poorly handled, and quite frankly significantly below what I expected from a Jean-Georges establishment. Despite having emailed management with my complaints over a week ago, I still have not received a response.I made a reservation at Mercer Kitchen with the intention of enjoying the restaurant week Sunday dinner menu. Given that both the website and the official NYC restaurant week website assured us that Sunday dinner was offered, my friend and I fully expected to receive the restaurant week menu when we were led to our table. However, the restaurant week menu was not available. The waitress informed us that the website was incorrect, and that restaurant week was not offered on Sunday. Although we showed her the website which clearly indicated otherwise, she insisted that there was no restaurant week menu and that we were confusing The Mercer Kitchen downtown with the ones midtown and uptown. The website clearly indicated that it was the downtown Mercer Kitchen (i.e. the one we were at); however, we let it go. After we paid for our meal, we mentioned to the hostess on our way out that the website was incorrect, as we wanted to make sure the misinformation would be corrected in the best interest of future diners. At that point, the hostess said that the restaurant week menu actually was available, and there had been a mistake in the kitchen earlier. Apparently the kitchen believed they did not have the ingredients for restaurant week available. The hostess had just finished printing off the restaurant week menus that would be available from that point onward. Naturally, we were quite disappointed, given that we had come expressly for the restaurant week menu. The revelation indicated to us that our waitress was not providing us with the full information (i.e. that the kitchen had a mix-up), and furthermore we had to pay more for a lesser meal than we had been planning to that night. Although the hostess apologized, she did not offer to seek her manager and generally was not very courteous toward our complaint.

We showed up around 8:15pm and were told to wait promptly at the bar, which we did.The bar is fabulous and the bartenders at Mercer Kitchen are so kind and great at what they do.

According to the hostess, no one would get up from their tables after they had paid the check. Aggravating.Once we were finally seated we were handed the restaurant week menu which had a large array of choices. My boyfriend and I got something different for each of our courses. This allowed us to really taste everything they had to offer.The food was superb. I wouldn't expect bad food from a Jean-Georges restaurant.

2,1/19/2017,"I visited Mercer Kitchen last night with clients and was extremely disappointed with the service. So much so, that I don't think I'd ever go back--despite the food being pretty delicious. The last time these clients were in town, we took them to ABC Kitchen, and they loved it, so we thought Mercer Kitchen would be a great bet. Sadly, our waitress was too enamored by B-list celebrity, Jaden Smith and his entourage, who were sitting behind us, to pay any sort of attention to our table. Our drinks took forever to arrive and came out one at a time. When you are entertaining clients, that starts to get uncomfortable. After ordering a round of appetizers, we realized we needed more, so we asked our waitress if we could put in another order, and we got a cold and abrupt reply that we had to wait until she finished putting the drink order in for the other table. This took her nearly 10 minutes and then she disappeared--knowing well that we wanted to order more food. We asked our busboy if someone else could help us order more appetizers and he said no, that only our waitress could help. Another waitress who saw that we were getting impatient (only half the table was eating) came over and very nicely assured us we could order more food, but before she could say anything else, our waitress finally came back. By that time, our clients were ready to order their main course and it was too late. This waitress needs to be trained in etiquette and costumer service. By our repeated requests to her and her busboy, she should have sensed our urgency and been a little nicer and more accommodating--or at least apologetic. I'm surprised her disposition would be tolerated at such a high profile establishment. But now that I've read other reviews, I can't say that I'm surprised. I won't even discuss the food, which I already mentioned was pretty great, as the service put a dark cloud over our experience.",1,0,1,Jennifer L.,"New York, NY",22,39,4

It failed on both counts; not to mention the sub-standard service.  I was utterly stunned at the incompetence of the entire wait staff that tended to us. It easily took 30 minutes to receive any acknowledgement at our table to even order a drink. But what was most surprising was when 2 waiters came with 2 bottles of red wine saying it was a surprise for us since we were there for my friends birthday. While we tried to figure out who was the generous soul, the bottles were silently removed from our table without explanation. We just stared at one another in disbelief. We confirmed later that the waiters made a mistake and it was intended for the table next to us. While mistakes happen, wouldn't an average restaurant be too embarrassed to take the wine back?!? WOW....it gets worse.  Then my friend had to finally find a waiter to request that we order   However instead of taking our food orders, he finally took our drink orders. Then 2 minutes later another waiter came for our drink orders again. At this point my friend had to request he take our food requests.  By this point I am completely dumbfounded. But at least the food is supposed to be great, right?  Think again... then another waiter brings 4 huge appetizers to the table. I look at my friends. They are just laughing at this point. Is this a joke?  I had to inform the waiter these are not for us and he must be mistaken. After this disastrous evening, we just wanted to leave.   But we couldn't find our waiter for over 30 minutes   We had to hunt him down for the check. NEVER WILL I EVER!!!

3,12/26/2016,"Located in the heart of SoHo is one of Jean Georges Vongerichten's often overlooked restaurants: Mercer Kitchen. Housed in the basement level of Mercer Hotel, it's a ever-busy venue that caters both to hotel guests as well as the substantial nightlife crowd. The venue is chic and modern, offering a functional bar area and several communal tables, in addition to plenty of two-tops that are smartly arranged across the room, making it ideal for a number of group sizes and occasions. I came to get a late dinner with a friend one evening, and was grateful upon entering that I had made a reservation in advance; nearly every seat at the bar and chair in the dining room table was occupied.The menu here is more traditionally ""American"" than you would find at some of JGV's other restaurants. I have to admit that I missed seeing some of the more Asian-influenced dishes, but we were easily able to make our choices across several categories. If possible, I would recommend ordering the signature Salmon Sashimi, which takes six pieces of fresh salmon and layers them over rectangular blocks of crispy sushi rice. The additional texture and crunch in the pressed rice works surprisingly well in each bite, and the layering of a spicy mayo and ponzu round out the flavors.As for the mains, I couldn't help but order the Mercer Kitchen Burger, which takes a griddled beef patty and tops it with pepperjack cheese, sliced avocado, red onions, and a sweet-savory Russian dressing. It's sandwiched between two brioche bun halves and served with a generous side of french fries. I was a little disappointed to find that it had been cooked past my requested medium rare, but the beef had been well seasoned and the additional components worked to make for a satisfactory bite. And for dessert? JGV's classic Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake won't disappoint, and even for somene like myself who doesn't enjoy chocolate most of the time, I couldn't help but delight in how deliciously the warm, melted interior of the cake paired with the scoop of cold vanilla ice cream.There are, unfortunately, a few downfalls we experienced at this restaurant. We waited upwards of half an hour between our appetizer and main courses, and our server wasn't the most attentive in keeping us informed of the status in the kitchen. The fact that the venue is entirely underground and is usually packed also makes the average volume in here quite high; you may struggle like we did to have a coherent conversation. And, yes, given the location and clientele that the restaurant caters too, prices are on the higher end of the spectrum, so come prepared to do a little damage to your wallet.At the end of the day, Mercer Kitchen didn't disappoint per se, but neither did it offer much incentive for us to return. If you're in the area and in need of a more upscale venue to visit, it will certainly fit the bill - but for me, one visit is sufficient.",5,3,3,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

The place was just as busy as you'd expect at noon on a Christmas season Saturday, so a table four four in the trendy/dim/exposed brick downstairs section had an hour wait.

Pear Aperol cocktail, Bloody Mary, Dark & Stormy, and G&T - good lookin' team. Staff was comfortingly professional and pleasant. Dad awkwardly told our waitress she had Cameron Diaz's smile. The bread (served with YUMMY olivwas burnt on the outside which I LOVED. I ordered the lamb sandwich, which was absolutely perfect, top to bottom - perfectly crunchy bread, arugula, roasted reds, and a green aioli. I will think of this sandwich forever. Side of yummy, tiny (thinkMcDonald's-looking) fries. Sam's turkey burger, with red peps also, was ""PHENOMINAL"", which I agreed with. Loved his fries too. Dad loved his fish n chips. His only complaint was that his glass was too big for his pour (bottled - lol great job dad). Lisa liked her marg 'za, and we both liked our Cab. My only complaint was the 10 min wait for the women's bathroom. But that's the vicious cycle you have to concede to if you want drinks that good.

1,12/4/2016,Went to mercer kitchen for dinner last night with a friend. When we arrived at 945pm we were told to wait at the bar for 10 minutes until our table was ready. We enjoyed some wine and chatted until the hostess came over to lead us to our table. We were able to sit in a nice corner table and we were offered water and bread immediately. The waitress came over and took our food order. I asked to see the wine menu and picked out a bottle of white. Our appetizer arrived immediately along with the wine. Everything was enjoyable. However- that was the last time we saw our waitress. My wine glass sat empty for the next hour. The bus boy ended up pouring our wine and clearing our meal. We were never offered dessert or coffee. When the check finally came I asked to speak to the general manager. He came over and gave us his card. Promised it would never happen again and promptly left. Still no check. We waiting another 30 minutes and considered just leaving- however I would never do that and felt horrible for the bus boys. I saw another manager and called him over. Explained the whole story again and he provides me with a bill with everything on it! No drink offer or dessert. No apology. I told him to adjust the price and he claimed he took off champagne and cocktails?!? Clearly no one knew what was going on. Needless to say it was 1 am by the time we got out of there.

3,9/13/2016,"I tried not to have high expectations for one of Jean Georges restaurant because high expectations often leads to disappointment. Around the area and spontaneously decided to come here for lunch. The ambiance throughout the restaurant was very chic. The main dining area is actually downstairs. As I checked out the menus, nothing really appealed to me as everything seemed typical. They participate for restaurant week lunch as well. (Not sure about dinner) I really had no idea what to order so I decided to just keep it simple with some appetizers, a salad and a pizza off the ALC menu. The entrees and sides did not appeal to me. I had some raw seafood and I just wished the runner or server had came over to let me know what kind of oysters I was having, it matters. Even so, the oysters and clams were very fresh and satisfying. I highly recommend the crispy rice salmon sushi appetizer with the chipotle mayo and ponzu sauce, amazing combination right there. The server recommended the shrimp salad which sounded basic but I trusted her. I had my dressings on the side just in case I don't like it. Don't kill me if I say I don't like champagne, but I really don't so I was hesitant to try it. Let's just say, the champagne vinaigrette (it's creamy), was one of the best dressings I have ever had. The truffle dressing fell short though, what a disappointment. I love truffle, black truffle, white truffle, love it all so no doubt I was going to get the black truffle and fontina cheese pizza. It was a tad bit too oily, came in four slices and just perfect for sharing. Overall, the service was standard, and I would definitely enjoy lunch here if I'm around the Soho area.",2,1,1,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",546,336,2421

My friend and I walked downstairs to get a table and were not greeted with any kindness whatsoever. Rather, the hostesses were very smug and almost condescending. They told us the wait would be about 20 minutes and to go have a seat at the bar and that's what we did. Because there were two seats available, we decided to forgo the table and eat at the bar. We sat at the bar for at least 25 minutes and neither of the two bartenders ever came to take our drink order or drop off menus. There was no acknowledgement of any kind, not even a nod. We just didn't exist, so we gave up and walked out. I am usually very patient at restaurants because I know the stress the staff has, but this was just plain rude.

About a week ago my wife and myself with long time family friend were excited to have a wonderful time in this place. The food was ok but the waiter was awful in terms of serving. Basically he was not interested in serving people as he supposed to do in this kind of famous restaurant. Whenever we needed to order more food and drinks we had to ask the other staffs because he was not around our table. The highlight of awful service was the bill. We found there was a charge for the dish we did not order. I tried to show and explain but he did not even take a look at the bill like he already knew about it. I finally complained about poor service and wrong charge but he complained about my complain with saying ""You can't treat me like that because I am covering 5tables and human being"" rather than he apologized.

For the first course, we ordered the beet salad and the pizza with spinach. Both were delicious but the pizza was surprisingly outstanding. For the entrée, I had the chicken with lemon with balsamic radicchio and my boyfriend had the steamed skate which were both very mediocre. The radicchio was very acidic and bitter - barely ate more than 1 bite. For dessert, we tried both options and again the dishes were average but satisfactory.

They are kids so they were ok with anything. The options were awful. Not even close to the dinner menu. After fries and ""pizza"" I asked our waiter if we could order something off the dinner menu as it was now 5:20pm.

Thankfully, the food is pretty awesome too, and it's a great spot to impress a date with a fancy dinner. While the upstairs is more bar-oriented, downstairs is super chic, with low lighting, candles, and a modern rustic decor.I've only ever been here late nights when the restaurant is nearly empty, but this has never detracted from our food or service. We always start with the tuna spring roll, which is lightly seared tuna in an eggroll wrapper, served with a really delicious soybean puree. It also comes with a super spicy sauce with a wasabi kick, which I avoid every time.For mains, the salmon with corn pudding and cherry tomatoes in a light vinaigrette was especially tasty. It's a smallish portion, but super rich and perfectly cooked to medium. I've also had the steamed skate with sushi rice and broccoli, and while I didn't enjoy it as much as the salmon, it's a good light option.I've never had dessert, but they have plenty of great drinks, including a really refreshing cucumber martini. The service is also always fantastic, albeit very formal.

I also realize that sometimes ambience or location are going to add to the overall expense but again, as long as it's not egregious, I'm generally happy. Ordered a yogurt parfait with fresh fruit compote and granola. Now, I understand that I'm in Soho. I also understand that I'm sitting in a beautiful restaurant among equally beautiful people but $15 for literally 4 ounces of yogurt with some stuff on it is obscene. Same with the $19 piece of Burrata mozzarella, $19 waffle and $15 for a few very average muffins.  Manhattan is not without spectacular brunch locations. The vast majority offer either decent food at acceptable prices or excellent food at ridiculous prices. I'm not sure if the former quality at the latter price will be a compelling reason for me to return to Mercer Kitchen.

3,7/4/2016,Came here on a Friday night with a group of 5. The cocktail menu was interesting. I ordered a rhubarb concoction and either it wasn't made right or the flavors got lost in the making and did not match the description. We ordered the Salmon sashimi and the truffle fontina cheese pizza as apps. The salmon sashimi was tasty. The contrast in textures and temps were creative and exciting. Pizza was good too but I didn't taste much truffle. As the main we all ordered the salmon entree except my husband ordered the fettuccine. Pasta was made fresh and so good. The salmon was a let down because the server described it as a savory dish; came with a small piece of salmon with a corn pudding that was so sweet. Not the least bit savory and not what I was in the mood for. Server was a bit of a novice. He didn't know much about the menu. He was pre-occupied with cleaning up the bar and going home.

With exposed brick walls, wood plank ceilings, and industrial lighting fixtures, expect to sit aside of celebs and fellow New Yorkers at long, sleek communal tables.  This is a definitely one of those establishments where you go to be seen during prime dinner hours.While the atmosphere and vibe are a big part of what makes this place so special, the diversity of the menu is the icing on the cake.  With a clear American influence, the dinner menu ranges from pizza, to burgers, to fettuccine, to red snapper and maine lobster.  That said, the rigatoni with meatballs (and smoked chili ragu) is a personal favorite, while the Mercer burger remains a clear local favorite.  That said, even with such a diverse menu, everything on the menu is exceptionally well made and beautifully presented.  The cocktail menu is equally as diverse, with an awesome lineup of signature cocktails (the ginger margarita will spot on). Of course, being a Jean-Georges restaurant, the service is usually very hospitable and fast.  Be sure to get a reservation for Thursday/Friday/Saturday night dinner as tables are highly coveted. Most cocktails are priced in the $15 range, with the majority of entrees priced in the $25-40 range (note that most of the fish/meat dishes are big enough to be shared).Be sure to check out the breakfast and lunch (served at the cafe upstairs) for a quick and more casual bite as well.",1,0,0,Matt K.,"New York, NY",262,93,22

The place itself is nice enough considering it is in a basement, but the compliments stop there. The waiter was completely inattentive and even worse, rude. He was nowhere to be found when we were seated and then just came over and said, ""Are you ready to order?"" The sweet pea soup had to go back, because it literally tasted rancid, perhaps like cleaning fluid. It had a similar odor. The organic kale salad was unimpressive. The mozzarella pizza had no taste and bitter tomato sauce. The roast chicken was dried out and also lacked any flavor whatsoever. The salmon was fair, but again unimpressive. The ""side"" of sautéed 7 grains was inedible. My guess is that bird food tastes better. Towards the end of this overpriced, disappointing dinner, the manager came over to ask how everything was. Well, let's just say she heard an earful, but again, she fell short just like everything else. Instead of taking off something from the check, she sent over a decent carrot cake.

3,5/12/2016,"When you go to a place like Mercer Kitchen you have certain expectations surrounding the food and service. It is expected you are going to be spending a decent amount on dinner and with that you expect good food and good service. I went there for dinner at 8:30 on a Tuesday night. It was busier than I expected it to be, but not overwhelmingly busy. I was there with a friend and we each ordered an appetizer and a main course. About 5 minutes after putting in our orders someone comes out to serve me both my appetizer and main course...At the same time?! My friend on the other hand didn't get any food at all. I refused the main course as I did not ask for things to be brought out together. It bothered me as the server made me feel as if I had done something wrong refusing this. Close to 10 minutes later my friend got his salad. Don't ask me why it took so long to make a salad. After that our main courses came and the food was good. He had the pork chop and I had the bass. However, after we ate, it took a very long time for our plates to be cleared. Also our waters were rarely filled and left empty most of the time. Honestly, there was nothing about the service that was terrible. It was just a lot of little stuff that really took away from the dining experience. If you are going to charge $16 for an appetizer and almost $40 for a main dish, then that food should be timed properly and your water should be filled.

3,5/6/2016,"What a shame...now, where to begin? A group of friends came to MK for a nice weekend dinner. A good thing. This place is so massive they tend to have reservations open last minute, unlike many other neighborhood eateries. After reading other reviews on Yelp I think I was prepared to lower my standards, and quite frankly it met and maybe even exceeded them. But that's not saying much, also that's not enough for 5 stars. The staff was fine, gracious and attentive. No complaints on the wait and host staff. The food though was uninspired. Nothing made me want to go back for another bite. The chicken coconut soup was bitter and sour and didn't taste fresh. It may have been, but it doesn't really work together. We also tried the bruschetta. That was better, but uneven. The ends lacked the flavor the middle had. Basically the ends were just bread and too salty. For my main I got the bass. It was an odd cut of bass. Tiny! More like a cut of trout. The veggies underneath were allowed to shine but shine in the sense there was no flavor. My friend who ordered the same dish didn't finish his. He was just uninterested in it. Another friend had the salmon and said it seemed off or old. I doubt it was old, but maybe just not a great cut. Another had the lamb. That was actually pretty good. Now why do I give it three stars...the price point is off. It's far to expensive for what it is. Maybe in 2001 they could get away with this. But, food has come a long way since then. If they lowered the prices I would give it 4 stars, still not 5. They need to update the menu. Maybe a new chef?

1,4/29/2016,"Shame on Jean-Georges Vongerichten for allowing his name to be associated with this tired restaurant. When it opened 15-20 years ago, The Mercer Kitchen showcased New American with bright, bold flavors. Yes, it was a bit of a scene, but the food was the real star.Flash forward to a few days ago. Our party of three was treated to one of the most amateurish experiences in a restaurant that we have ever encountered.Our waiter was well-intentioned, but had no training. We had to ask for a wine list (he seem startled that we would not want cocktails), and remind him to take our wine order. I am somewhat impatient with restaurant wine lists that do not have good bottles for less than $100+. I believe it shows the restaurant's lack of interest in the diner's experience and the opportunity to showcase/discover a new vineyard.No matter. We ordered glasses of rose to start and a simple zin for our meal. More on the food later, but the rose came as we were finishing our starters. Shortly after our starter dishes were cleared (a whole experience unto itself -- see below), one of the hostesses came by with our Zinfandel. She proceeds to open the bottle, and before we can say a word, she pours a taste into my husband's USED rose glass. We protested, and she muttered something about there not being any ""red wine"" glasses that night (???). When we explained the issue was the fact the wine glasses on our table had already been used for a different wine, she disappeared for a while and returned with two piping hot white wine glasses, which she proceeded to fill with our Zinfandel. Further illustration of the contempt the restaurant has for its diners: little of interest on the wine list below $100, and then the staff destroys the wine by pouring it in hot glasses.Why didn't we complain? At this point, we had all settled back and decided to watch the train wreck of the dining room. The seat next to mine had a long cut in the upholstery and the chair stuffing was escaping. Another woman a seat over got her clothing stuck on gum that was left under the table. The theater went on...The starters were decidedly tasteless. The calamari with spicy sauce was served with bland sauce. The tuna rolls didn't have a particular flavor. The kale salad had an occasional slice of jalapeño -- which made it the best dish of the three. However, the best part was when the staff came to clear our plates, and began wiping his nose on his cuff -- reaching for more of our plates, and then wiping again. Truly one of the grossest things I have seen in a restaurant.We waited easily 25 minutes between our starters and main courses. Our server would come by occasionally to give us a thumb's up and tell us he would check on our food in the kitchen. When the main courses arrived, they were...fine. Nothing particularly unique or interesting, each was bland but not inedible. I had veal, which has breaded and fried and just a sad way to treat protein. I felt so badly that an animal died to be so tasteless that I had a momentary flirtation with vegetarianism.It is hard to keep quality strong over years in a restaurant. Gramercy Tavern has kept the quality and energy in the kitchen so the results continue to impress after 20 years. Even Babbo, which is ebbing from its peak, still has flashes of greatness and a professional floor staff.Jean-Georges Vongerichten is still parlaying his name as a quality chef into a stable of restaurants. Unfortunately, while he no doubt appreciates the financial benefits associated with lending his name to a restaurant menu, there seems to be little interest in following up with a quality experience.",3,1,0,ML P.,"Bethesda, MD",0,12,0

Wow, thanks for making such an effort. We ordered a bread basket (mediocre) to tide us over, and it's a good thing we did.

1,3/18/2016,"TERRIBLE! My girlfriends and I came here for dinner to start off a bachelorette weekend in the city. We had a large party, so they required that we sign a contract. They essentially forced us to choose from a pre fixe menu, which was only the beginning of our frustration. They quoted us $68/person for an appetizer, entree and dessert. It was then another $5/glass of wine. We originally had reservations for 8pm, which were changed to 9pm by the restaurant. We arrived shortly after 9 and our table was ready. After waiting almost 45 minutes, we were finally seated. Service wasn't the best; our waitress was borderline rude and the  busses barely spoke or seemed to understand English. As dinner progressed, the waitress continually topped off the wine glasses. As dinner progressed, we inquired as to what constituted a ""glass"" since none of the glasses of wine were even close to empty as they continued to fill them up. The answer given was vague, but when we received the check, we found out that they had charged $5 EVERY TIME they topped off a wine glass - not cool and totally not fair, especially since no one had asked for a refill. And I haven't even gotten to the food yet! While I was pleasantly surprised by the portions, the appetizer salads were drenched in dressing. The entrees were all around salty. The dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal - the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream was to die for! Our negotiated contract was supposed to include gratitude, but our check did not reflect that. We ended up paying $78 for the 3 courses WITHOUT alcohol after arguing with the manager for a good 10-15 minutes.

The service and staff were amazing...and at first I thought it was because I was having an exceptionally good hair day...but I quickly realized that everybody around me was enjoying the same incredible service. We ordered the Mercer Burger, pizza and the Baby Beets and Goat Cheese salad. We also ordered the home made sodas.  Everything was incredible and my only regret is that we ate everything and won't be taking any leftovers home.",2,1,1,Brian W.,"Houston, TX",225,25,21
4,3/16/2016,"An intimate, but trendy and cute date spot. An amazing part about our dinner was that we had our appetizers, entreé, and bill all in UNDER 1 HOUR! Very impressed with the expediting process. I had a reservation made at 7:45 PM for 2. My boyfriend and I arrived about 10 minutes early, but they were still able to seat us right away. We were seated by these tall tables (personally not a fan of) by the open kitchen, which was cool to see all the chefs in action. Service was good, waters were always filled by the attentive busboys, and our waitress Jannica was nice. Appetizers:Fried squid (calamari) dish - fluffly, light, and the foamy aioli was a great touch. There was also a fair balance of tentacles (which I love!). Portion size was also more than expected from a fairly upscale restaurant. Chicken and Cocunut Soup - Delicious! Incredibly savory. The consistency was creamy without being too thick. Highly recommend. It was a pretty decent-sized bowl too for an appetizer. A Dozen Oysters - all very clean and shucked well. I believe we had Blue Points, Island Creek (my favorite of the bunch), and a Mermaid one. Only gripe is that the were a bit pricey at $4 each.Entreé:Salmon with crusted Poppy Seeds and Summet Squash - a very pretty dish. Salmon was not dry at all; cooked with medium temperatureh. The vegetables were great with whatever sauce was on the dish. I've never seen fish with a poppy seed crust on top, but it worked well! Cool idea.Fish and Chips - The chips were moreso slices of roasted potatoes than crunchy fries. The fried fish tasted standard, but the batter was light and not greasy/oily at all, which was good.Cocktail:A Mckenzie rum mixed drink, which I felt was fairly strong. I thought the drink prices were fairly steep, but that could just be standard for the area.There is -1 star for the drink prices, the tall tables which I wasn't that big a fan of, and for our food runner that brought out our oysters - he did not tell us which oysters were what. We had to ask our waitress to identify the oysters for us. Although she did not know, she came back quickly and was able to tell us.",0,0,0,Natasha M.,"Fullerton, PA",160,5,3
3,3/14/2016,"This review is specifically aimed at my dining experience on March 7th.  I have been here many times and it is a favorite but my most recent visit definitely left things to be desired.We ordered the meat and cheese plate as an appetizer to share.  Once the server bought it out my friend asked what the plate consisted of.  He replied, meat and cheese.  Well, duh, we can read the menu item!  We asked for the waiter to be sent over so we could get a more specific answer.  To my great surprise, he did not know what was on the plate either (he said they had recently switched it up & he hadnt read the email?).  My friend then asked what the accompaniments were (as surely they remained the same) - once again he did not know. I could actually tell what it was just by looking (cornichons, pecans, mustard) - how could he not know what it was as someone who works in the restaurant industry? He said he would go and check with the kitchen and in the end the manager came over and even she did not know what kind of cheese they were serving.  I was honestly shocked that a jean georges restaurant would have this kind of service. We shared the truffle pizza which was OK but not amazing and did not live up to the hype of other reviews and then the chicken which previously has been excellent and my go to for the restaurant.  I feel this time it was just OK, slightly dry.  Mashed potato and beans were excellent though.  Perhaps they were having an off night but i will think twice before going back again even though i usually do enjoy it, dont want to take the risk they will again have an 'off night'.",0,0,0,Alex F.,"Manhattan, NY",323,13,2

I ordered the Benedict which was very tasty while and sipped on the Greenport IPA which was also very good. Lots of people watching and conversation was good enough for us. However, not sure if it was the of day (between 4 and 5) but the service was a little unfulfilling. We watched our first waitress wonder from table to table with our drinks before landing at ours and then over pouring on the table.

After, things started to go wrong. - Our server handed menus to us after 5 min we've been seated. - Water wasn't poured not for the following 15 min after we were ready to order and were waiting for the sever to come over.Food:- Crab fritters were not bad, sea bass was way too dry and salty. Salmon carpaccio and side of spaetzle that my boyfriend ordered were both not available!!! So he had to take a seafood plate (it was good, you can't spoil shrimp by just boiling it)..Service:- Busser was not clearing the table on time when were done with the dishes, they were rushed from the table in front of our faces when the new plates came out.- The ginger ale I ordered was forgotten at all, I had to wait until the main course to remind my waiter about it. She did not even apologized!- Empty cup from cappuccino was ignored for a while, busser just kept avoiding it until we ordered another cappuccino.- And eventually, when we asked for the check, there was not even a space to sign it, the table was clattered with empty plates and dishes.

You can get a lot of food and variety for a relatively fair price.5. Don't have high creativity expectations. It's pretty good for what the dish stands for.

When I'm paying $20+ dollars for a hamburger I want my artisanal, local,, high quality roll, with ya know a mere minimum of 9 grains, not just like white flour simplistic.

I had made a reservation for 4 people online and on the day of the reservation I came into the Mercer Kitchen to change it from 4 to 6 people. I spoke to the small bald man at the front of house who assured me that this was possible if I changed my reservation to 9.30.  So at 9.30 my party and I arrived and are greeted once again by the small bald headed man at the front desk. Once arriving however he tells me that my reservation is only for 5 and that I would have to wait as I did not reserve a big enough table. After I politely explained that he was in fact the one who made the reservation earlier that day he point blank lied to my face and claimed that he had never seen me before and tells me that I am wrong. He didn't not offer an apology and was extremely arrogant. As someone who has worked in the service industry I completely understand that sometimes reservations get messed up and it's really no big deal. I do however find lying and being rude to customers a very big deal! After waiting for about 25 minutes by the bar I approach the front of house and am told that it will be only another 5 minutes. Fast forward nearly 30 minutes later we are finally seated. Our waiter however was also sub par, he was very stressed and inexperienced. Our party also saw him picking his nose whilst putting in our order which is obviously totally gross!The only saving grace was the wonderful bar man who was extremely efficient and made wonderful cocktails!

The decor is cool with the brick and the mirrors, but there are umbrellas hanging from the ceiling that are clearly there to catch leaks (not appetizing). The food was good, but I would never pay full price for it. It wasn't better than anything I've had at much less expensive restaurants.For the appetizer, I had the truffle pizza. I did like this a lot and the dough is very airy with a nice amount of chewiness. It was pretty big, which was surprising for an appetizer. but nice. For my main course I had the burger, which was good but nothing crazy or inventive (just a cheeseburger), and the fries were almost like McDonald's quality. For dessert, I asked the server what she recommended, and she said the ""warm chocolate cake"" was the signature item and was so amazing but the pineapple upside down cake is the same as you can get anywhere else. I felt like both were the quality of items you could get anywhere else. The chocolate cake was good and clearly made with good chocolate, but let's get real--it was lava cake.

Entree:I got the pan roasted hake.The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce fit well with the dish. One improvement I suggest is that the Savoy Cabbage should be cooked a bit softer. Fish is very delicate and I love eating fish with vegetables that melts in my mouth.Dessert: I chose the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.The ice cream tasted really good, but I had better chocolate lava cake. The plate look beautiful, however this dish tasted way too sweet. Overall Experience:Servers (7/10):The servers were not rude, but they can be improved.I came to this restaurant with two other friends to enjoy our food while talking about our winter break. The servers asked us ""Hows the food?"" for every course that came out. I understand that they are being kind, but whenever they asked that question I was always being interrupted. Instead of asking about the food every plate that comes out, it would be way better to just ask at the end of the whole meal. Decor (9/10):The location is awesome and the restaurant itself looks amazing. I love how when you go down to the dining area you see the chefs working at their kitchen. One thing to improve: Should make the dining area brighter. It was hard to see what was on the menu because it was kind of dark.",1,0,0,Won Woo J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

2,1/27/2016,"I've been to Mercer Kitchen many times and it pains me to write a bad review, but last night was just too ridiculous. I had made a reservation on open table for 4 people at 8:00pm on the night before. Immediately after making the reservation the restaurant called to confirm it. When we showed up at 8 last night I was told that my reservation was only made for two people but if we went and had a drink at the bar he would get us seated as quickly as possible. After about 15min I went back to check on the eta and the maitre d' told me he'd come back and let me know in 3 min. I told him that someone had called to confirm and I showed him my open table confirmation. He said that there was nothing he could do. They were busy and the reservation only came in as 2 people.  He never came back to give me an ETA. After about 40 min I went back to ask again and this time there was a different gentleman there who said that I did have a reservation for 4 people at 8pm and there was a table ready now if I wanted it. I found the small bald man with glasses I had first spoken to and asked him about the mixup. Instead of apologizing and admitting a mistake he lied to my face and said that he knew I had a reservation for four, never said it was for two people, and me talking to him was delaying my table getting ready. We were then seated at a table which had been open THE ENTIRE TIME! Now, of course the food was fantastic as always and the table service was great, but the lead up to this meal left a bad taste in all our mouths. Tragically this place may have become too hip for it's own good and the small bald man at front of house has got to go. I would consider many other places in this neighborhood before returning.",1,1,0,Matt G.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,8,0

3,1/25/2016,"Made reservations through opentable for restaurant week. After having dined at Spice Market and Jean Georges in the Trump building I was a fan and I always wanted to check out The Mercer Kitchen.I had a 7:00pm dinner reservation and I called them to push it back to 8:30 pm. They couldn't seem to find the original reservation but were happy to make a new one. When we arrived we were greeted and sat down right away as there were plenty of available tables. Upon sitting, My boyfriend went to the restroom, I realized my menu did not have the restaurant week offer on it, when I inquired with the server  and they apologized for giving the wrong menu, correcting it.One thing to note: The menu that is on their website as RW 2016 is not the same menu that we were given. The choices on the menu we were given were a soup, salad, and pizza for apps. A choice of chicken milanese, burger, and a breaded white fish w/ mushrooms, dessert choices were chocolate cake and an almond cake with berries. We were never given a drink menu. Two different servers came by to ask us whether we would like tap, still or sparkling. But no one ever came by to take our drink order, We didn't notice until our first course arrived because I was taking antibiotics and haven't been drinking anyway for a few days but still surprising that a restaurant of this caliber would miss this important step. We ordered the pizza and baby lettuce salad. Salad was a salad, no complaints, the pizza was quite good. The mains were the fish and the burger both good.The desserts were probably the highlight along with the pizza, we ordered one of each kind. Another weird thing was that while we were waiting for our dessert course to arrive, a third server came by to ask us if we wanted any dessert. We told him we had already ordered. Then our desserts came with out our table being marked with any silverware. The silverware followed after as they noticed there was noting on the tables. To sum it all up:Food: Good Ambiance: Really niceService: Patchy, inconsistent serviceOverall I would probably give them another chance, maybe it was just a bad day but it was not busy.

2,1/23/2016,"Food: 3 starsService: 1 starCocktail: Surprisingly good (5 star)I came here during restaurant week on my birthday and the service was comedically awful.  The only thing that salvaged the evening, other than the good company and surprisingly good cocktails, was that the service and indeed the entire culture of management at the restaurant were so bizarre and ridiculous that we had a bunch of good laughs.  The hosts had a weird good cop/bad cop thing going on.  When I asked questions about the seating, one would say yes and the other would say no at the same time, to the point where it was really confusing.  We had about 3 waiters, none of them introduced themselves or said anything to us other than ""are you ready to order.""  One dude threw the bread basket and olive oil on the table.  Yep, just dropped it down and stomped away, at which point we all started laughing.  After about twenty minutes of sitting around, the waitress asked if we wanted any drinks, at which point we gingerly asked for the drink menus.  Later, when I asked her if she could hold the proscuitto, she gave me an inexplicable stink eye (also kind of funny).  Even though we all got restaurant week, they never put in our dessert order.  My friend literally had to walk into the kitchen to ask for our dessert after about 40 mins, at which point they seemed really surprised that we wanted dessert (hello, restaurant week menu!).  There were other bizarre instances of rudeness/negligence that I can't bother to write here. I found the food to be underwhelming.  The pizza had barely any mushroom on it, and in general the food seemed like it was prepared well in advance and had just been sitting around under heat lamps.  The skete was so-so.  But the rye passion fruit cocktail was delicious.  So there's that.",1,1,0,Aviva K.,"Manhattan, NY",122,12,0

1,1/19/2016,"When I read reviews about the service I should have listened. The service at Mercer Kitchen isn't just slow, it isn't just lackluster, its flat out unapologetically heinous. If you transported their waiters to a diner the service would still be remarkably bad. I don't know if someone has dropped the ball with monitoring this restaurant or if they're just hoping its popular enough for people to blindly praise it, but this place is bad enough that I'm honestly surprised it still has a crowd. We were going to be in the area and decided to give it a try, being frequent visitors to Jojos and Perry Street. Bad Decision.If you want decent brunch food you could get literally anywhere else, but enjoy comedically bad service, Mercer Kitchen is for you. Waited over 30 minutes past our reservation while the male host wandered around and chatted with another two hostesses. No apologies, no acknowledgement that there was a line of people trying to check in (let alone be seated) going completely up the stairs. No warning of how late the table would be, just a vague 'oh, the table will be ready soon' comment while he suggested we wait along with the mob of others waiting to be seated well after their reservations. Finally seated, ordered cocktails. Ordered food 10 minutes later, still without cocktails. Constantly disturbed by their very chatty, middle aged waitstaff, who apparently is unaware that work isn't actually a group cocktail hour. Food arrived more than 45 minutes after we'd ordered, with very basic errors (want them to leave a garnish off of your order? Good luck!). Still no drinks. Asked for the cocktails at least 5 times, no actual response from any of their servers (and there were many of them), no apologies even when we said we'd been waiting more than 45 minutes and were clearly halfway done with brunch. Cocktails finally arrived, badly  mixed and watered down. I believe it cost $14, while you could get many cheaper, actually decent cocktails within blocks. Took another 30 minutes to get the check, then more time to pay. If you're already making people wait more than a half hours for tables, maybe train your waitstaff not to walk past closed menus for 15 minutes, and not to walk passed credit cards standing up in the check. Several waiters (including our own) passed by, noted that we were clearly done and actively trying to pay and then wandered away. We're not just tucking credit cards into the check for fun, we'd actually like you to maybe do your job and run the cards, if you can fit it in between chilling with your friends. Honestly, the service is so below par that unless you're that invested in going somewhere 'famous' (and even then) you can get a much better meal elsewhere. I've been to most of Jean George's restaurants and the food is considerably better, and the service isn't a complete joke. You're better off spending your money elsewhere. Want good food? There are dozens of other great restaurants a block or two away. Want to see and be seen? There are dozens of other well known, impressively populated restaurants within a few blocks. Want abysmal service and food you could literally get at a diner? Mercer Kitchen is for you.",5,2,0,Claire B.,"South Kensington, London, United Kingdom",1,23,0

Came in on MLK day which happened to be the first day of restaurant week.  Waited 20 minutes  for our waiter to come over and take drink Order, and hour for our apps to be delivered and and hour and a half for lunch. Upon bringing lunch, the wrong meal was brought. Needless to say, all in we ran much later than anticipated and missed our movie. The waiter never came by to apologize in fact, the waiter came by after apps we finished  to ask if all of the apps were delivered.

3,1/16/2016,Giving this restaurant three stars solely for the food. It's been awhile since I've seen such bad service in a restaurant before. We had a party of eight and went in for lunch. It took over 20 mins each time we ordered another glass of wine. Our VP came in and ordered wine and again did not see it for over 20 mins. We also Initially ordered appetizers (3) personally placed by me. Again with drinks taking so long I assumed after 30 mins without our appetizers this was the standard here. Then our entrees Come out with no sign of appetizers and the server told me no one ordered them. Yes yes we did I did lol. Then suddenly less than 5 mins later all appetizers magically appeared. For $16 for 3 beets and half a teaspoon of goat cheese on a plate one would think the service would have been impeccable.

2,1/11/2016,"No longer a fun of this place. It has gone down the hill - let me tell you. 15 of us reserved to celebrate a birthday dinner of a very dear friend. The selection of the meat and cheese platters as an app was very poor, small quantities and nothing was refined or sophisticated as it should be, just cut and selected extremely poorly - I could have made the same dish at home buying my own stuff at grocery store. Fried calamari slightly better but nothing memorable. The waitress was fine but again for a restaurant whose one of the chef is Jean - George I'd expect much more attentions. At the end of the meal we were never asked if we wanted to get another drink or something since we brought our own delicious cake from Sant'ambroeus. The restaurant was absolutely empty and despite this one dish was forgotten and our 15th guest ate 10 minutes after us, we had to tell the maitre D though, nobody realized the missing dish until we asked for it. Food runners had no idea where dishes needed to be dropped and which guest was having what. They kept asking us : ""who ordered this? Who ordered that?"" I thought I was at union square market. Everything was just so impersonal. Food was just ok, nothing to come back for. I had the breaded veal Milanese and all the breading came off like it was never attached to meat. Kale side was salty and escarole of Milanese extremely liquid for such a dry dish. Went here 2 years ago and remembered it mobbed and delicious, tonight it was empty and now I understand why. It's unfortunate because the location is great and the decor has a lot of potential. Hopefully it'll improve but as of now it's not a spot I'd ever go back and the remaining of my party thought just the same.",1,0,0,Flavio F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

Last minute decision based on food reviews and the fact that food&wine rated their Mac & Cheese #1 in the USA (Bold Statement)We waited an additional 30 minutes to get a table, doesn't seem like this restaurant is to concerned with customer service. Whom ever takes the reservation does not do a good job simply because of the 10 other groups that had to wait an additional 3o minutes for a reserved table.The hostess was pleasant and straight up, she did let me know that we were going to have to wait during our first conversation which in my opinion is a good thing. The waiter service was terrible. No one came to the table until 15 minutes after we were seated. When they did come she asked about water selection but before we decided she poured tap water. We ended up ordering flat but when the water arrived they never took the tap water off the table. Also, side note. The bottle of flat water costs $10 for 48oz so stick with tap if your on a budget. They don't mention price when asking. The server came back after another 15 minutes, asked us if we were ready to order. We ordered the following. She did not take a drink order so after the apps were served I had tservndMa s the server to get 2 sodas. It sucks having bad service.

White bean dip was good but, it was just a simple white bean dip. The Artichoke   was a waste of money, we had barely any meat and the serve never explained how we should eat it (I thought that neccisary because it came with a dipping sauce. Disappointed.The pork chop was very good, I would recommend that dish. The rib eye was thin, thinking it was going to be a thicker steak ($45) i ordered it medium. It ended up being thin so it was on the chewy side. They also did not bring me a steak knife and our server did not stop by the table after she brought us our drinks. I had to look for her to get the check. In a restaurant like this, with the higher prices and the focus on food you would think service would be a top priority. I would not go back.

A couple minutes later a waiter approached our table and without introducing himself or even formally greeting us, he gave us the menus and water.

They sat us at a table under the open stairs...and a gum wrapper fell down. This is a health violation as it is - with the literal s**t coming off people shoes as they walk down. Our waiter was super rude right off the bat. He was so condescending; it was as if he was imagining himself as Jean-George serving some lowly people HAHHAHA but he did reseat us. They ran out of the wine we ordered, some lady that looks like shes from the painting American Gothic (facial expression to match) was sprinting back and forth and bringing the wrong bottles. Cheap wine for the price tags, btw! Then, when were ready to order, some Cruella De Vil lady came out and started drumming her fingers on our table. She told us she needs the table in 45 minutes and for us to basically beat it! hahah UNbelieeeevable! I didn't know whether to give her my order or give her a dollar for her homeless cup.

The last one was a busboy - the only human there! However, he did end up sweeping crumbs on us (?) which was almost comical. They ruined the night for my moms bday. The manager brought out some pastry...(with no coffee/tea) to ""compensate"" ....then must have realized its really awkward and gave us all pastries...but later. We ended up ordering coffee and getting the check. Then they charged us twice for every single entree and for two (instead of one) bottles of wine...?!?!?! Had to print the check three times. This is completely insane for a restaurant like Mercer Kitchen to hire snobby, rude, and completely incompetent staff. I blame the manager because he is responsible for sorting things out and if need be, letting staff go. It's completely unacceptable! This isn't McDonalds. The manager himself just looked like he just wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. It's hard to find a place where the personability and charm of everyone there is zero, but we sure did!

Our group of 4 was seated at a long, communal table (there are private tables as well). I am not a huge fan of communal seating -  I always feel as if my conversations are not private. The service was pretty bad, actually. Our waiter seemed in a haste to get away from the table, he didn't even listen to the end of our sentences (I would have given 4 stars otherwise), and we had trouble asking follow-up questions and flagging him down (he forgot to bring us water that we requested twice). I felt like I couldn't get any answers about wine or food recommendations, so were on our own.  The food itself was rather good. We got a salad as an app to share, but I would skip it next time, it was mediocre. The Mozzarella pizza made for a nice appetizer. I enjoyed my burger, it was the highlight of my meal.  The grilled fish also looked good. Seems like every dish was pretty solid.

The wait for a table was bad enough but understandable for a Saturday lunch. However the delay was because the hostess was prepping a larger table for 5 rather than squeeze us at a table 4. Where did we sit?  A tight table of 4. The highlight was the prompt and frequent delivery of water. Thanks bus boys.  Our waiter finally came to take our order but never offered cocktails. That was the last we saw of him. We did manage to order a glass of wine which was delivered 15 minutes later.  Then the real wait ensued.  After another 45 minutes I tackled a manager and asked for status. Her gruff response did not offer much help.  Thankfully the busboys brought our meals.  Roasted lamb sandwich was ice cold, chewy and salty. The hamburger was cold and the roll was soggy from sitting in its juices.  The kale salad came sans Parmesan cheese.  We called the manager over to discuss the foregoing, and her response ""what would you like me to do about?  Take your food away?""  She made no offer to apologize or to mitigate the situation. And she actually said ""there is no way your food is cold.""  Fortunately at the end of the unfinished meal the other manager (a gentleman) brought us the check - with no apology and nothing comp'd. After a brief ""conversation"" with him, he did discount the bill.  The first time in 40 years of NYC dining that I left without tipping.  Sorry bus boys :(.   J-G better stop in and figure things out!!!   We will never go back.",0,0,0,Michael A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

I've taken my first post-college girlfriend to you on our first date, and my most recent girlfriend on our last date. I've seen both flings and cat fishes in your subterranean chic interior. You've always been the perfect choice for all kinds of dates, friend outings and business dinners. When I'm asked for a recommendation, you Mercer are the first that comes to mind, however when I'm asked to list my favorite restaurant, I don't think of you. Perhaps because you are so good to me, always available, even without a reservation. When I'm fiending for some late night satisfaction, I can always depend on you, but I just use you and discard you, never giving you the proper appreciation and status you deserve. I must admit, I am guilty of liking it and not putting a ring on it! Yes there are plenty of other restaurants in the sea. I have experienced far greater culinary thrills at far more glamorous restaurants. Restaurants that I have to wait weeks or sometimes months to visit, because they are never available for me when I want. Restaurants that have given me a thrill in the moment yet left me broke and defeated in the end, knowing that I cannot possibly continue the relationship! I've had cheap and easy restaurants, that I had gluttonously enjoyed, with fattening comfort foods of inferior quality that have left me feeling ashamed and downright disgusted with myself. You Mercer, have been the one constant in my life of restaurant debauchery and adventurous foodie experiences. I always come right back to you, with your trendy yet comfortable interior. Your  fantastic drinks and dishes of high quality and perfect portions that leave me perfectly satisfied. Your exceptional service with a smile that starts with the hostesses and continues with the servers. Your model-esque looking patrons that make me feel as if I'm one of them after I've had a drink or 10! The constant availability of parking within a one block radius.

4,9/4/2015,"Swanky, dark, and very cosmopolitan. This is the kind of restaurant you bring your girls night out to...or gay night out to. Either way, I can imagine an all male party being really uncomfortable here. The best options here were their pizzas. Soft and fresh out of their open kitchen, their truffle pizza is a must, and their broccoli rabe w/ salami was terrific. Our favorite entree was hands down the chicken and mashed potatoes which were moist and buttery, respectively. It may just be because rotisserie chicken is my favorite Pathmark thing ever, or because its legitimately good chicken. Who knows. But get it! The burger was delicious and the shoe string fries--highly addictive. The poppy seed crusted salmon I felt missed the mark, but the sautéed squash made some delicious sides. I like them over the Mac & cheese which I felt wasn't anything special. Their crispy rice salmon and tuna spring rolls seemed promising but alas, I've had better else where (Koi...yummm). I'd pass next time on those, but the pea guacamole was certainly an interesting spin on what is already a delicious dish. Top off your night with their fun alcoholic concoctions--the peach daiquiri, and cucumber mint martinis were the table's favorites!",1,1,1,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",787,445,182

None of us wanted to drink that night, so a buzz couldn't pass the time. Instead we noticed other groups being seated before us, with the hostess avoiding eye contact every time she passed.I'm not sure why the staff at Mercer Kitchen didn't want our money. I can't help but feel as if we didn't ""look"" the part, if you know what I mean.Anyway, this place is a joke and a testament to the laughable disaster that NYC has become. $17 smoothies?

I arrived with my three friends and checked it at 9:06 P.M., time passes by and the two restaurant ladies are busy walking around sitting other people who arrived after us and we had a reservation. Not even acknowledging us or giving us a wait time. Now, it's 9:30 P.M. and I walk back to the check-in area and the lady says a table is about to open up and that they are paying. Oh, great you would think!  They go ahead and sit other people else right in front of our faces. So 9:45 P.M. comes around and I walk back to the sign-in area and this gentleman is standing and gives me the run-around that he can't kick people out and people have been there for three hours. He offers a drink complimentary, but I declined. I understand it is a Saturday night but professionalism and punctuality has to be maintained.

And strange was my entire experience.Waited a little too long at the bar for a drink. I was joined by my party - we were seated promptly. The waiter seemed busy - maybe he was serving too many tables? He didn't speak up - so we never learned the specials.I ordered the tuna sashimi salmon - tasted like it had been sitting out too long.My wife ordered the salmon entrée... bland.My beloved Mercer burger - was good... THIS BURGER I NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD - IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AMAZING!!!!!!!! As it has been for so long. The reason I love this restaurant.My French fries were also, a bit cold, hard... Not per usual.The icing on the CAKE - I went to the restroom and as I was washing my hands I noticed - NO, IT CANNOT BE - the thick disposable towels that I have used so many times were gone - replaced by thin unimpressive paper towel.NOT GOOD.I'm a sucker for detail, and this one change got me thinking... MERCER peaked... and now, they are cutting their loses -got rid of their general manager, and are coasting this ship into the night.I'm upset. I hope not...

The wait took about 10 minutes. The decor is modern with industrial accents. A great place for catching up, instagram photos, and food.The Mercer Burger came with fries. Each fry is fried to perfection, if that's even possible. Either I was extremely hungry or the burger looked really good, I took the first bite without examining the burger itself. As I was chomping down this baby, my friend told me there were avocados in the burger. I was mind blown lol. (P.S. avocados in a burger is my new favorite thing). Back to the burger, the meat was cooked to my expectations, the patty was heavenly, and the onions were the bam! to this masterpiece. This place is definitely worth the money and visit.

The general manager came and apologized and offered to comp us a round of drinks which we respectfully declined. For their prefix menu I had a mixed salad and a chicken entree. I was expecting overcooked food since they were a little behind but everything was perfect. Nothing was dry or bland or too intensive.Finally for dessert we had their angel food cake which was the closing act. Nothing overpowering at all.

4,6/25/2015,"I discovered the Mercer Kitchen after a long day of shopping in Soho, a labor intensive activity which of course left me totally starving. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the atmosphere. The space is roomy and open, yet tucked away underground which eliminates any chaotic energy from the city. The kitchen itself is such an essential part of the dining experience, which I absolutely love as it always provides such an aspect of freshness when the food preparation is visible. I have been to the Mercer Kitchen twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The chicken and coconut milk soup is phenomenal, and definitely a great choice is you're craving something warm and comforting during the wintertime. Pictured below is the warm salad of squash with Prosicutto and Pecorino cheese, which was a lovely balance of warm, sweet flavors offset by the cool and savory notes from the cured meat and cheese.Also pictured is the caramelized banana cake with praline crunch and salted caramel ice cream which was actually quite a simple yet AMAZING dessert. We tried the shaved fennel salad with arugula, parmesan and mushroom, which was nothing special and was a tad bit heavy on the parmesan cheese but tasty nonetheless. All in all, the Mercer Kitchen is a great spot to escape the Soho shopping madness and enjoy a fresh, quality meal.

I think cod or another flaky fish (like halibut) would have made for a better dish.  Also, the fries while tasty, were the least memorable.  I would definitely return.

The only issue on the main dining room floor was that the A/C was turned up a few notches too high for me (it wasn't particularly hot that morning).The breakfast/brunch offerings were fairly conservative, and relatively pricey (dishes don't come with a whole lot), but this synced up nicely with my recent forays into portion control. The eggs were very fresh and tasty, and the coffee was good. Tab was high as expected, but it's not a bad go-to option in a neighborhood where the lame local diner doesn't even open before 8.",3,0,1,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2506,1716,229

2,5/27/2015,"Mercer Kitchen, now how do I rate thee..Let's start off with the fact that the food was pretty solid across the board.  My companions and I celebrated Memorial Day with everything from the charcuterie to the rib eye to the pea soup.  The salmon sashimi was fresh (though rice not crispy.. Katsuya does it so much better).  However, Mercer Kitchen's shining star is the steamed shrimp salad.  I don't know what kind of crack champagne they pour into that vinaigrette, but for once I would ask for my salad to be drowned in dressing.  Their sautéed kale comes in a distant second.. I'm not a huge kale connoisseur, but it was cooked perfectly.My gripe comes down to the service.  I don't think the waiter ever came up to us and welcomed us, introduced himself, or asked if we had any questions.  I suppose the pro to that is I can't put him on blast in a public forum such as this.  Now, I wouldn't mind if this was it.. but this non-service nonsense kept going.  It was difficult to catch anyone's eye, even a busboy, even though there were definitely plenty of blue shirts milling about.  Refill on water?  Order more dishes?  Get a check?  Now that I think about it, I don't think our waiter ever once came to us on his own accord, even to take our order, and he definitely did not ask how our meal was tasting.  Was it because we chose the fine tap waters of NYC that caused us to be snubbed in such a manner?  Maybe we ordered ""so much"" food that we didn't deserve the complimentary basket of bread.  Not so much as an apology for getting a side sub wrong.Regardless of the terrible service, I would come back for that damn salad.  Jean Georges knows how to steam a mean shrimp, and cook everything else pretty well too.",0,2,0,Lil L.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,110,74

It took me back to a time I felt safe and loved. Like as a baby when I was gently sucking on the teet of my mother whilst she provide me with her warm, precious milk. I also had a side of well done bacon. It was perfect. When I woke up that Sunday I wasn't in a great mood. I had just woken up and turned on the television only to flip to that sad animal commercial with Sarah McLachlan's ""Angel"" playing in the background and I was all like ""well now I have to kill myself"".

The menu's breadth makes it a good place for pleasing a large range of tastes and dietary preferences. The ambiance felt nice but still casual. The layout of the restaurant was great for groups and I can imagine taking my younger brothers out here for a nice dinner when they're both in the city. They're also teenage boys without the refined palates of some fellow yelpers. Important to note that it can get pretty loud in here. The menu covers a lot of ground. I had sashimi, ravioli, lamb chops, mashed potatoes, meat and cheese platter, and Madeleines for dessert. Okay-- as you can imagine each particular dish wasn't as amazing as it would be if the restaurant specialized in one type of cuisine, but they were all generally safe bets. The ravioli was really bland though. The lamb chops, which I had rare, were amazing and really juicy. Very recommended. My friends ordered a couple fish dishes and they seemed really good and substantial in size. I would recommend if in mood for something healthy. Note that the kitchen is very light w the salt, which is nice for people watching their blood pressure, but I had to add some more for myself. Service was standard and nice.

Josh also came over and sincerely apologized for the experience. He offered us a discount on the bill and provided us with his contact information for next time.

2,3/23/2015,"IN SHORT: Dark, stylish dining with enough errors in service and execution to make you wonder whether the Jean-Georges brand has been spread a little too liberally and a little too thin.THE STORY: Because of its location on a particularly upscale stretch of Prince Street inside the Mercer Hotel, Mercer Kitchen can fill quickly on a Friday or Saturday night, full of glamorous clientele crowding the downstairs bar and squeezing into small tables before a night out. Yet for all of its bustle, the busy basement space is not churning out food worthy of much notice.Most of the main courses are wildly overpriced for the quality of the dish, and a better meal can be easily constructed with a few market sides, appetizers, and a pizza. Though even after you've built a full meal out of the left side of the menu, your waitress may still look at you flatly and ask, ""And for your entrees?"" as one did at a recent visit. A big disappointment was the Warm Whole Artichoke whose lack of salt and thick mustard mayonnaise dip just destroyed the subtle flavor of the artichoke meat. We were so disillusioned after spending $15 on something we could have cooked at home far better for less than $4 that we didn't even bother making our way to the heart. Fortunately, the Kabocha Squash and Ricotta Toast was a soft and pleasant version of bruschetta, balancing the sweetness of the squash with spice and a thin, savory layer of ricotta. The Sashimi Salmon, Raw Bar offerings, and Carpaccio of Black Sea Bass with lime, coriander, and mint are also light and fresh dishes that grace many tables.Continuing its success with raw food, the Raw Tuna and Wasabi pizza is a clever addition to a menu that appeals to its local, pretty masses, though the Black Truffle and Fontina Cheese pizza is likely the best on the menu. Its thin crust gets soft and soggy quickly, but a few bites of the rich mushroom flavor will make the texture easy to ignore.Less easy to ignore are the flagrant errors in service from a staff that seems geared to turn over tables as quickly as possible. All of our appetizers, sides, and entrees arrived on the table far too quickly and all at once, forcing our server to crowd our two-top uncomfortably. The issue here, of course, is that by the time we made it to our main course, much of it had cooled. At one point, a staff member also swooped in and swiftly grabbed a plate with a bit of food left on it without saying a word like some sort of dish-seeking ninja, even though we were far from finished. With little reward to the overall meal, it makes one question if a dinner here was ever worth it. But if the bar scene and the dark, flattering space are what you're after, you'll be just fine.",5,0,1,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

The restaurant itself is huge, with a very chic and swanky SoHo vibe. We first ordered drinks from our waitress (a cute girl with short blonde hair), and they took almost 20 minutes to arrive. That was a red flag! After another 20 minutes, she returned to take our orders. I ordered the Beets & Goat Cheese appetizer, (which was tasty), followed by the Organic Salmon, which arrived about 50 minutes after the beets and was pretty cold and flavorless.

2,3/6/2015,"Echoing some other reviews here, but came here for Restaurant Week and genuinely left disappointed. I tend to not like to complain, but it really was a mediocre experience at best.I've been to Mercer Kitchen outside of Restaurant Week before but had forgotten I had been there previously: guess I didn't find it to be too memorable. Anyhow, I thought the food was consistently just ""meh."" I normally love butternut soup, but theirs seemed really weak on the squash flavor. The fish (skate, I think) would have been sadly plain if not for an excessive amount of peppers. The vanilla (?) dessert was maybe the most unimpressive thing I've eaten this year, like how I would imagine a slice of cake from the refrigerator case of a supermarket without an in-house bakery would taste.Yet probably what annoyed me enough to write this review was the fact that while eating, I thought I noticed water dripping on me. I ignored it at first, thinking maybe I was imagining things (and again, I tend to not like to complain), but eventually I think my waitress noticed I was looking upwards, came by, and got splashed herself. She called over a manager/co-worker whose swift solution was to hang an umbrella upside down from the rafters, which I guess solved the problem.After thinking about it, I think the culprit was a leaky exposed pipe overhead... but the fact they were immediately prepared to fix this makes me think this problem happens frequently? But if so, why would I be seated there, especially given the restaurant wasn't busy at that time? Also, I really hope it was just a water line leaking and not a sewer pipe. Now, yes I would be surprised if it were sewer, but still... this really wasn't the best subject to be pondering on during a supposedly nice dinner.As for the positives, the service was swift and efficient enough.

The grapefruit whiskey sour was pretty good - loved the fresh grapefruit garnish. Now the service here is complete shit. They took their sweet ass time with each course. Our server couldn't remember one request- leave the dressing on the side. When we asked her that the dressing wasn't on the side... She asked if we want more... Like what? Are you stupid or just stupid. Then when we asked for our checks with the dessert... Of course they forget our check and it took them forever to return our cards.I had a decent experience but once is enough for me.",1,1,0,Christine B.,"Queens, NY",81,184,331

4,3/5/2015,"Janica was an amazing waitress.I normally never write reviews, but I was really impressed with the service and quality of the food at this fine establishment. Made reservations for 2 for restaurant week. As we walked in we were greeted well and treated properly. They have coat check for cold winters and our chairs and table were pulled out for us. (Excellent) As we sat down the waitress, Janica, introduced herself and set aside the menus for us. Gave us sometime to think. As the food came out we were asked couple of times if we were ok and if we need anything. I guessing they do routine check-ins on their customers. (Excellent) Food was exceptional. We ordered the Pizza and squash soup for apps. Entrees were the Chicken and Skate.Dessert was lava cake and lemon crepe cake.App-Pizza was amazing. Very flavorful and a very generous portion for restaurant week. Squash soup was delicious, BUT I found a piece of rock or some sort in the soup. Did not return it cause I'm a guy..So I took it out and continued to drink.Entree-Chicken was well grilled and well dressed with salad on top. Towards the end on the salad portion. My girlfriend found a strand of red hair. Grossed out she decided to return the dish and did not want another. The waitress came over apologized about the dish and took off the cost of one patron. Roasted Skate was well cooked. Soft and cooked perfectly on the inside well breaded on the outside.Dessert-Lava cake and lemon crepe cake. What more can you say. Taste them once tasted them all. Nothing special about dessert.3 stars for excellent customer service food and presentation.1 star for handling the check properly and for the waitress to being very apologetic.Cheers",0,0,0,Brian M.,"Edgewater, NJ",29,45,47
4,3/4/2015,"Came here for Restaurant Week and my dinner was fantastic. The restaurant is located downstairs and is trendy and posh in a classic way that won't soon go out of style. I'm happy to report that there is ample room to move about the tables without knocking into other diners, which seems to be a rarity amongst restaurants these days.We ordered the butternut squash soup with trumpet mushrooms, which was so creamy and delicious. The mushrooms add a depth of flavor to the soup, making it all the more amazing. We selected the pan roasted skate for our entrees, and this was just as excellent as the soup. The fish was perfectly cooked and I loved the mushrooms in this dish as well. For dessert, I had the chocolate cake and also tried the lemon crepe. Both were absolutely fantastic. The chocolate cake will satisfy any chocoholic's sweet tooth, and the lemon crepe was so light and sweet that you can't help but to savor every bite. Terrific meal!My only comment is that I wish the waitress could have been a bit more attentive. We wanted to order a second round of drinks, but she disappeared for quite a while after taking our food orders. We had to ask someone to find her for us, and when my friend had questions about the wine list, she offered some half-hearted lackluster wine advice, which was just as unhelpful as it was unenthusiastic. It seemed pretty clear she wasn't very knowledgable about the wines to be able to offer any valuable recommendations.Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience very much and I would definitely return to Mercer Kitchen.

2,3/4/2015,"Came here for restaurant week with 2 friends and was expecting an awesome experience - given Jean Georges' namesake.Instead, what we got was disappointment and regret. The interior of the restaurant is very nice, with a spacious and airy downstairs, giving it a sense of grandeur. However, their table setup was a bit disjointed, as they cramped 3 people into a 2-person table.For food, I got their:Butternut Squash Soup - my favorite thing on their menu. The soup was warm (extremely welcome given this hellacious Winter), creamy yet light. The mushrooms were a nice touch in enhancing the flavor profile and adding depth to the dish. Buttermilk Chicken Milanese - while it wasn't bad, it certainly didn't stand out in any aspect. I liked the lightly fried texture of the chicken, but the taste was too one dimensional. A more robust, flavorful sauce could have saved this dish.Sour Cream Babka- The most disappointing thing on the menu. Even the coffee ice cream (and I'm a total sucker for all things coffee) couldn't save the stale, tough-as-nails babka (basically a raisin bread). On top of the disappointing food, their service was pretty lackluster. We had two waitresses - one of whom was training the other - but instead of double the service (I understand it doesn't work like that, just making a point mkaay?), we got half as much. At least from a competence standpoint.Anyways, the TLDR: uninspiring, average food that normally would net this place 3-stars, but drops to 2 given the bad service and higher expectations associated with the owner.",5,0,1,Peter Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",656,636,415
2,3/4/2015,"What a disappointment. The space is great- very trendy, bustling, dimly lit and sexy. But the food was really under seasoned.

Upon entering this spot, I was amazed by the fashionable crowd it attracted and suddenly felt as if I were in a scene of Sex in the City.Once we reached downstairs, we were seated immediately due to the reservation my friend made which I highly recommend. I must say that this restaurant has great ambiance and super tasty drinks! My taste buds agree more with a refreshing, sweet, or slightly spicy alcoholic type of drink which their cocktail menu has many options of. For my first drink, I had the ginger margarita which was very good just wish it wasn't placed in a kid sized glass filled with ice and after about five sips I was about finished. My second drink of choice was the raspberry martini which was good but super sweet. The Roasted Hake in garlic sauce with crunchy potatoes and summer peas was my choice of entree for the night. It was just ok for me as I felt it was lacking a little bit more seasoning and could have been paired with a different side. For dessert, I had the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake cocoa bean brittle with vanilla ice cream; it was absolutely delicious! The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.

No problem - we got a drink and were busy hanging out and catching up. When we finally got seated around 9:45pm, the host was very gracious, and even brought us their signature crispy salmon appetizer as an apology.  We all shared entrees - got a burger with fries, a pork chop, and two MORE rounds of the crispy salmon because it was just so good. The burger was great. The Pork Chop came with some parmesan grits and braised cabbage.  It was good but my friend and I who split the Pork Chop realized while we were eating it that neither of us are really crazy about pork, the dish as a whole sounded great but we didn't love it. If you really like pork then it would probably be a hit. Overall the restaurant has a fun vibe - great for girls night out or a date spot. Could be great for groups too!

4,2/24/2015,"A friend and I came by for restaurant week 2015 lunch. I ordered the tuna tartare, hake with napa cabbage and seaweed butter, and chocolate cake with ice cream. My friend ordered the truffle pizza, hake and profiteroles. The tuna was good but missing something --- it seemed to need a touch of salt. I get why there wasn't any -- you could really taste the fish, but I wanted a little (no salt anywhere!). The truffle pizza was delicious -- warm, fluffy, rich (but not TOO rich). It was my  favorite & reminded me of the homemade pizza my mother used to make. The hake itself was cooked properly with a nice charred skin. I got a few bones (eep!) but that's to be expected with fish. The cabbage was delicious and buttery. The little croutons in the dish were tasty. The orange peel was unnecessary as a lime came with the dish. The chocolate cake was tasty but nothing to write home about. The ice cream was really sweet and lacked any real flavor. I would come back to try other menu items, but not during restaurant week -- was too crowded and the meal came out fairly slowly. It took about 1.5 hours from start to finish. Luckily, we had the time but it could be frustrating if you only have 45 mins for lunch. Decor was nice, the tables weren't TOO close together, staff wasavailable and friendly, but lighting was a little dim for daytime but ok on the eyes -- we were seated downstairs under a walkway (it was rather loud & distracting when the occasional person stomped across).

I love Jean Georges' ABC Kitchen and thought that Mercer Kitchen would provide a similar experience, but I was extremely underwhelmed by every aspect of the restaurant.My friends and I thought that restaurant week would be a fantastic time to try this restaurant since it is on the pricier end, but I don't think I would come back - not even for another restaurant week.I ordered:Appetizer - Pizza with Broccoli Leaf and ProvoloneEntree - (The Mercer) Burger, Pepper Jack Cheese, Avocado, Crunchy Red Onions, Russian Dressing, French FriesDessert - Sour Cream Babka , Coffee Ice Cream, Caramelized BananasThe pizza was probably the best thing I had all night, and then it went downhill from there. The burger was nothing to write home about - and in all honestly probably should NOT have been on the restaurant week menu. It was most likely the most filling of all the entrees, but it really is nothing special. I mostly ordered it because our group wanted to all order different items off of the menu.The dessert, which is usually my favorite part of the meal, was awful. The babka was so stale that I could barely cut it with my fork. I ended up just eating the little tiny (TINYYY) dollop of ice cream and the carmelized banana.Also, our waitress was terrible. It was obvious that she was just being trained - by how she completely screwed up how we wanted to split our check (thank god for Venmo). I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, but maybe starting during a NON Restaurant Week week would have been better for all parties involved. It was really quite painful to watch her training process, and for how much we paid for our meal, service really should have been top of the line.Sorry Mercer Kitchen, this is a definite NO GO.",4,2,1,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",893,1172,889

The food is great especially the tuna crispy rice, truffle pizza, the fish tangine and the burger. We were a group of three, and we all loved our meal. We snacked on their sinfully delicious white truffle pizza. I started with their chicken coconut milk & thai basil soup, served with a scoop of jasmine rice. OMG. So good. I had the crab fritters, which were perfectly cooked, and tagine of sea bass over a terrine of orange infused vegetables, which was yummy..the flavours are just orgasmic.

When arriving, the restaurant looked smaller but Lapin and I were seated downstairs which was a lot more open and opulent looking. The open space plan added a sense of luxury but also made the dinner feel intimate. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. The only thing that was a bit annoying is that how they gave only one piece of bread at a time. If you wanted more, you had to ask. For a classy restaurant, giving only one piece of bread at a time makes the whole experience feel a bit cheaper and pedestrian as you have to portion out your bread supply. Lapin ordered the Sashimi Salmon which he liked but thought they were a bit plain. They gave four small cucumber slices topped with Salmon; for $18 it was a bit pricey. We split an order of Oven Roasted Spinach pizza. I thought it was a bit too salty [but still good] but Lapin thought it was perfect. We had Three Cheese Ravioli, the sauce was rich and tasty but Lapin thought it was too salty. The ravioli wasn't anything extraordinary but had the same taste and texture as frozen ravioli you can purchase at the supermarket. Overall, the food was okay but overpriced. The only reason why I gave the restaurant 4 stars instead of 3 was because of the ambient environment and the super friendly wait staff.

One of my best grilfriends were in town and we decided to grab lunch there. Our server clearly did not want to be there. We got the Bass carpaccio which tasted okay. I dont know who plated it though because it looked like a dog threw up on the plate and somebody microwaved it after adding some cheese on top. My burger was good though.

4,1/21/2015,"I was *soo excited* to finally check out one of Jean Georges' restaurants. And maybe because of that, my expectations were set too high. My first impressions of the place was that it's actually a lot more spacious and wide open inside (on the bottom level) than it looks when you first walk in. We ordered a couple appetizers including the crispy squid and the black truffle pizza. Both of these menu items were good, but I wasn't blown away as I thought I would be. For my entree, I had the slow baked organic salmon, cooked exactly how I asked: rare. The salmon was served with potatoes and the babiest brussels sprouts I have ever seen. I mean literally, I did not know brussels sprouts could be so baby. I also had a side of mac and cheese, which came out piping hot and super cheesy! My dinner was cooked well and I for sure scraped the plate clean, but I've had equally delicious meals elsewhere too. Maybe the hype of Jean Georges jumbled my brain, but if I was given the opportunity to dine at one of his other restaurants, I would. I heard really great things about one of his other establishments, ABC Kitchen, where the menu is similarly priced but the food is really top notch.One thing I will say about the Mercer Kitchen is the service is really excellent, which is the reason I'm giving a 4-star review versus a 3-star.

4,1/4/2015,"Went to Mercer Kitchen last night.  I do have do openly admit that I have become a fan of Jean George establishments.  This one is a bit different.  While the decor is nice, it is certainly not one of his fancier establishments which is why I think I liked it.  There was a good vibe and energy to the space without the sometimes persistent snobbishness that you can sometimes find at some is his higher end places.The service was adequate.  It was nothing over the top and nothing to write home about.  In fact one surprise of the night was being seated at a completely soaking wet booth (it was a rainy NYC night).  When we informed the staff they did little to take care of the situation so we moved our table ourselves.  Surprising given the level of service I have become accustomed to at his other properties.  Now onto the food.  This is one of Jean George's more reasonably priced menus and I thought the food quality was just as good.  The rigatoni and meatballs were excellent, as well as the burger and fries (people rave about these fries in there reviews, my friends and I would have to agree), the rack o lamb was also tasty.  I personally had the steamed skate and asparagus which I thought was extremely good.  So overall solid 3.5/4 stars for food.I will also add that we had a junior diner with us (2 years old).  They had a great children's menu and treated him quite well to accommodate his eating schedule which I was impressed with, as often this doesn't happen or is treated as more of a chore than service.The one let down of the night seemed to be the appetizers.  I did not personally have one, but the friends I were with were not overly thrilled with them (little neck clams, salmon sashimi, and butternut squash soup).I will be back though so if that tells you anything I enjoyed it!",0,0,0,James S.,"Williston Park, NY",0,24,0

It had enough spice and flavor and was not overloaded with tomato juice. We started off with a pastry basket consisting of some muffins (bran and cranberry) a cheese pastry (which was quite good) pain e chocolate and a croissant (which was far too sweet for me). We also shared some Kumomoto oysters which were very good as well as the mignonette sauce which accompanied them. I went with my brunch standby, Eggs Benedict. They were good but not great as there was only a smattering of hollandaise and the plating was quite sloppy with the eggs siding off the muffins. It came with a few small pieces of rosemary home fries and a lightly dressed salad of mixed greens. Service, despite being there early, was quite slow and somewhat inattentive.

3,1/1/2015,"This place looks and feels like a fancy restaurant, but it's not a restaurant I would recommend especially considering there are so many others just down the street. The appetizers were pretty great, but the entrees I ordered were just minimal. The crab fritters were pretty good! It comes with a side of aioli which cuts the fishiness of the crab filling.The sea bass was my favorite even though it looks more like two pieces of ham plopped on the plate with olive oil. But it's fish alright! It had the right amount of acidity and the warm bread that came with the dish was perfect to dip into the remaining olive oil from the plate.The rigatoni with meatballs was alright. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente with juicy meatballs, but I wish the sauce had more flavor... It was a bit bland for me. The burger looked okay. Not worth $19 though. On a positive note, the fries were good! I love me some crispy crispy thin fries The service not that great. Our server was not very nice. You can tell he was not having a good day. But it didn't bother us too too much. It took a while to get his attention to order our food. And it took a while for us to flag him down for another drink. But he was prompt on giving us our check... To be fair, the place was crowded so it's understandable. I don't think I will be coming back...",2,2,1,Judy K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",428,213,764

1,12/27/2014,"I will start by saying I showed up at 4:45pm so the main dining room was closed and probably added to my horrible experience. That being said if you cannot provide good service and good food during the ""late lunch"" hours then you simply should close the kitchen because that was a terrible representation of a restaurant. The upstairs hostess was useless and sent us to the downstairs bar and telling us it would be 5 minutes. After a few minutes we returned upstairs and it was clear she had forgotten about us. She sat us in a table by the upstairs bar with no drink menus and no food menus. My boyfriend had to reach over to the bar and grab some food menus. Then I asked the busser for a drink menu. When the good finally came out. Two burgers and a sandwich... My burger and my fries were not even hot as if they had been sitting cooling in the kitchen for a ridiculous amount of time. For a $21 burger I expect house made fries and nice warm juicy burger. I got none of that. To end my rant, the server never even came over the check on us after the food arrived and the busser brought us the check.

No wow factor.For my entree i ordered the: ROASTED LAMB SANDWICHwith Roasted Red Pepper, Arugula and Herbed MayonnaiseIt doesn't say on the menu, but it's supposed to come with homemade chips. However, they ran out of chips and gave me fries. The waitress didn't indicate it came with a side so I ordered a side of fries. The lamb was sliced, and it was quite gamey but yummy.

2,12/1/2014,"So I'll rate this on food and service.Food: I thought the food was pretty good. I don't think it's as mind blowing as people have mentioned in other reviews, but it's better then average. I didn't exactly get what I wanted/ordered but I'll mention that when I talk about the service.Service: Pretty bad. I came with a big group, so it's understandable to have a mixup or two but I don't think anything worked out well for me. I ordered a bunch of appetizers and never got them. I ordered a second drink after I finished my first...never got it. When I asked about the appetizers I found out they actually gave my appetizers to another table. At this point I was pretty hungry so I asked them to forget about getting me new appetizers and just get our other orders out. At this point my tables getting a little ""hangry"" (anger as a result of hunger) and we have to wait another 15-20 mins after the appetizer mixup before we get our actual meals.Lots of reviews mention that they don't get your burger temperature right, and that is 100% correct. My friend ordered his medium well, and my wife and another friend ordered there's well done. All three burgers came out medium/medium rare. I personally don't condone eating any type of high quality beef higher then medium, but I think if a person asks for a certain temperature, and the burger/steak costs over $15-$20...give them the right temperature! The lackluster food and poor service really killed my mood for the rest of the night. Not a good experience.Overall, a very average restaurant. Not a fan. Wouldn't really recommend it to people.

Entrance is so subtle that it can be easily missed, Hence you can tell that the place is not entirely aimed to attract the tourist crowd in SOHO. So we ended up here just coz we did not get reservations at the other Jean Georges restaurant i haven been wanting to go, called ABC kitchen, so I thought y not mercer. Although yelp reviews were not entirely in the favor but I like to make my own judgments. Anyhow, we ended up here on a busy sat night. Seated on the lower level, very nice corner booth. Couldn't have asked for a better seating. I crave cocktails my entire week and when  i go out on weekends i make sure i get good one. And man i must say, mercer kitchen did not disappoint me. I know my choice was very classic, raspberry lychee bellini and raspberry basil gimlet, but you do need an art to master the classics. All the cocktail loving girls out there, you have to try them. For appetizers i ordered the artichoke. Umm frankly i have never had a full baked artichoke flower before so can't compare but i found it a little bitter and chewy. Least to say, my money would have been better spent on the beet salad judging from the other tables(i know i shouldn't be eying other tables). Anyway for the entree i had truffle fontina pizza, and OMG IF YOU ARE A VEGETARIAN, YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!! it's beyond anything you have ever had. So good. My husband had pork chop, and to say the least, his plate was totally clean. For dessert we had strawberry shortbread. I would say you would love it only if you love strawberries coz it had a very strong flavor. In all, i wouldn't shy to go back, even if it is just for the drinks.

You're served bread to start, everybody loves a snack. For my entree, I ordered the Steamed Skate (with Tarragon, Sesame Seed, Asparagus and Sushi Rice). This was a really great dish. The fish is super delicate and generously portioned. It's almost bathing in a savory broth, in the best way possible. The asparagus was perfectly cooked, not too crisp, not too tender, Goldilocks style. And the sushi rice was a perfect compliment, substantial and sticky, and really great when soaking up the flavors of the broth and fish.",4,0,0,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",160,257,919

Ordered a sweet pea soup, fresh beet juices and burrata to start.  Their bread was very good but I found it weird they would only serve us one piece at a time-the bread basket came from under their waiter/waitress stand.  Not sure that's up to code.Their chairs are way too high for the tables and as I got up I bumped the table and spilled the fresh juice- they cleared everything as I was in the bathroom but my friend said they made an even bigger mess while doing so.  My bottled water in a glass was gone so we asked for it, they offered to give us a new one but never did. They may have given me a new juice? They gave me a better chair as well. We then shared a black truffle pizza and kale salad.  The pizza was quite thin, tasty but a bit too salty. Kale salad was average.  The place is gorgeous but their bathrooms have no AC it's like a sauna in there. I'd hate to think of all the bacteria floating around.

We had heard good things, obviously this restaurant has a decent reputation. We made a reservation, obviously. But when we arrived on time, they told us we could wait 20 minutes for the table or sit at the communal high table next to the kitchen..and elevators. How romantic. We were starving so we obliged. (What's the point of a reservation, again?)Being near the kitchen was hot. And we were under these ridiculous lantern/heat lamps they have as their lighting. Weird choice and did I mention HOT. Our calamari appetizer arrived before my cocktail (more on the cocktail later). The appetizer was ok...little chewy, poor presentation.I ordered Veal Milanese for dinner, my boyfriend the NY strip steak. His entree was fine - big piece of meat, decently prepared, met the price tag, etc. Mine, on the other hand, was terrible. I have never seen, read, heard of a Veal Milanese recipe that wasn't veal breaded and sautéed. This was FRIED VEAL. Out of the fryer!  Who does that? And doused in pepper. On top of (what was supposed to be) a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes. I couldn't even taste the meat due to the pepper - a ridiculous amount of seasoning. The arugula was wilted, also doused in vinaigrette and the tomatoes were regular..one heirloom and they were all chopped so huge that the presentation was off. Dice the tomatoes maybe? For the $34 price tag, my meal was a joke.The raspberry gimlet cocktail was the best part of my meal. That's terrible. The meal, well, I could have done better in my own kitchen.I don't usually write bad reviews but when you're expecting something top shelf and you wind up with this experience - I just had to share.

Bacon was incredibly dry as if they fried then baked it until all the flavor was gone. -Incredibly subpar service.

We made the reservation with the intent of doing restaurant week, however ended up mostly ordering off the menu. The food is great, however the service was AWFUL! First off, we waited 30 mins past our reservation to be seated, meanwhile the hosted keeps telling us it will be 5 minutes. Finally we are seated, and the ""waiter"" brings us a complimentary pizza. We thought perhaps this was a result of our long wait for our table. A ""sommelier"" or ""manager"" comes over to take our drink order. We decided to order cocktails first and then move onto wine. We ordered 4 different vodka drinks, the ""sommelier"" brought us 2 out of the 4 drinks. The other 2 drinks followed later by the ""waiter"" and one of them was 100% incorrect. My friend asked for a dirty martini on the rocks but he tried to give her a vodka on the rocks with a lime garnish. Anyways, he goes back to the bar to rectify, however she still doesn't get her drink for another 15-20 minutes after we almost halfway finished our cocktails. The sommelier/manager comes over and takes our food order, we order appetizers and entrees. Appetizers come out, but one is missing whoops!!! We are very thirsty at this time as we finished those cocktails and no one is the be seen to help us out! We finish eating our appetizers and then our waiter comes over and tries to take our order for our entrees! We were very annoyed and told him we already gave it to the sommelier/manager! He was EXTREMELY confused and said ""OH OK I will go see."" He was able to produce a bottle of wine for us, THANK GOD! Finally the entrees and the forgotten appetizer arrive about 20 minutes later. We finish both those and the wine but again no one is around to assist. Finally someone comes over, the waiter, to take our dessert order. However, they don't arrive for another 20 minutes. I'm sorry, but I have worked in the restaurant industry and IT DOES NOT TAKE 20 minutes for DESSERT!!! We finally finish and ask for the bill. The server comes back over and tells us that he took off that pizza which he told us was COMPED in the beginning. All in all horrible service, the worst!

I ordered the steamed skate because I wanted to try something new. It was extremely cold and tasted really bitter. Not impressed whatsoever. Now to the nightmare and the reason why I refuse to dine here ever again.The bill comes and my friends and I split it 3 ways. My portion came out to $35.00 (we left the tip in cash). I signed and it was processed as $35. When I checked my statement a few days later it cleared at $172.00. I called and spoke to a young lady (on a Saturday) who said she would send the matter to corporate who would handle it by Monday (gave her of my credit card info).

Finally I speak to a manager and was told that the refund would be issued on Wednesday (also gave him my credit card info). Wednesday came. No phone call, no refund. I call again on Thursday. The manager said he would call me back within the hour. I waited 4 hours, nothing. I call back AGAIN. After being sent to speak to approximately 3 people (all of whom asked for my credit card info) I spoke to a woman in accounting who had the wrong information about my card (you think they would've gotten it correct after as many times as I gave it out) and was arguing with me about the amount. (I was extremely clear with what the charges were and what the issue was) She finally figures out the issue and apologizes but instead of issuing a refund right away.

What is noteworthy about their dishes is that they know how to pair food. The prawn salad was visually stunning and delicious. What made it delicious was the light dressing that had a perfect balance of tang, slightly sweet, acidic taste that enhanced the flavor of the prawn.

We were seated promptly since we had a reservation, but they took FOREVER to take our orders, bring our food and bring our check. There was about a 30-40 minute delay between our entree and dessert, and neither the waitress nor the manager apologized or offered explanation. Yes, it was Friday night during RW, I understand things were hectic, but at least some gesture of apology would have been nice. The food was very disappointing as well. I got the Fennel Carpaccio for appetizer, and it was wayyyy too sour. I couldn't even finish 1/3 of it because of its overpowering vinegar taste. It was very tasteless and bland except for the sourness, so it was by far the worst dish I got for the night. The entree, Slowly Baked Organic Salmon, was okay but nothing out of this world. Again, the dish was somewhat tasteless and bland overall. The only redeeming part of the dinner was their famous Warm Chocolate Cake, except it was served 30-40 minutes after the whole group was done with the entree.

Had the chicken breast for dinner. It was tender and not dry. The balsamic vinegar was a nice accompaniment...not too sweet or sour. Lastly, the warm chocolate cake is everything a chocoholic would want....warm cake, flowing liquid chocolate oozing out of the center, which is perfect bite when you pair it with the vanilla ice cream.  Here's what didn't cut it for me:1) Server was inattentive to start. We sat and he asked us if wanted drinks. We weren't ready and then we never saw him again. I had to tell the bread guy that we were ready to order and didn't know who/where was our server. 2) Side of french fries never made it to the table. We informed the server and he promptly apologized and offered free coffee to make up for the error. Here's where I would have given back a 1/2 star.

I should probably watch what I eat for the entree. Anyways, the salmon itself wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything great. I wish there was something else other than the kale and I didn't exactly enjoy the red verjus. The Mercer burger (that my friend ordered) on the other hand looked good and the fries were tasty! (The size was smaller than I expected but I'd get this next time)...- Dessert: Peach Tarte Tatin (White Chocolate, White Pepper Ice Cream, Peach Sorbet)I've had the warm chocolate cake at other Jean Georges establishments so I decided to go with the only other option.

3,6/27/2014,"I went to Mercer Kitchen on June 26th for my birthday lunch. My friend went through a lot of trouble in hopes of making sure my lunch was extra special. We arrived 7 minutes late to our 3:15 lunch reservation. Upon arriving we were told that there were no tables available and that the lunch was over. The maître D pretty much forced us to sit and eat at the bar. Determined not to let this ruin my birthday, I reassured my friend that everything was ok. Our bartender/waiter who never introduced himself (let's call him Johnny Clearwater) was very friendly. ""Johnny Clearwater"" cleverly presented us with the cocktails menu off the bat which was just what my friend needed to calm his frustrations. I ordered the Raspberry-Lychee Bellini and my friend got the Vodka Thyme Lemonade both drinks were stellar (I tasted both!) and things looked as if they were about to take a turn for the better. ""Johnny Clearwater"" then presented us with the late lunch minute, which unfortunately was extremely limited (it was literally a two leaf booklet). Still determined not to let this ruin my birthday we rolled with the punches and ordered. We decided on sharing the Mozzarella, Tomato & Pizza and the restaurants' namesake (The Mercer) Burger served with French Fries. The wait for our food seemed pretty reasonable. The pizza was very tasty, but a bit small. The freshness of the basil really kicked up the flavor profile. The burger and fries unfortunately were not hot! The fries were literally cold and my friend pointed out that they could have used a sprinkle of salt. The burger was also cold (a bit warmer than fries) which was another blunder. Sneaking suspicion was that the burger and fries made it to the pass before the pizza and they sat there getting cold while pizza was still being prepared. It's quite unfortunate because the flavor profile was truly amazing and the coldness made it impossible to enjoy. My friend who completely hates avocado didn't even realized that it was one of the condiments on the burger when he ate it. I had to remind him of his distaste for avocados which was truly funny. Taking into account the reservation snafu and cold burger and fries my birthday lunch was mediocre. The saving grace of lunch was obviously those cocktails and the ambience of the restaurant which was quite nice. I would probably hesitate about coming back to Mercer Kitchen, maybe for dinner if we are hopefully presented with a four page menu booklet instead of two.",1,1,1,Piotr R.,"Manhattan, NY",117,23,0
2,6/23/2014,"I had such a positive experience for dinner but don't come here for brunch. When you come to a restaurant for brunch, you expect to be able to tailor your meal to your liking. For example, my boyfriend's mother wanted to get toast instead of the potatoes that came with her meal. The waitress said she couldn't do that for her and would have to charge her for an extra dish of toast. My boyfriend's cousin wanted lox on her eggs. Nope, no can do. The waitress made her get a huge side of lox. I wanted to try their fresh juice (which is about $15!) and they wouldn't let me. Later, i saw it was because it came in a prepackaged bottle.

Lacked serious flavor.Mac and Cheese: Delicious! Very very richBurger: Reccomended by the waiter as his favorite dish and I can see why. Small thoughCrispy Squid: Best appetizer of the night!

Really great when dipped into the mac and cheese :pLobster: Presentation was amazing, delicious as wellBanana Dessert: INCREDIBLE to say the least, chocolate cake also amazingggThe server though... appeared to be on some serious drugs - crack would be my assumption. He was twitching, sweating, pale, bugg eyed, and appeared to have an extremely locked jaw. I believe a few of the staff actually pulled him aside and asked him about it. At this point, I know I saw him say something about us giving him a hard time. Which I guess if I was a crack head, I would look for an alternative outlet of blame other than myself as well. I did not appreciate this though, as we had easily spent ridiculous amounts of money on bottles, appetizers, entrees, and desserts as well as had been nothing but kind.

I think our server's name was Mary... she was from Orlando. attentive, helpful, and friendly. just a note: you may see the word ""ramp"" on the menu. apparently it is a mix of garlic and green onions (or something). really good. the ramp mashed potatoes are saltier than your average taters, and greener, but more delicious.",0,1,0,Edward C.,"San Diego, CA",130,24,2

When we again said ""no our friend isn't here yet"", she said something along the lines of "" if you are not going to order, you have to sit at the bar"" my initial reaction was to freak out, but instead I kept it together, looked around at the empty tables, and said "" if you need my table, I will gladly give it up, but for now.. were still waiting.""It's a convenient  place transit wise, and for tourists in the area, but it wouldn't be on my top rated.",1,2,1,Busra A.,"Manhattan, NY",62,79,53
2,3/8/2014,"Ok in my three months since I've transplanted here I've had the DB burger,  dumont burger,  Peter Lugers, Friedman's, the breslin, and of course shake shacks burger.  The mercer burger was a big disappointment to say the least.  I didn't even finish it and that's saying a lot for me cuz I'm a fat effing pig.  I would rather eat at shake shack and save the money.  When I first ordered the burger the waiter didn't ask how well cooked I would like my patty.  Out of curiosity I asked and he said medium and then asked if that was ok.  I was really contemplating to keep my trap shut but then said I typically like it medium rare.   I was second guessing if I should have mentioned anything at all since I had a feeling they might f it up. Of course it came out super rare or you could even say barely seared.   Which honestly I wouldn't mind since most of the time I don't mind raw bloody meat but it was compounded by the  fact that it was tasteless , dry, and not quality beef.     The waitstaff never asked about our main entrees so I never mentioned it and didn't really care for them to fix it.   My friends also had the other restuarant week pre fixed menu and only the butternut squash soup and crab cake was ok.  Nothing impressive.   I've heard bad  things about quality during nyc restaurant week but wanted to give it a chance.  If you're not going to do it right then why even bother.

3,3/7/2014,"3.5 starsI came here for Restaurant Week dinner, and left satisfied but not wowed. The only standout dish was the appetizer, the crab cake with avocado and cucumber in a lime sauce. (The menu also said crystallized ginger, but I didn't taste any). The crisp breading on the crab revealed a soft interior that was all crab no breadcrumbs, and the citrusy sauce and avocado lightened up the cake. I had a chocolate coconut water martini with rum, coconut water, and chocolate chili bitters ($14), which was just okay and way overpriced. I got the Crunch Roasted Hake with glazed mushrooms, green chili, and mint (again, didn't taste any mint) for my main. The fish was flaky and cooked beautifully with a golden crust, but it was lacking in seasoning. Dessert was a peanut and salted caramel mousse cake with caramelized bananas. With the exception of the salted caramel sauce on the side, none of the flavors were especially pronounced in this.  Service was friendly and attentive and we never felt rushed. I liked the minimal decor and open kitchen. For a Jean Georges restaurant, I was expecting a little better.",0,0,0,Cat K.,"San Francisco, CA",34,87,47
4,3/7/2014,"It is embarrassing that I just finally ate here.  As you walk into the restaurant you have the option to go directly downstairs or hangout in the hotel lobby lounge.  Our waitress was warm and very attentive.  She allowed us to stretch out our prix fix so my client and I can talk rather than have the food shuttled out immediately.  The food was vibrant and very fresh.  It felt like the vegetables and fish were found just hours before I ate it.  The crab cake was definitely better than anything you could have in Maryland.  It was an appropriate size and fried perfectly.  The avocado and other garnish livened up the crab meat nicely.  I enjoyed the hake.  It is very similar to sea bass, but more meaty and dense.  The crispy top was similar to the crab cake.  I was thrilled to see it was not over salted and that the jalapenos were not hot at all, but still tasting like a jalapeno.  The mushrooms were subtle and mimicked the consistency of the fish.  The chocolate cake was the most exciting part of the meal.  It oozed chocolate.  The ice cream and chocolate crisp added some more depth to it.  The space was expansive and tastefully accented by soft dim light against the dark panels and furniture.  The designer did a nice job bringing a modern contrast to what can be seen as an old world NYC restaurant.  Mercer Kitchen is significantly better than ABC Cocina, but not nearly as exciting as Spice Market.",2,1,0,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",244,557,33

What bothered me was the wine mark up- it was like over 400% as opposed to the standard 100-200% in most places. We literally paid $46 for an $8 (retail) bottle of wine.

The entire decor is amazing, with a library-setting on the first floor that is incredibly classy and a large space downstairs for eating.For the appetizer I ordered a tuna tartare but immediately regretted it upon seeing the ginormous truffle pizza appetizer that my friends ordered. It was enough to be a meal in itself. However, the tuna was so light and refreshing and mildly spicy. It was paired with a creamy avocado paste and cucumbers/olives that really helped cleanse the palate.For entree, I ordered the baked chicken with carrots. The crust on the chicken was beyond amazing and the carrots were soaked in a sauce. Never before have I loved a vegetable this much.For dessert, I ordered a gingerbread cake. It was okay.

4,2/21/2014,Went here with two friends for restaurant week.  The ambiance had a pretty laid back modern feel to it.  When it comes down to the service the waiters and waitresses were fine no complaints there.   Now the food was just mouthwatering.   The crab cake appetizer and the buttermilk squash soup are items I would literally eat everyday if I were rich and didn't mind gaining weight.   Usually crab cakes are a little soggy or chewy but the crab cakes here were on point.   Now the main entrees that we had were chicken with Milanese sauce and  a fish filet.   Again I am a bit skeptical about ordering seafood from most restaurants but the chefs here clearly knew what they were doing.  It had the right amount of flavor and it wasn't like eating rubber.  The chicken as well was cooked up to standards.  If you are paying this much for food it better be good.   For desert we all shared a chocolate cake with ice cream.   It was fine nothing special here.   Another plus is that the bathrooms were well kept.   Also I found it pretty cool that the workforce here was pretty diverse.   This is the type of restaurant that should represent modern American cuisine in New York City.   Not to mention the location is pretty cool.  Who doesn't love the Soho area.  I would come back if I'm in the area again.,0,0,0,Kevin Y.,"FLUSHING, NY",221,41,0

3,2/17/2014,"This review is more of a three.four star review.Well, here's another cool and hip restaurant in the SoHo area. Entering the restaurant, you'll see an expansive space once passing through the two large dark red leather curtains. With tables on the main floor and then an even bigger seating area downstairs, it's definitely a spacious place to eat. But if you want to go somewhere for just two people to keep things super intimate and romantic, this is not the place (although the vibe can be romantic since it's dark lit). The tables are large rows and or sit four. So if happens that there aren't any smaller tables, you may be placed at a larger table next to other people. It may be best to make a reservation if you have a party coming in and or it's just four people. The decor was cool and ""hip."" But as far as the food goes, I would say it was ""good."" What I had didn't blow me out of the water or anything. I started off with the Shaved Fennel Salad with Arugula, Parmesan, and Mushroom. The portion was definitely a large portion. If I had finished it, I definitely would've been full. But with Fennel everywhere, I could barely taste the Parmesan and Mushroom. There really weren't any strong distinct tastes for me to have. Next I had the Slow Baked Organic Salmon which came with broccoli, mashed potatoes, and ginger-herb vinaigrette. The salmon tasted fine, but with whatever spices, etc. they put on it - it tasted a little salty. I love broccoli and it tasted a little boiled for too long as it was almost soggy. Lastly, the mashed potatoes were also a little spicy. Everything ended with the Warm Pear & Sour Cherry Crisp dessert with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Once again, I wasn't blown away. The pears were nice and warm but I couldn't taste any of the ""sour"" from the Cherry at all. The scoop of ice cream was indeed very tiny.Overall, it was a nice experience. The service was quick during a busy lunch hour (during President's Day). I wouldn't mind trying out other dishes or going again to maybe go to the bar since the ambiance was nice. But for me the food wasn't worth the price.

I went yesterday with my best friend for dinner and the first thing I noticed was the many many many waiters and servers they had. First off, service was horrible. I felt like they were just room fillers to make it seem packed and busy.  With all the servers, we waited so long for the menu and so long to get a bill..For the appetizer, we had the steamed shrimp salad with avocado. Overall, it was satisfying but a little too much butter. It was too sour and oily.I had the roasted chicken with green beans and mashed potatoes. It was nicely cooked and perfect amount of green beans and mashed potatoes. It was like a classier version of Boston market. Most importantly,  it wasn't a small plate of it because a lot of the entrees were a tad bit pricey and not worth for the size.Mind you guys, my friend and I are from Queens and we're korean-american so our taste buds are different. So, my friend got the black truffle pizza. It was 4 small slices of just garlic poured all over it. It just tasted like way too much garlic and dust. We had to take some of my chicken in order to finish the pizza.The best part was the dessert. It was the chocolate cake with hot melted chocolate inside and vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! So sweet but not too sweet and the perfect amount. By the way, you're gonna have to speak up if you want to get a message across.

Went late (after 11.30pm) so the restaurant at the base closed.. but they allowed to order food at the upper level (lounge) which is pretty trendy and casual too.The crowd in this place is just from a different world so I was really looking for a great ceremonious meal..I ordered a vegetarian meal.. lentil soup, kale salad (suggested by the server) and 3 cheese ravioli (suggested over pizza by the server)while the dishes were simple I was really looking forward to a top of the line food experience..thats what fine dining is all about.. they jazz it up.. make it special.. but no..The lentil soup.. was just that.. plain ol lentil soup in a bowl.. no jazz.. no spunk.. no presentation.. (I get better soup during the lunch at Cosi)Three cheese Ravioli.. nothing fancy.. again no presentation.. nothing better than you would get at an Olive Garden.. and now the wait for the worst part..KALE Salad.. this was recommended by the server in a way that he has this daily!.. how could I contest with that confidence.. so I go with it.. what do I get.. a white plate full of Kale confetti with a few dried crouton.. dressing and parmesan cheese on the side.. the dressing is suppose to have Lemom.. but it tasted just like whipped up olive oil.. no salt.. no lemons no nothing!.. and the parmesan had just way too much responsibility of flavoring the salad..I mean is the chef for real? who passes Kale confetti as salad.. there was no other dimension or texture to the salad.. am I a Cow?

Our server was so good looking and was a pretty great addition to our meal.Highlights - Sparkly spiced apple cider: a perfect fall cocktail and it's pretty strong. Definitely recommend it.Crab fritter appetizer: the insides spill out a moist, gooey crab filling that's really flavorful and perfectly crispy on the outside. Salmon over crispy sushi rice: everything I love about salmon sushi but better. It comes in 5 small sushi pieces over crispy rice that made it crispy with every smooth salmon bite. I'm a big fan of crispy food (chips, fries,  etc.) and this just became my new favorite! We also got the rigatoni with meatballs. SO GOOD. The pasta is really flavorful and the meatballs were a great addition of flavor and weren't dry.",4,0,2,Sophie P.,"Boston, MA",1036,408,1746

Drinks took a long time to be brought to us. They had run out of certain food items, such as vegetables and it took some time to convince the waitress that if they run out of vegetables that come with an entrée, that perhaps they should be accommodating and allow for another type of vegetable. I have food allergies and even substituting the mashed potatoes were initially an issue. The food took over 40 minutes and once again, we had to ask another server to check up on it. It wasn't until near the end of our meal that our actual server started paying attention to us.

2,10/23/2013,"When I first got into the restaurant, I was really excited about dining. The décor was amazing, and everyone was so friendly. After we got settled in, the server came around and took our orders. The starters came out in a timely manner and everyone was enjoying themselves. After they cleared the table of starters, it took an hour plus to get entrees out. Not only did it take an hour plus, they were also missing an entrée from our party, which they made up by sending out a nice salad for my friend. The meatballs in my guests pasta were completely raw. I called the server over to tell him; he apologized and then asked if we would like something else. After another 15 minutes, our last entrée finally came out, followed shortly by the replacement food we ordered. I was already extremely upset about the timing and the mishap with raw food that after everyone was about finished, I asked for the check. Usually after dinner, I would opt to take a look at the dessert menu, ask for coffee, etc. I did not even want to bother with any of that.When the check came, I took a quick glance at it and was even more infuriated when I saw that the server had charged us for the entrée that we had a mishap with. There was no responsibility or ownership of the mistakes made that night, including making us wait an hour and more for our entrees. I am also in the service industry myself and I was very frustrated with the service. The Food was pretty good, but the service really overshadowed anything positive about the experience.I was entertaining family and guests from out of town that night, and I was very much embarrassed and unhappy with the way things turned out. I would NOT bring any guests back to this restaurant in fear of a less than smooth and perfect night.",1,0,0,Stephanie P.,"New York, NY",359,42,64
5,10/15/2013,"I signed up on yelp just now to write this review for Mercer Kitchen. I had dinner last night and I ordered: the shrimp salad, black truffle cheese pizza, and new york strip steak, and the lychee bellini. 1. The Shrimp Salad: Absolutely Delicious. A MUST HAVE. The shrimp was well cooked and I loved the seasoning. 2. Black Truffle Cheese Pizza: I heard so many great things about this pizza, so I had to order and give it a try. Easily the best menu at Mercer Kitchen. Do not leave without trying this!! I usually don't order pizza items at restaurants, but I will definitely be ordering this one again when I go back.3. NY Strip Steak: The steak was bad, burnt, and black. The $16 black truffle pizza was way better than this $49 steak. Don't waste your money. I told the server, and he brought back a new steak.. New one was much better. but I've had better steak elsewhere. Not impressed. 4. Lychee Bellini: heard from a friend this was her favorite so i decided to order it. delicious!! so yummy. 5. Raspberry Sorbet Cheesecake Dessert: Complimentary from the kitchen. Probably because of the steak. This dessert is heavenly! We weren't planning to order dessert since we were full, but I'm glad they sent it over because it was so good. yum.  Overall, great ambiance and good service. Jean-Georges never disappoints.

5,10/11/2013,"I had the most incredible meal at Mercer on Monday October 7th. I can't stop thinking about it. I wish there was a better way for me to thank the kitchen and staff, but as a lowly student with a broken foot making minimum wage, a review will have to do.My guest and I wanted to go to a restaurant to truly treat ourselves, and Mercer went over and beyond. The staff was fun and accommodating, incredibly attentive and from the bartender to runner extremely pleasant. Mercer Kitchen is also just so beautiful and sophisticated- the ceiling is especially something so unique, it's the plated cloudy glass of the sidewalk above!Starting with our drinks, my guest and I had the perfect ginger margarita- also of ABCK fame- and we couldn't stop. So tasty, so spicy, so perfect. For our dinner, we decided to go with many of the raw fish options Mercer has to offer. This is a bit of a risk for me, since I suffer from several serious and deathly food allergies- including shellfish and soy. I feel comfortable dining in a JG restaurant though, and trust the kitchen to prepare me food I otherwise would be to scared to try. The staff did the most incredible job making sure my food was safe- they even went to the extent of separating every glaze/sauce that I was allergic to so that my guest could still enjoy every bit of our meal!My dishes certainly did not miss the adjustment for my allergies however. Everything was literally perfect. Before our fish we enjoyed the creamy and perfectly balanced Burratta and the indulgent and almost ridiculously aromatic truffle pizza (I can still taste it if I close my eyes)The raw fish included the salmon chipotle rice-cake sushi- perfect little rice cakes with the most beautiful slivers of salmon laid on top. It's so fresh, and the chipotle is paired so well. The tuna rolls were even better however- clean, fresh, marbled tuna that basically melted in my mouth.  I'm so happy I don't live closer to Mercer and Jojo (Another JG restaurant whose menu features the salmon and tuna) because I would be unable to stop myself from getting these every day.We finished our meal with the barry white's tuna pizza and this might be my most favorite thing at Mercer. The crust is perfect, the Tuna is perfect, the combination of textures is perfect- I don't even know how to explain it. So tasty. In every way. One of the most satisfying dishes I can name. Our dessert was the nut-free sorbets (so fresh, how do they do that? JG pastry is on point) and some sort of salted caramel butterscotch pudding that was just so rich and light at the same time.

His dismissive attitude told a greater story.In my 8 or 9 visits to The Mercer, I've never had a bad waiter. Ever. But I've also never had (or seen) the same waiter twice.

Sad it didn't mean my expectations. We got there and got seated right away, but once we sat we waited for a while to be served. Once the waiter reached our table, he basically acted like he was in a rush and just wanted to get our orders in... ALmost forcing us to tell him everything without him even asking us what to drink. RUDE!When I asked him for some recommendations, he answered, I don't know... then paused and looked away... He was barely friendly and seemed like he could care less about our table. Once we finally ordered, he didn't even care to check on us to refill our wine glasses untill almost the time we were finish with our meal. Only to ask us if we wanted dessert.... hmmm... Ok. Anyway, so to do the food. To start we both had the fennel salad. Nothing to out of this world. It was very bland and barely had any parm cheese. Then for our entrees, she had the sea bass, which apparently she wasn't too crazy about, and I had the crab cakes appetizer since I was not very hungry. Huge disappointment. Tons of breading, very deep fried and barely any crab meat to taste. Also, it really didn't taste fresh at all. It seemed like it was previously frozen and just thrown into a deep fryer. For the price and the name I was expecting much much more. Even if the customer service wasn't that great, it would have been fine if the food surpass expectations. The sauce they topped it off with was a huge no no as well. Bland. Negative.Dessert- we got some really weird special dessert that was a bit bitter. Our fabulous waiter recommend it. Was awful.

3,8/26/2013,"I'm actually really not impressed with Mercer Kitchen and I don't think its just me or my sulky and bitter attitude because during dinner I turned to Steph P. and whispered 3.5 stars? And she nodded with affirmation and continued to go on about how she wouldn't pay $20 plus dollars for a mediocre burger. It was my good friend's 30th birthday so I was open to whatever and hoping for something outstanding. Not blown away.The décor is very modern and oddly communal. Downstairs - lots of dark marbled shiny high top tables with backed stools. Long tables with bar stools kind of made it hard for 10 people to talk to and hear each other. I caught snippets of only half of what's going on in everyone's lives at the present moment. Travesty. Not as tragic as finding someone's hair in a pile of French fries. I know I shed like a wooly mammoth but it was black and too long to be an eyelash. They replaced them but I was even too full at this point really to care for more French fries that tasted almost of McDonalds quality. Way too heavy-handed on that salt.I ended up getting exactly one over-priced glass of Malbec. Team hungover as all ungodly hell. Everyone else split a bottle of a dry white and light rose. The rose was better. Unimpressed overall with all of the wines. For appetizers a few of us split the Truffle pizza and the macaroni. The mini pizza with truffle oil and fontina cheese was really really tasty and really really small. I swear that you can get the exact same thing at Toby's in Brooklyn for a much higher quality, the same price and about 4 times larger. Macaroni - I've had better. I like how it bubbled on top but the cheese was very meh and I'm not even sure what kind it was because it did not blend well together with the sauce and everything. Burger that I ordered. It was a burger. No complaints. It tasted fine. It comes with Pepperjack cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce, onion, and Russian Dressing. The meat could have actually used more seasonings. And granted that Steph doesn't eat 'vegetables' she basically got a burger with cheddar cheese and was able to taste the flatness of it all more-so. The rest of our dining guests settled with the Niman Ranch Pork Chop, a couple orders of black sea bass, and the ravioli. I think everyone liked everything. But no one was exactly raving. No, that's a lie. The warm valrhona chocolate cake was pretty fucking amazing. Everyone was going to town on that.

For appetizers, we started with the burrata (really tasty), salmon with crispy rice (a different take, and also fresh), tuna spring roll (decent, but the soy bean puree aftertaste was a bit off-putting), and the black sea bass carpaccio (tasted alright, presentation was a bit weird). On the whole, they were quite fresh and tasty, as were the breadsticks that accompanied them. As for entrees, we had various seafood ones, which were decent but not memorable, but the rack of lamb we had was tender and tasty. The service the entire time was quite friendly and helpful.

My girl had to pour soysauce on it for some flavor. Not ordering this next time.Steak - I had the steak and was satisfied with it. It was delicious and flavorful. My friends said the same. I definitely will come back here again to try out the other items on the menu. The table next to us had the lobster and it looked and smelled amazing so I'm looking forward to trying that out.As for  the rating, I will only give them 3 stars because of the blonde girl in the front was rude and as we left, she did not say ONE word to us.

4,8/16/2013,"I was personally invited back by Mercer Kitchen's management, and I have to say my review has completely changed. I went in for dinner yesterday, and everything was great.  Our waiter was extremely courteous and kind.  He was prompt, gave great recommendations, and was interested in making sure we had a good time.Although I still maintain the brunch food was just okay, the dinner food is amazing.  For appetizer I got the sea bass carpaccio.  It was flavored with lemon and basil which are basically my favorite flavors.  My friend got the crispy rice salmon sushi, which had a wonderful flavor, but the rice texture was very weird.  I loved the crispiness, but in the inside was very mushy and just too much.  Maybe less rice would do the trick?  For our entree, my friend got the strip steak, and I got the halibut.  The steak was AMAZING.  It was cooked perfectly with a perfect mushroom sauce on top.  Just enough sauce to give the steak flavor but still let the quality of the meat shine through.  It came with fries that did not impress me.  My halibut was perfectly cooked as well with asian flavors.  Very vietnamese style, and since that's my heritage, I loved it.  We also got the mac & cheese to share.  While it is not the best mac & cheese I've ever had, it was delicious, but the portion was small for the price.  We got the chocolate cake to share for dessert.  I just love molten lava cake so I loved this.  The vanilla bean ice cream paired with it was one of the best ice creams I've had.  We also had a couple cocktails.  We got the strawberry royale, which was tasty, and a cucumber gin martini.  I loved the martini, but maybe that's just because I love gin and cucumber.  The drinks here are very carefully made and taste great so definitely worth the price. After trying the dinner food, I would definitely come back for dinner another time.  I guess I never mentioned in my last review, but the decor here is great.  It has a really nice ambiance, and hopefully all the waiters treat its customers as well as mine did last night.",0,0,0,Mary P.,"Manhattan, NY",149,38,0

Finally asked us and then sent us to the bar because our full party didn't arrive yet. When everyone came we went back to the hostesses and they didn't seem to be too nice. One even stared at my friend and looked at her up and down... I believe hostesses should be friendly and welcoming.Okay we got seated and our waiter was very nice. Our food and drinks came at a timely matter. The music level was just right. Decoration and seating setting was a little different from other restaurants. Restroom only had one sink. Therefore, there was kind of a line to wash my hands.

It really tasted like peas) Second time (August 2013): pizza with salami (HUGE portion for an app. Unbelievably tasty. The salami was so crisp, as was the thin pizza crust)Chicken with kale: very moist, delicious sauce on the plate. Lava cake: done and done. Finished in .2 seconds was so good. Also had a delicious ginger martini. BF had two vodka and thyme infused lemonades. Both yummy and super strong. Just FYI: my BF ordered off of the regular menu.

2,8/13/2013,"Underwhelmed would be the best word to describe my experience at Mercer Kitchen.  My girlfriends and I came here for RW, and the overall experience was just very nondescript.  I have a real pet peeve with places that don't seat you until your whole party arrives.  In a city like New York, where subways have more meltdowns daily than Amanda Bynes, times are merely estimates and almost never exact.  I myself always make an effort to be on time, but that's typically because I build in a LOT of extra time.  Therefore, if at least some or most of a party is there, seat them.The food too was very nondescript as well.  First, the waiter brought us each a slice of bread, and a teeny tiny dish of olive oil for the four of us to share.  Is there a global olive oil shortage that I'm not aware of due to the Greek economic woes?  Second, my starter of tomato, basil and mozzarella was bland and tasteless, and VERY heavy on the tomatoes.  A whole plate and four mozzarella balls?  Come on, let there be an equitable division between cheese and fruit.  My main course of salmon was good, but nothing I couldn't have made at home.  Likewise with my panna cotta dessert.  However, the real reason I'm giving it two stars was the service.  When I'm paying to eat somewhere, I don't appreciate being rushed.  While I can't put my finger on one example, during the whole meal, I felt like they wanted us out so they could fill our table with the next party.  I get it's RW, but have some respect.Needless to say, a trip back to Mercer Kitchen isn't on my to-do list.",1,3,0,Megan L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,79,0

The bar and entire restaurant's atmosphere was sleek and sexy - epitome of a stereotypical New York restaurant but in a great way. I really liked the open kitchen also. To drink I ordered a taste of the prosecco (the amount was perfect!) and he ordered a gin and tonic. He really loved his and mine was good as well. To start, we ordered the pizza and caprese salad - both were really really good. I got the burger and he got the chicken- he loved his chicken (and the kale too!) and my burger was so good except the onion straws were a bit salty for my taste. The desserts were my favorite part- raspberry panna cotta and chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream (or maybe it was gelato...).

This place is packed at all times. We got here at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, and the entire place was hustling and bustling. The vibe in here is awesome - trendy but not too pretentious, loud but not too loud, and well-lit but not too dark or bright. Great place to catch up if you want to have good conversation with friends because the music (I forgot if there's any) isn't too loud.We weren't too hungry, but each of us got fresh orange juice and a brunch entree each. I got the spinach/cheese omelet and my friend got the parfait. Everything was excellent. I swear they put something in the orange juice - it didn't taste like your same ole' OJ - they had to have put something in it that made it taste more sugary/carbonated. My friend's parfait was sooo good with fruit and strawberries on top and came out in this cute martini glass. My omelet was to die for - the cheese wasn't too heavy, and the spinach that they used was so fresh. I absolutely loved this place - I want to come back to try their organic turkey burger.

We arrived a few minutes early and waited at the bar.  THE DRINKS:  I ordered the cucumber mint martini, and that deserves 5 stars.  It was so refreshing, and tasty and strong.  My bf had the margarita and he also loved it. Once we were seated, the waitress was really attentive, and kept checking on us. THE FOOD:  Definitely get the Pizza-- it's so delicious and spicy and huge.  We also ordered the Tuna spring roll even though it was not on the restaurant week menu, and it was 100% worth it.  SOOOOO good.   For entrees, he had the salmon, which was the right choice.  I had the burger, and it wasn't my favorite.  It was tasty, but the burger at Kingswood is so much better.  Also, the ketchup and fries sucked a little bit.  I think they make they own ketchup, and it was not good, not good at all.  It tasted just like tomato paste-- give me Hunt's ketchup instead!  The chocolate cake for dessert was the difference between 3.5 and 4 stars.  It was perfectly warm, and flavorful and the ice cream was perfect with it. Overall, this was a great restaurant week choice!  We probably won't go back, because it wasn't the best we ever had, but solid choice to try at least once-- if you want to be trendy and have a fancy night out.",0,0,0,Julissa A.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",30,11,5

Our waiter was friendly and our overall experience was just fine ... with that being said, I didn't think there was anything too special especially it being a Jean Goerges restaurant. For appetizer, we ordered the Roasted Corn Pizza and the Peach Prosciutto. The corn pizza had a nice kick to it and the Peach Prosciutto complemented each other nicely. For our mains, we had the salmon and the burger .. both were good but nothing memorable. Our dessert was probably the most memorable part of our meal: Valrhona Chocolate Lava Cake.

The food was fine, nothing to write home about.  There was also an awkward moment, after our appetizers that another server came to ask if we wanted dessert when we were still waiting for our main course.  There seems to be little communication and coordination among staff.

While I do recommend sitting downstairs, I will add that when we first arrived they tried to seat us upstairs where the ambiance is completely different.  You are right near entrance and it's much brighter. We knew we wanted to sit downstairs and when we approached the two hostesses standing by the reservation system, they informed us that in about 30 minutes the place would be completely booked and proceeded to offer us the most undesirable seat in the house.  We took it as we didn't think it was that bad (in the direction of the bathroom and directly behind the system in which the staff place the orders but separated by glass and in very close proximity to the hostess table).  Nonetheless, an hour later we look around to see SEVERAL open tables....we counted over 10 actually.  I was really hurt that she had clearly lied to us and I did not appreciate it.  I am pretty sure she didn't have that many cancellations....Not cool, but hey, we had a nice meal and if it wasn't for this, I would give it 4 stars, not 3.",0,0,0,Mercy C.,"New York, NY",95,218,65

Pizza was a fun twist, with prosciutto and creamy roasted corn. Chicken was cooked perfectly, not dry at all - amazingly juicy with a lovely crisped skin.

The bar was so packed there was no point trying to get a drink, and while I understand it gets busy on the weekends I was expecting something more...professional, I guess. Thank god the people watching was so good, the variation of skin-tight mini dresses to shirts and jeans to suits to muscle tanks was amusing to observe.

I was a strict vegetarian for 10 years and am slowly returning to eating fish and this was  an excellent starting point. The Truffle and Fontina pizza was delicious, but I'm a sucker for truffle oil.

3,7/15/2013,"I went to Mercer Kitchen back in March and liked it enough to come back. The first time I was really happy with my margarita pizza and side of brussel sprouts, but did think that a 12 dollar small glass of juice was absolutely ridiculous. My mom and I decided to come back yesterday because she had also heard great things, and this time we were quite disappointed. FIrst of all, I'm a vegetarian, which tends to limit my options. I was happy with the selection but wanted to sample the split pea soup (because the waiter recommended it but I had never tried a pea soup before), he responded with ""no, that's not possible."" My mom and I found this kind of ridiculous, but then again they do charge up to 8 or 9 dollars for a ""taste"" of the champagne. I took his recommendation and ordered the soup and kale salad (with a substitute for the dressing, it had anchovies in it). The serving size for the expensive soup was TINY and to be honest, it tasted quite bland. I asked for some salt to try to give it some flavor. My mom was really happy with her thai coconut soup. We both ordered salads, and that's when our experience became frustrating. While the soup came out quite quickly, our salads didn't come for another 25 or 30 minutes after our soups. The couple next to us ordered burgers (after us) and got their food at least 10 or 15 minutes before us. When our salads did come, they forgot the cheese on mine. The kale salad was okay, nothing too exciting. While the waiter apologized for the wait, it was quite disappointing especially when spending that much money. The meal was over a 100 dollars, and definitely not worth the wait  or price (in our opinion). Had the service been a bit different, we definitely would've been happier.

The atmosphere; urban chic, was exquisite. We were seated beneath the sidewalk above which was interesting to watch as people walked overhead. I tried one of the house sodas, ginger lime, and it was sweet, but refreshing. For brunch I opted for an omelette which had to have been one of the fluffiest egg dishes I've enjoyed.

3,5/31/2013,"This is a tough one for me. My wife and our friends had a wonderful meal and I had a....well-I ordered the wrong dishes.I arrived early and sat at the bar while waiting for my party. This place is beautiful and has the feel of a swank NYC restaurant. I loved it. One odd moment-while I was enjoying their Malbec at the bar, one of the hostesses came over to one of the bartenders and was talking to him about her social life within my ear shot. Unprofessional and I would not expect that at this type of establishment. One more item that annoyed me. I asked for the drink check to be transferred to our table. They won't do that. Why not? Are they worried about the bartenders tip? Common sense says tip the bartender. So we had to spend several minutes settling our check at the bar and that should not be necessary here.I am usually known for ordering all the ""right"" dishes at any restaurant. At least my wife always tells me that. Well this time everyone else did and I ordered all the wrong dishes.  I started with the carpaccio of black bass. It was just okay and somewhat tasteless. The other starters at the table were the mozzarella pizza, chicken coconut soup and the tuna spring rolls. They were all fantastic. I ordered the wrong dish.For our mains I had the steamed skate fish. It was average at best and had a weird texture (I have skate often and know how it usually tastes). The other mains at the table were the halibut and the Mercer burger. Both of those were fantastic. The side dish called ""7 grains"" was also very good. I ordered the wrong dish.For dessert I ordered the butterscotch pudding and the table also had the rhubarb crisp w/basil ice cream and the Valrhona chocolate cake. They were all great and yes-this time I ordered the right dish.I will give this an ""A-OK"" even though I did not love my meal. My entire party loved every morsel.

4,5/25/2013,"I instantly felt trendier upon entering. This branch of the Jean Georges empire allows for superb people watching and appetizing takes on american style food. That is if you enjoy watching fashionistas in leopard print pants and leggings. It's actually pretty amusing. The split pea soup is the perfect treat on a cold day. The small pieces of crouton created the perfect crunch and the soup was creamy and filling. Naturally, with the traditional Jean Georges flare, the soup was finished at the table, being poured on top of the veggies and croutons. I scraped the bowl clean.I also had the salmon over crispy sushi rice. It was surprisingly salty (in a good way) with just the right kick of spicy sauce. It could have used a slightly larger cut of fish, which was almost lost with all the other competing flavors. Still, it was a great appetizer. This is going to sound funny, but the best thing I had on the menu was the side order of green beans and carrots. Whatever seasoning they put in with the butter sauce was heavenly. It was the best carrot I've ever tasted, not overly cooked, yet still tender. We actually ordered a second helping because it was that good. My sister also loved her shrimp salad.Due to time constraints, we were only looking for a light lunch, but based upon this experience, I would love to come back and attack their dinner menu.",1,0,1,Nicholas M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",83,121,15

4,5/20/2013,"Was treated to a lovely celebratory dinner here this past Saturday. First notes for the price conscious, I did not handle the bill, but dinner for 2 including 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 drinks and a sparkling water came up to a little under $200, tip not included, so if you're an indulgent taster like me, plan a comfortable budget. Ambiance was fine, clean, modern, dimly lit. I would consider it intimate but since it was a saturday it was waaay packed. This was a problem when waiting for them to prepare our table, because it was impossible to get to the bar or remain in an undisturbed corner. I tried the first still rose out of their list of 3, it was sub-par, didnt have the crisp and  fruity notes it prefer, had more of a bitterness in the aftertaste. Didnt finish my glass. I should have just played it safe with the Prosecco. Anyway, the crowd was fairly attractive, some young, more older, all affluent. The music was good, light and jazzy, very dinner and conversation appropriate, not overbearing. The service was really pleasant, all of the servers were genuinely happy to do their jobs, and the host were respectful classy gentlemen, maintaining order amongst the raucous crowd. We finally got seating in a nice corner both downstairs, right by the stairs, which was perfect, could see the bar and the whole room. Our waitress was sweet, calm, and well informed on the dishes, was able to provide her honest opinion and direct us to the favored dishes. Service was timely, not neglectful, not bothersome. Plates came out in good time and fresh off the oven. When I first heard we were coming here, I was eager and excited to try their scallop dish but was very disappointed to see that they were not offering it for the season. I substituted with the miso halibut dish which came with a dab of yummy green mashed potatoes and some green leaves and steamed white stalks of something. Wish there were more of the mashed potato, the miso flavor on the halibut was strong so I was using the mashed to counterbalance it. The flavors of the dish overall didnt seem very complimentary. Flavors aside, the texture and moisture of the hailbut was excellent. Working in reverse to save the best for last, we started our dinner with 3 appetizers: the crispy squid (aka calamari), the soft shell crab, and the steamed shrimp salad. The calamari were great, nice balance of meat and batter, great texture and flavor. Did not come with a traditional red marinara sauce, instead it was a yellow colored sauce, that tasted equally as yummy and interesting. The soft shell crab appetizer was my least favorite. Was not prepared to see a whole crab on the plate. Though the waitress said it was completely edible, I could still taste and feel the shell, that was no fun. It came on a bed of cole slaw which was a bit too acidic for my palette, in contrast to the crab. We just nibbled on this and left the majority of this dish on the side. But the STAR of the night was the steamed shrimp salad in a champagne reduction vinaigrette. WOW. First of all, let me be clear that I am not a ""salad chick"", I never look to order salads beyond lunch. Also I hate salad dressing. But I do like champagne, and shrimp, and avocado, so I gave it a try since the dish came highly recommended and we were tasting everything of interest. This. Sheet. Was. Dee. Licious. First of all the steamed shrimps are nice big and clean with some kind of creamy sauce on them. There is a heap of avocado on the plate, which everyone knows is my top crack of choice. The salad leaves were drenched in the champagne dressing, which was so perfectly tolerable and complimentary in flavors to the shrimp, not like any harsh vinegary dressings at all. I havent stopped talking about it since. Its actually the only reason I am writing this review. I never knew a salad could blow my socks off. My greedy plan was to have another salad after dinner because thats how good it was, but we were too stuffed. I finished off with tea, as usual. Theirs comes in a iron teapot, just like Megu. Very fresh tea, nice honey pourer on the side. Big teacup.  Will definitely be back to punish another salad and hopefully take on my desired scallops.",0,0,1,eLLe D.,"New York, NY",15,110,42

4,5/4/2013,"SoHo is full of pretty amazing places to dine. And the range is outstanding - cheap to break-the-bank pricey, small to large, cozy mom-and-pops style to corporate-owned chains... You can pretty much think of anything, and find it there (and that pretty much goes for most neighborhoods in the city). The Mercer Kitchen is definitely one of those places, and I was nicely surprised to have had a great experience there.I must admit, though, I feel that I must go back another time. I was actually still feeling pretty full from a somewhat unexpected late lunch prior to my reservation at MK, so I really limited myself with the menu. That said, I have to say that I had my own reservations about this place before deciding to give it a try. First off, it's a hotel restaurant --which isn't a bad thing at all, but sometimes you just don't know what you're going to get with hotel restaurants (aside from inflated F&B costs, and often-times bland food). And second, as the brainchild of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, I was doubtful that the place would be as good as the storied chef himself is. But from the minute I stepped in to that place, the experience just got better and better. From the nice and helpful hosts, to the accommodating and super informed servers, and even to the careful busboys (seriously, my water glass was never empty) - the service made the experience great from the get-go.I started with a craft cocktail -their Dark & Stormy... which was fine. Nothing special, honestly, but then again I wasn't exactly looking to be wowed by libations at that point. It was flavorful, and actually lasted me the whole meal --which never really happens considering that I can drink like no other. My first course was the Carpaccio of Black Cod - not something I'd generally go for, but I'm glad that I did. The fish was pounded to a nice, thin layer of goodness flavored with an even mix of mint, lime and coriander --all perfect flavors for fish. The carpaccio was extremely fresh, and served with a delicious rosemary loaf (which my server warned me about; she advised that the rosemary bread was a lot better than the bread that's served at the beginning of meals at MK, so I decided to hold off on the pre-meal bread choice). I finished the whole dish, even though I was not hungry. For my main dish, I totally took a left turn and went with something I generally would never-ever do and ordered a pizza. As much as I wanted the steamed skate, I opted for the Ricotta and Broccoli Rabe pizza. The idea was to eat a slice, and then take the rest of it back with me to my hotel room. But that didn't even happen. I must preface this by saying that I am not at all a pizza person, and I never would choose pizza unless it was in my face for free OR if the majority of the people I'm out dining with really want it. MK's pizza has definitely made me re-think my stance on pizza all-in-all, and I ended up eating the whole thing (sans crusts, of course); the ricotta and rabe played well against slices of spicy salami. The flavors were even, not one over-powering the other, and it made for a great meal (that made me want to crawl into bed and crash soon after). I couldn't do dessert, but I did order some tea to end the experience, and then I was on my way.What I loved about MK even more (aside from the food) was the ambiance. It was very city/New York -- somewhat loud with ample conversations going on all around me. It was sexily dim, but not to the point of needing to flash your cell phone in order to read the menu. As a hotel restaurant, you saw a mix of people from all kinds of places, but it was also packed with locals grabbing drinks with friends at the bar. The scene was definitely social, and it was nice to see people having a great time. It made for perfect people watching. Mercer Kitchen is sleek, sexy, yet still has a kind of casual air about it: women in stilettos or flats, and men in jackets or t-shirts. It definitely is a watering-hole for anyone, and the food -- well, the food isn't so bad either. Highly recommend.",0,0,0,Wendel L.,"Washington, DC",150,140,6

5,5/1/2013,"Nested in the heart of Soho, the Mercer Kitchen is still standing strong in terms of quality and taste. Not as crowded with the whole New York scene as it used to be; it's actually more pleasant and less of a wait to eat there now. My first time was with a date, perfect hip place then, exposed dark bricks walls and great light design for a rendezvous. During the day, daylight come from the sidewalks above your heads, pretty cool; or you can sit at street level with a nice view at the shoppers walking by, and have some glance on the hotel lobby. Lots of celebrities and models during fashion week stay there.Anytime I'm in the neighborhood, i just swing by for a bite, the raw tuna pizza is my all time favorite. And you don't need to be really hungry to indulge. It' s a beautiful crust top with a layer of wasabi sauce, slices of red tuna and shredded daikon and carrots, YUM!  Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's choices on organic vegetables and free range meat translate in the taste; shrimp salad with the champagne vinaigrette, the organic salmon dish is a burst of colors and textures... It tastes quality!If you're not into raw fish, the house burger or the turkey one are really great for a quick lunch.I think the trend of open kitchen and communal tables started here. So, of course, the place is perfect for big parties and you can watch the magic happening in the kitchen.What can I say, Jean-Georges Asian influences and his strong French culinary background will bring you the best of both worlds.",0,0,0,George C.,"New York, NY",0,36,0

Hmm.. maybe take that drink off the menu? ;)Ordered a coconut chicken soup, which is very very similar to Tom Yum soups found in other establishments. This came with rice which is so unnecessary but I guess good since the soup costs $14? hahaOrdered the Carpaccio Of Black Sea Bass: HIGHLY recommend this!! It is delicious. I love carpaccio and this reminded me of the one Morimoto served although the Morimoto one was better. It came with warm toasted bread which was amazing with the butter!Black Truffle And Fontina Cheese Pizza: YUMS! I love truffle on my pizza anyday! I love the assortment of greens on top of the pizza to give it a different kick than just the truffle flavor. It was also a good serving size to share without hindering your entree!My entree was a roasted chicken with mash potatoes and string beans. It was very standard yet delicious. Just the right amount to fill me up! The brown sauce was great because it was not too thick yet it had the right consistency for the chicken to soak up the flavors.Dessert: Chocolate Molten Cake with Vanilla ice cream. Honestly.. I wasn't too fond of the chocolate cake part. I felt as though the consistency of the flour was a tad bit too dry. But the ice cream saved the day. YAY!Love the decor on the bottom level. Started off with a couple of drinks there. The raspberry lychee bellini was awesome!

2,4/18/2013,"Every time my husband and I go to New York, we aim to go to at least one ""celebrity chef"" restaurant just to say we have.  This time around, we decided to go to The Mercer Kitchen, a restaurant associated with Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whom I know because of the few times he has been a judge on Top Chef!  I chose this restaurant because it seemed to have decent vegetarian options, as opposed to many other of the celebrity chef restaurants out there with very limited meat or seafood-focued menus. The inside was cavernous and pretty cool overall! We were seated right away, and our hostess walked us over to a corner of the restaurant that was sort of hidden.  I was worried to go to the bathroom on my own in fear I wouldn't find my table again (fortunately, the waitress walked me to it!).  Our waitress, by the way, was great- she was prompt and attentive without being overbearing. The menu had a few vegetarian options, including a raw kale salad, a pasta dish, and a variety of pizzas.  While I made my decision, I munched on some delicious, crusty rye and sourdough bread dipped in olive oil. My husband and I weren't starving, so we ordered light.  I ended up getting the tomato, basil and mozzarella pizza, which ended up being the perfect size for one person.  The pizza was OK- the crust was tasty but there was just too much of it!  The actual part of the pizza with toppings on it was way too small.  It did taste good though- the ingredients were nice and fresh.  Still, this pizza had nothing on most grilled pizzas served in Rhode Island restaurants. My husband got a burger, which he did enjoy.  It was small though!  The burger came with fries, which were served separately so I could share.The fries too were just OK- they were basic shoestring fries- but the spicy ketchup was a nice twist. I wish I had more to say about The Mercer Kitchen, but honestly, there wasn't much to say.  It's sort of disappointing when a well-reputed restaurant serves mediocre food, especially in New York, where there are so many other options, but at the same time, I find most ""celebrity chef"" restaurants I have tried in NYC to be mediocre.  We go just for the experience- not so much for the food. We didn't even bother with dessert, though we were presented with the menu.  I noticed the table next to me ordered some sort of bundt cake and it was tiny!  I decided to save my dessert calories for a bigger splurge later that night!

2,4/5/2013,"I'm going to have to preface that I came in here with a preset notion that I shouldn't expect much from the food...And unfortunately, that was definitely the case.  My date picked the spot and the atmosphere sounded great so I was still game to check it out.  We started with a light pinot noir, very nice, chosen by my date.  Our server was friendly and relatively attentive on a busy friday night.  As we perused the menu, we decided to start with the burrata and crabcake, both of which were decent but not off the charts.  The big disappointment came with the entree, the scallops...a measly 3 tiny scallops for $34 atop a pile of lentils.  It was shocking; I have seen appetizer portions of scallops that were bigger.  The broccoli rabe pizza was pretty good but nothing compared to other pizzas in NYC.  Overall, the ridiculous prices for only decent food with measly portions of the good stuff garnered MK only 2 stars.  Sorry JGV, try harder please.",2,0,0,Kristina C.,"New York, NY",49,192,2
4,4/3/2013,"I heart Mercer so much. Not for its trendy crowd appeal, or convenient location to Soho shopping, nor its celebrity magnetism. I simply enjoy the food and drinks. When I first tried Mercer, this restaurant stood out to me because of its spacious two-level layout and sort of  ""loungy"" street level entrance, brick caves downstairs, and upside down umbrellas by the full-bar. There is dining space for everyone. Communal, by the bar, in a booth, sooooo many options. I usually order the Warm Shrimp Salad which is marinated in a white truffle mixture of sorts and it is simply incredible. Sweet. Salty and the easy to eat. The full bar makes some killer cocktails and the oyster bar downstairs is always lively. My favorite time to go to Mercer is during the off time, after 9:00 PM, to just relax with a book and have a nice meal upstairs. They do take reservations here and usually can accomodate larger parties.  I find the Mercer to be a welcoming place to take a break from shopping and have both an excellent quality meal at moderate prices, and look ""stunner shade"" cool all at the same time. Thank you Mercer for treating me so well every time. I appreciate your attention to detail and great menu. P.s.

4,3/14/2013,"#FNOnyc, the streets of Soho were packed with people and I decided to give Mercer Kitchen a try. Luckily we got a table for 2 and were promptly seated in the dining area below. Loved the decor, it reminds you of sitting in an underground canal. Very cool. It was extremely loud and the place was packed like a can of sardines. Despite the crowds, the service was very prompt and efficient. While we decided on the food, we were served with olive oil and bread. You could choose between the wheat or the sourdough bread. Loved the olive oil, will pass the bread next time. We started the meal with Sweet pea soup with vegetables and croutons and the Mozzarella with local peaches and mint. The soup was piping hot and delicious. Very flavorful and not heavy at all. the croutons were well done and added that perfect crunch. Loved the serving size. Not too large or small. The Mozzarella salad was Ok. The peaches were very fresh and sweet but the mozzarella was not the softest. I have def. had better mozzarella. Carpaccio of Black Sea Bass with Lime, Coriander and Mint is excellent. Super tasty and fresh. A must try. For dinner for ordered the slow baked salmon and black truffle and fontina cheese pizza. My server asked me how i wanted the salmon and I thought that was an interesting question. I did not think there were many ways of baking a salmon well. Any case I made the mistake of saying well done. Unfortunately my salmon was on the dry side. I would say over baked. But the corn accompanying it was delicious. A great restaurant would not have over baked the fish but they did.The truffle pizza was absolutely delicious and one of the best i have eaten. Every bite was packed with flavor. I just loved it and highly recommend it. The pizza is quite small and servers only 1 person (might not be sufficient for a person if you like big portions). The crust was thin and delicious!!For desert we shared the butterscotch pudding. The pudding was a bit loose and not the right consistency but I loved the flavors. It was creamy, rich and delicious The caramel and the sea salt tasted heavenly. Super delicious combination. I'm very impressed with the service and the food was good.

3,3/14/2013,"Came her for Saturday brunch with a group of girl friends. You can tell this is a trendy spot the moment you walk through the door. We were sent downstairs to check in with the hostess. Even though our party ended up being 12-20 minutes late, we were sat right away, which we appreciated. Breakfast was great. I tried the french toast based on Yelp reviews and liked it a lot. My friend got the goat cheese omelet but asked for egg whites and we split the two dishes in 1/2. I liked the goat cheese omelet a lot and props to the restaurant for not increasing the price when we asked for the whites. My other friend had the burger which she enjoyed and the last one had eggs benedict and said it was one of the best benedict's she has ever had too. I also tried the cherry yuzu soda (non-alcoholic), which was good, but I wouldn't get it again for $6. Too sweet for a homemade soda (and I like sweet). The reason for the three star review is for the service. The waiter told us that it was policy to not split checks (fine, np) and that it was policy to not split checks evenly on the credit cards. What?  Then he says to me, AND I QUOTE, ""I don't have the time to split checks"".... you don't have the time or is it company policy? I had cash so this didn't effect me, but my friends were very annoyed and essentially two of my friends had to split the $200 bill. I have a big pet peeve for waiters who lie. Also, he was VERY pushy about drinks-- the second my friend put hers down from the last sip he was over asking if she wanted another-- hence the $200 bill.

3,3/10/2013,"For it's location smack in soho, it's kind of amazing how they can fit in restaurant this size . Although it does feel a little cramped sometimes. The menu is solid and pretty much what you would expect in a new American type restaurant. The prices were okay, (12-18 for apps, 25-50 for entrees). I expected worst damage so was pleasantly surprise. The ambience was nice, trendy and hip, fits in with the rest of soho. The upstairs didn't have too many tables and is dominated by a lounge, which looks more like a cozy sitting room with books, which was a bit different. The crowd was rowdy and loud, you almost have to yell to hear each other. The dress is a mix of casual t-shirts and jeans crowd as well as trendy soho crowd. I think this fits their style. We had a big group and had a bunch of appetizers and ordered our own entrees.I had a chance to taste a small pizza, which was doughy and cheesy. The salmon on crispy rice was yum, very asian. People generally enjoyed the cocktails also. The entrees overall was well liked and all looked great. The portions were on the small side. I'm not a big eater by any means but could still eat some more after my chop. I ordered the pork chop, it was really good, quality pork and well cooked and seasoned. No complaints there. We decided to skip the dessert.Overall, a good experience.  It's hard to differiate at this point of all the great restaurants found in NY. I'm not sure how much mercer kitchen does to make itself stand out, but it is a good restaurant nevertheless.

3,2/24/2013,"I went to this place for a Saturday brunch with two other friends. Atmosphere is urban chic and sophisticated. Think there were many European people in the restaurant when we went. It was around 3pm already so we could choose between lunch and brunch menus.We ordered one pizza to share, Mercer burgers and pancakes. Me and my friend both loved Mercer burger. When I order burger at the American restaurant I usually can't finish everything - I usually leave at least one bread unfinished - but the size was good so I could have all! French fries is nothing special but the tomato ketchup was very good. I didn't ask to them but it seemed like they are making their own Ketchup like ABC kitchen. Yet, the taste of the ketchup was way better than ABC kitchen to me.  Pizza wasn't that large either, 4 pieces for a pizza so it's good to order pizza as a light main or even appetizer to share. Overall, food was decent but didn't find anything amazing. Bloody Mary was good! I can go back to this place just to have Bloody Mary I think. Given the location of the restaurant - SOHO - it was very busy on Saturday and  none of us was very happy with the service. It's not about waiters being not friendly, more about them being super busy. We felt like we are not getting enough attention and we had to wait 15 min between Pizza and our main dishes.BOTTOM LINE: Good option to go in SOHO neighborhood if you are looking for something chic.

2,2/23/2013,"I went to Mercer Kitchen with some friends last night. The restaurant week menu was available, but I didn't love the options, so I ordered off the regular menu. We started the meal off with some cocktails, I had the pineapple mojito and my friends had the vodka lemonade. The drinks were weak and very sugary-definitely not worth the $15 they each cost. After we ordered, bread was served, which was cold and difficult to eat. For an appetizer we had the black truffle pizza. It was very flavorful with a crispy crust-probably my favorite part of the meal.  For my entree I chose the scallop dish.  When it arrived I was very surprised to see 3 tiny scallops served over VERY buttery snow peas and greens. If it was listed on the salad menu...I may have been okay with it. But for $35 DOLLARS(!!!) I was expecting a bit more.  When I took a bite I realized that the scallops were undercooked so I sent them back. The waitress was polite and quickly took them back to the kitchen.  When they came back a few minutes later...they were practically blackened..and not much better.  Luckily my friend shared her Mercer Burger with me, which was very good. If she didn't I would have left hungry!My friends ordered the haddock and salmon, which they seemed pleased with.  I was very disappointed in my meal, which made it difficult to pay the large bill at the end.

4,2/10/2013,"I will start this review by saying that this is a great restaurant.  Inviting ambiance, beautiful appointments, great (and clear) menu, and attentive and amiable staff.  I had the slow baked salmon, which was bursting with flavor.  I only wish I had more (the portion was understandably small).  The mashed potatoes were excellently, though a bit thin for my taste.  All in all the food was quite amazing, and worth coming back for.  The price was certainly reflective of the upscale quality of the restaurant.  Be prepared to spend around $40-50 per person for anything aside from the burger.  I cannot attest to the burger however, as it had sesame seeds on it.  To my fellow UC survivors and J-pouchers, the great thing about this restaurant is that they are very receptive to your food difficulties.  They asked me if I had any food difficulties and when they heard about my particular problems they made sure there was no cross-contamination.  That was much appreciated.  As far as menu items, check beforehand to make sure there is something that doesn't disturb your system.  For me that was the Salmon (soft and came with mashed potatoes as I mentioned before, flavorful and does not seem to have disturbed my stomach).  As far as bathrooms, this one has only 1 stall (bit of a problem for us UC'ers) but it is very clean and quite nice.  Could use some redesigning as you are going to hit people and potentially get hit as the doors open and close.  Fair warning.  All in all I will call this place UC friendly, just vocalize your needs and they will listen.  To summarize: amazing food, fairly pricey, UC-friendly as long as you vocalize, probably a few things on the menu for everyone.  A great pick for a celebration as long as you can afford it.",1,0,0,E A.,"New York, NY",3,12,2

Appetizer: Butternut squash soup - really goodEntree: Hake - was not impressive, fish was nicely cooked, but didn't like the vinegar rice.Dessert: Cinnamon bun - not bad, but not a fan of the carmel sauce it was covered with (just not a fan of caramel in general, so its just me)The other restaurant week menu looks better (I think they changed it after I went).Service is amazing though. All the waiters were really attentive. We had a friend who came a bit after and the rest of the party was all seated. We were on the phone with her trying to direct her where to find us and the waiter noticed and got her for us. In between courses, there was a nice flow and not long of a wait in getting the next dish. There was more than one waiter attending us, so that kept things going smoothly as well (we were only a table of 4).I was at another event before dinner, so had some snacks and drinks which made me pretty full after I had the bread and appetizer. Because of that, I only got halfway through my entree and got full. My other friends all finished most of theirs while it was clear I had a lot more on my plate. I guess the manager (or who I assume is the manager) noticed and approach our table asking if anything was wrong. I assured her I was just full, but it was great that she was concerned and attentive.",0,0,0,Katrina L.,"Manhattan, NY",175,378,98

2,1/22/2013,"I went here for restaurant week, and I'm completely astonished with the change in quality of participating restaurants over the years. In the past, it was possible to get a very good deal for a RW menu at some very fancy places that might be places for very special occasions only. That being said, I think the RW menu at Mercer is fair, but not a particularly compelling value as compared to what you might have expected even a few years ago.On the merits of the food: I wonder if the RW menu tainted my first experience at Mercer. The food was prepared typical to Jean-George's style; another addition to his empire. It's evident kitchen staff have very solid technical skills, however, many items on the menu are simply suited to assembly-line food operations and safe-eating. By that I mean I think perhaps the kitchen is very well trained, and will offer solid food, but it's not particularly soulful or impressive. Perhaps I'm beginning to wonder whether the mechanization of building such a robust portfolio of restaurants is taking a toll on the restaurants' ability to shine bright. Indeed there are too many ""safe"" options on the menu, and nothing that is particularly interesting--all of which may be good for the income statement.This isn't a foodie's paradise. You come here for a safe bet that can please your date. It's dark and sexy inside the basement, moody lighting and enough cocktails will be just right pre-clubbing. Service was professional, amiable, and inoffensive. Food was solid; appetizer pizza was loaded with truffle oil. Skate wing was prepared just fine, and the bok choy and rice was, well, bok choy and rice. The desert chocolate cake had an appropriate amount of goo in the middle to make it molten.It's the kind of food you'd want to eat if you were into 1) Ex Lax or 2) juice diets. It's like nutrients In, memories, satisfaction, and feelings Out.This RW menu is completely lacking imagination, and as such, is it perhaps a reflection on the whole menu? Based on that RW experience, I don't know whether I'd come back here and spend the big bucks--there are better values elsewhere, and if not better value, better experiences and better food. If this restaurant were a car, it would be a Pontiac Fiero--an extinct brand, underpowered, and not fun. Back in the day, it could be considered attractive, but it's a tough world in NYC.",4,1,0,Brian P.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,232,3
3,1/22/2013,"The food here is above average.

4,1/21/2013,Went here for lunch during Restaurant Week and really enjoyed it. A key to knowing if a meal will be delicious and enjoyable starts with the bread. The sourdough bread they have absolutely did not disappoint. The cheese pizza and tartare were both great appetizers. I really enjoyed my veal that was really crispy and the greens they came with made the dish really fresh. The Steamed Skate was well executed and the sauce was a nice touch when combined with the sushi rice. For dessert you can't go wrong with either the Chocolate Molten Cake or the Banana Cake with Caramel Ice Cream.

2,1/18/2013,"Taking advantage of Restaurant Week, I made a reservation here (I mean, a restaurant owned by Jean-Georges? Yes, please!). As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the maitre d' who instructed me to check in downstairs. Once I was led to my table, I decided to take notice of the ambiance, which was dark and claustrophobic. The waiters and waitresses kept on bumping into my companion, who was seated on the outer part of the table.Although there were many waiters and waitresses, the service was shoddy. It took awhile for my waitress to come to ask for our orders (which she didn't end up doing). Instead, one of the maitre d's jot down our orders instead! Ridiculous. As for my side of the order, the first meal was the butternut squash soup. It was delicious (hence, the reason for the two stars) - creamy, light, just really good. Then the miso glazed hake came out; the fish melted in my mouth beautifully. The rice was flavorful - I could definitely taste the vinegar though. However, the bok choy was a bit soggy/ overcooked. During this time, our waitress came over twice to ask how our meals were. I understood that she was being courteous, but could she please not come (both times) when the food was halfway in my mouth? I could only imagine how attractive I looked...Then there was the long wait.15 minutes passed. Okay... maybe it takes awhile to prepare the warm molten chocolate cake; I'll just sit here, wait, and look around.20 minutes passed. What...? How is it that the table behind us got their desserts first? They finished their entrees later than we did! 30 minutes... Alright, let me call over our waitress (who, by the way, was nowhere in sight during this time... but was very diligent when asking us how our meal was 30 minutes ago twice). She responded with, ""Oh, it should come out soon."" Soon?! Then she brings it out 5 minutes later! No apologies at all. The ice cream was already melting, which meant that it must've been sitting out for awhile. She even got my companion's order mixed up; he ordered the pecan bun with espresso ice cream, not the molten chocolate lava cake. When we told her about it, she replied snottily, ""Oh, you don't want the cake?"" No! He doesn't want the cake, because he didn't order the cake! Extremely frustrating. The chocolate cake and the espresso ice cream were amazing though.Although the service was less (LESS!!!) than stellar, the food was pretty good.

3,1/17/2013,"Of Vongerichten's current NYC mini-empire of restaurants, Mercer Kitchen was one of the earliest, after only his flagship Jean-Georges, and it was quite popular and well-regarded when it opened in 1998.Hidden in plain view, I've walked by its location on a busy corner of Prince and Mercer and never noticed its sleek, low-key entrance.  It may be momentarily disorienting walking in, with stairs descending directly before the door, a bar to the left of the stairs, and tables to the right.  The cafe by day and bar/lounge by night is located on this level, in a spacious and comfortable library-esque room in the back.The restaurant proper lies below, in a gorgeous subterranean space that looks like it single-handedly inspired the current Restoration Hardware style.  Despite being designed nearly 15 years ago, the layout is immediately modern and exciting, functionally divided by the stairs.  On one side, the bright open kitchen operates beside convivial communal tables, bringing the diner as close as possible to a professional kitchen yet remain comfortably surrounded by the trappings of a restaurant.  On the other side, a bustling bar scene lies adjacent to a cellar-like space of exposed brick walls and arches over cozy booths.  It is a sexy restaurant and attracts a scene.The New American brunch menu liberally employs international elements, but without breaking too much ground.  The crisp and charred pizza was delicious, lightly topped with smoked salmon on ground, fresh dill, mascarpone, and an ""everything"" crust.  Flavors and textures came together wonderfully for this.  This contrasted with a disappointing peekytoe crab crostini.  Crostinis were my summer rage, and even recently, the white anchovy crostini at Frankies 457 underscored all the reasons to pair flavorful, fresh topping with good, crusty bread.  This crostini fell flat; a generous portion of crab flavorless and over-chilled, not ideally paired with mild kambocha puree, over mediocre bread too quickly made soggy.  The hot dog's pedigree is Schaller & Weber, a German charcuterier, topped with dijon and kimchi relish.  A good hot dog on a toasted bun, but not for its price in this setting.  That cone of French fries was criminally good though.A small but diverse selection of beverages in the usual categories of custom cocktails, beers, and glasses of wines, and less usual with housemade sodas and sake.  If the refreshing and lightly sweet ginger-lime soda was any indication, those house sodas are lovely.Less so was merely adequate service that was often distracted or mechanical, and some uncomfortably long stretches between sightings of our waitress, notably while waiting to order and waiting to obtain the check.  At least the cozy nook where we sat allowed us to linger in comfort.Mercer Kitchen does not stand up to the reputation it once had, and may have lost much of its former luster.  For their ambience and location alone, it remains a worthwhile place to be seen and to socialize, with reasonably good food and drink.  If a meal is desired in destination-scarce Soho, it will serve well enough.  But to be a quality dining experience, Mercer Kitchen will need a reincarnation.",1,0,0,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616
4,1/16/2013,"A few suggestions if you're headed to Mercer Kitchen for restaurant week - my bf and I ordered different options for the app, entree, and dessert so we would try everything on the prix fixe excluding the chicken entree.APP:I never really enjoy butternut squash soup, but Mercer's butternut squash soup is incredible. Rich, creamy, flavorful - this was my favorite dish of the night. The fried shrimp app was just alright. ENTREE:I loved the miso hake (pronounced hawk, not haw-kay like I'd imagined). So incredibly delicious, and the miso glaze was perfect. The consistency of the fish was very similar to crab, but not as briny (which really bothers my rural-origined dining partner). His burger was tasty, but we both agreed the hake was better. The fries weren't particularly interesting; we ended up letting them alone after just two (me) and five (him). At this point we were both fairly full, but were swiftly presented with..DESSERT:Can't go wrong with either option. The chocolate cake houses an interior of warm oozing chocolate syrup, paired with a side of vanilla bean ice cream and a (honey? brown sugar?) tuile.  Oh my orgasmic. I thought I would be more enamored with the cinnamon bun, but it was a bit dry. It was complemented by an espresso chip ice cream, which I found tastier than the bun itself.A tip: The aforementioned menu is for weeks 1 and 3, while there are different dishes for weeks 2 and 4.

2,1/11/2013,"Last night a friend dragged me to Mercer Kitchen (I wanted to get an inexpensive but tasty kefta sandwich at Mamoun's). We got there late, after 11:30pm so we were told the large dining room on the lower floor was closed, even though there were people dining there, so we were seated in one of the tables on the small upper level of the restaurant. A few minutes later a waiter came to gives us the menu (a folded printed sheet of paper with a thin plastic cover) and ask us what we wanted to drink. A few more minutes later, after filling our empty glasses with water and bringing us a slice of cold bread with a little bowl of olive oil, it took what seems like a long time for the waiter to return and take our food order. Nothing on the menu appealed to me so I asked my friend again if he was sure he wanted to eat there and he said he did. From the sparse menu I got the highly over-priced $19 Mercer Burger at the waiter's recommendation, my friend got the turkey burger. The burgers were small, the bun tasted similar to a grocery store massed-produced bun, and bottom half of the bun on my burger was served extremely soggy, either from wet lettuce or too watery sauce placed on bottom bun. The flame-broiled beef patty of the Mercer Burger was cooked medium well on the inside like I wanted but burnt on the outside top and bottom of the patty so it tasted like it was covered with a layer of burnt charcoal, leaving a bad taste in my mouth with each bite. I liked the savory sauce on the top bun and the crispy onions but they couldn't disguise the burnt charcoal taste of the meat. After trying hard to get a waiter's attention, I sent the burger back because of the soggy bun and when I got it back, with the same, already cold and 1/3 eaten, burnt beef patty but on a new, dry bun, with no sauce on it, it tasted so bad I couldn't finish it. My friend didn't believe it tasted bad, probably thought I was exaggerating, until I persuaded him to taste it. After tasting it, he too agreed that it tasted bad. He said his turkey burger was okay but not that tasty. The fries, served in a grease stained flower pot, weren't bad but not better than fast food restaurant fries and needed another minute of frying so they would be a little crispy. After eating a few fries, I gave the rest to my friend, which he ate but even though he pretty much can eat anything, he refused to eat the rest of my burger. I'm not hard to please but know what I like, and I think that if a restaurant is over charging for the food they serve, they better serve good tasting and well prepared food. Was a long while later that the waiter returned to ask if I wanted to take the rest of my burger to go. I told him, I guess, that even though it tasted pretty bad I hated to throw food away. Didn't see him again until a long while later when we flagged him down again. I ended up letting the waiter take the burger to throw away. Maybe the food and service at this restaurant wouldn't had been so bad if we hadn't gone there so late, about half hour before midnight, when they were about to close the kitchen. We left there around 1:30am. My friend wanted to go there for the ambiance, hoping to impress me, but I wasn't impressed either by the place, the food or the service. Would have gotten a better tasting burger and fries, with a large soft drink, at Burger King, Wendy's or McDonald's for less than $9 each, instead he spent almost $50 on 2 unsatisfying burgers and fries. Even though I only ate 1/3 of my burnt burger I got a stomachache, and so did my friend, but thankfully it went away after a long walk.",1,1,0,Sonia S.,"Corona, NY",267,16,21

I went with a large group of 14 guests and the service was slacking and we found ourselves sitting there a lot longer than necessary. More than half the group opted to skip out on dessert because we were afraid it would take another hour for the dessert to come out, for us to eat, the staff to clear then get the check.I ordered the Carpaccio of Black Sea Bass with Lime, Coriander and Mint. This dish left a very favorable impression with its delicate yet powerful flavors. For my entree, I ordered the Maine Sea Scallops with Lentils, Crispy Pancetta, Lemon Crème Fraiche . 3 scallops in a pool of lentils for $35.

1,10/9/2012,bad vibes about this restaurant. let me post two incidences here. 1. around like 5PM when the restaurant is not busy the buser took away my food without asking if i was finished or not 2. this one happened recently when i was having brunch with a couple of people we had a reservation for 1pm we did not get seated until like 130pm. ordered our food as soon as we sat down because i was hungry didnt get our food until an hour later. my friend asked for ketchup to go with her omelet she didnt get the ketchup after we asked 3 times. the thing that really ticked me was that we gave our server cash for a part of the check and he thought that it was his tip we clearly specified the instruction however he failed to double check and confirm if that was instruction he automatically assumed that he deserved a nifty tip for horrible service. mercer kitchen service wise sucks a complete failure on the other hand i have to say their food is excellent,0,0,0,Elaine W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,0

4,9/26/2012,"Recently caught up with an old friend here over dinner. This experience was so much better than my first time at the Mercer Kitchen. What I really like about this place is the decor. Mercer Kitchen oozes a sleek, sexy, modern feel, with just enough dimly lit lighting to let you see your companion and whatever you ordered/ are eating. It is slightly romantic... so from a woman's perspective, if you're thinking of bringing that special lady, this is a good option- good luck!I've only come here for dinner but I've also enjoyed some drinks at the bar before hand. Great bartenders- they're all really nice and make amazing drinks. I had a gimlet which was nice, strong, and refreshing (the perfect combo!) I might come back just for drinks soon. I am all about good restaurants with a solid bar. My friend and I ordered the Crunchy Squid with black olive tartar sauce to start with. Mike was so excited, he thought he ordered us something new and amazing from the mind of Jean George. Look, I love calamari as much as the next person. Don't get me wrong- this was a very delicious start to our dinner, but what the menu should have stated is that it's just their fancy way of saying it's JUST CALAMARI with special sauce. We would have ordered something different if we had known, because we wanted something that you can't order elsewhere. I mean, the plate was still eaten clean and cleared because it was delicious, we just weren't expecting it to be calamari.For dinner, I ordered the Black Truffle and Fontina Cheese Pizza. This was amazing and it was a good sized personal pizza. If you like truffle oil or things with truffle in it, you need to order this pizza. It has the perfect balance of cheesy goodness and hints of black truffle in each bite. Mike ordered the Maine Sea Scallops with lentils, crispy pancetta, and lemon cream fraiche which melts in your mouth upon contact.

The sea scallops were good but if you have a big appetite that night, I'd opt for another entree as there are only 3 pieces. We finished it off with the Sour Cream Cheesecake with Raspberries and Raspberry Sorbet and it is such a sweet combination. I loved it! Overall I liked the food and the ambience.

3,9/16/2012,"I've been a couple times, most recently for dinner. Let's get the bad out of they way first:1) You have to be an owl to read the menu. Honestly, it's great when restaurants have that dark, sexy feeling, but 2/3 people in our party needed to get out their phones to generate enough light to read the menus.2) The dinner menu has a legitimate identity crisis. There's fish, plus pizza, plus turkey burgers with chipotle mayo, plus Asian-inspired dishes. This is a far cry from other Jean Georges restaurants. 3) The waitstaff could use a serious motivational talk. The maitre'd was great - very prompt and professional - but our waitress was talking to another young waitress, looked bothered that we were seated in her area, and continually kept interrupting us to ask for our orders, even though our menus were still open and we were mid-conversation. Also, the downstairs was about half full on Friday night at 7 PM. Not sure if that is a good or bad thing. The good1) The food IS good (even if it is all over the map). I had the tomato and mozzerella pizza and was not disappointed. My companions seemed pleased with their burger and fries and the salmon and rice starter was very good. 2) They don't rush you out. Once our waitress took our order, we were allowed to sit in peace and chat for a good hour or so. Always a plus when they are not flipping tables every 90 minutes, which they often do at trendy, reasonably priced restaurants downtown. 3) Decent eating options in SoHo can be hard to come by. The farther west you go, the better it gets, but Mercer Kitchen is one of the better places around if you don't want to go to Starbucks or a random cafe. I've also been for brunch, which I thought was better than dinner overall. It's a little dark for a morning meal, but they have standard brunch fare plus a few healthier options and it's a great start to your day of shopping.",1,0,0,Kels P.,"Manhattan, NY",10,54,5

4,8/16/2012,"I really enjoyed my experience here, minus the really tiny tables.  We were a party of 3 adults.  We had reservations.  The first table they sat us at was extremely small, not appropriate for a full dinner, probably more appropriate for just cocktails.  We requested for a larger table, so they did move us, but it looked like an inconvenience to the hostess, which was a little annoying considering there were open tables.Onto the food!  For appetizers, we shared the Tuna Springroll and the Crunchy Squid with Black Olive Tartar Sauce.  The tuna was served over this green sauce.  The tuna springroll itself was not impressive but I did love the flavors of the green sauce, whatever was in it.  The squid is just fried calamari which was pretty standard but they serve it with an olive sauce rather than marinara.  I'd recommend trying it just because the sauce is different.I asked our waitress for entree recommendations.  She recommended the pork chops and the haddock.  I was originally going to order the salmon but changed it to the ""Roasted Haddock with Black beans, swiss chard, and bok choy"".  So glad that I did because it was one of the best fish I've had at a restaurant.  The flavors were amazing, not too salty, not too bland.  Just a great combination here.  My mom ordered the pork chops which was served with a chili sauce, mustard greens, and polenta.  It's a little spicy but that's what's good about it.  I don't normally order pork chops or make them either but this was very good!  Didn't really like the polenta though but I guess that's to help cut the spice down.  Mark ordered the burger which I didn't try but he said it was nothing special.Bottom line:  I recommend this restaurant based on our food choices.  Not so much for hostess attitudes.",0,0,0,Amanda S.,"New York, NY",14,4,0

2,7/8/2012,"Went to this place for my friend's bday looking forward to enjoying a hip interior, an urban ambience, a decent service, and most of all chef JG's creative food journey at the midst of Soho; however, my expectations were maybe too high in demand for this place. When I first stepped into the so-called KITCHEN, I had to pace around for any server or receptionist to escort me with the reservation, but servers were just chatting until I stepped into them at the first floor bar. Then I went downstairs chilled at the bar for my friends to come, and then later on told the receptionist that we were ready to sit on the reserved table, but it took a time for them to recognize we were waiting for the escort. Servers were like college kids, who lacked professionalism when serving the hot plates for the customers, notifying foods with options and communicating. We even experienced one of the servers having a quarrel at the open kitchen. Although the people there seemed quite unorganized, we decided to give a chance for the cuisine. I love fine dining and try to endeavor decent gourmet as possible, so even though I don't dig star chefs, I had this high expectation of the tastes I've went through from JG. We ordered four entrees: chicken, lamb, salmon, and pork chop. Food was not that bad, but most of them were salty and above all, seriously lacked creativity for all this JG reputation. I mean again seriously. They even charged $5 for setting a plate for each person, just by bringing our b-day cake into this place. The total of $20 were charged for four vacant plates in the name of handling fee. Since it was the restaurant's policy, we finally admitted it, but the miscommunication went between the server and our table were fairly disappointing. Even the manager required to exhibit quality manners when providing services to customers. He looked brusque while taking our orders. Unpleasant man for a place like this or maybe all these issues were the reason why only four or five tables were being served on a Sunday evening at the huge accommodation. In conclusion, if you expect fine dining with quality service, you should find somewhere else. You don't even need reservation on weekend, this place looks empty, and I believe, it will keep up that vacant accommodation if they don't attain that professionalism of a leading restaurant.",0,0,0,Carol J.,"New York, NY",35,3,0
3,7/8/2012,"Why has no Yelper mentioned the gorgeously hot bartender at Mercer Kitchen who makes a fabulous ginger vodka gimlet?!?  None of the cocktails on the menu were catching my eye, so when I mention I love Moscow Mules, he suggests I try a vodka gimlet with ginger syrup.  It was delicious, and exactly what I was looking to drink.We moved from the bar to the TINY table...it looked like a low lounge table that they squished 3 of us at.  We could have used a 2nd table to hold all our plates, since we were sharing appetizers.  Instead, we resorted to rotating our plates around.  The server we had was prompt and friendly, even carried my drink to the table that was three steps away.  But I did feel like there were an awful lot of servers dressed in black standing around and not really doing anything helpful.  I had to separate a group of them who were blocking my route to the bathroom...they parted and stared me down, kinda like when you were walking down the locker hallway in high school.The appetizers were pretty good...peekytoe crab stuffed into squash blossoms which were tempura fried were a highlight, along with tuna rolls.  My entree, steamed sea bass with puréed potatoes was ok...didn't hate it but didn't love it either.  My refreshing dessert of 3 types of sorbet was not very creative but was just what I needed after all the food and appetizers.Yes, this place is expensive and the bill easily adds up and up with appetizers, drinks, desserts, etc. Ambiance is dark since we were at the bar and dining room downstairs...I was surprised when I ascended the stairs, stepped outside and it was still sunny out.  Great location in Soho amidst all the trendy and designer boutiques.",0,0,0,Lucy W.,"Atlanta, GA",18,1033,683

As for the food, I am a big fan of Jean George..I like his signature restaurant and I find Jojo to be pretty good..but in all honesty, Mercer Kitchen is nothing to alert the media about. Mercer is more of a casual place to dine. They have a lot of sandwiches and pizza on their lunch menu. Sure they are nice gourmet sandwiches and burgers but I probably would have been just as happy with a slice of good old NY pizza. I think Mercer is a fun place to go with your friends if you want a leisurely lunch to catch up but I really wouldn't make the trip from midtown just to eat at Mercer...its more of a convenience thing for me.

I won't say its the best burger I have ever had but for a restaurant burger, it is definitely towards the top of my list. It has avocado, pepper-jack, and crispy onions--all of which compliment the burger very well. As appetizers we got the mac n cheese, which was very good. The seasonal appetizer was prosciutto with mozzarella and strawberries--surprisingly amazing. The crispy rice salmon app was good but for $16, it needs to have more salmon. The rice was a bit overpowering. We also got one of the pizza's-olive. It was delicious too. For dessert we shared the strawberry shortcake and the chocolate cake.

I started out with a Vodka lemonade, which was delicious, but ended with a Cucumber Martini was was phenomenal! So I was definitely highly impressed by those. Sadly if I was for dinner and not just drinks. The food was nothing more than average and disappointing. We had several different plates: Steamed Black Sea Bass, Basil Vinaigrette, Mashed Potatoes And Cucumber, Fresh Fusilli Pasta and Rack Of Lamb.

The restaurant is much bigger than I expected. We were seated downstairs which has a fairly large bar and open kitchen. The menu has a good amount of variety. The cocktail list is interesting. The wine list is horribly overpriced. The food was prepared well and the chefs certainly pay attention to detail in the plating. I had the butternut squash soup which was solid. The salmon was cooked well. The chocolate cake was rich and delicious. Even though everything was prepared well, nothing blew me away. Everything was solid, but at full price I probably would have been a tad disappointed. My main grip with this place was the service. Our waiter certainly had an I don't care nor want to be here attitude from the start. Once we placed our drink and food orders we barely saw him again. My drink was done barely half way through the meal and the glass was removed, by our waiter, without the offering of another. If we are getting a deal on our food, don't you want to give a party the chance to order more to drink given that is full price ... guess that didn't matter much to him.

I'm not sure if they were going for something simple on purpose, but it looked like a sandwich and potato chips that I would have made at home for a rushed meal. It tasted pretty good, but the lamb I got on mine was tough and fatty and there wasn't very much. Again, it tasted good, but I think it definitely could have been done better.

Service was quick and attentive.We ordered the calamari appetizer, which was delicious. We also ordered the chilled artichoke which (I should have known) is literally just a whole raw chilled artichoke, which you can only eat a small portion of. Therefore, it is basically just a tool for eating the spicy mayo that comes on the side - I wouldn't recommend trying this app. For dinner, I had The Mercer, which is their burger, which was delicious although I have had better burgers elsewhere.Overall, it is a nice place to get dinner but they don't do anything that everyone else hasn't already tried.",1,0,1,Matt H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

For $20 I was quite disappointed in the portion size. The flavors in the burger were delicious and I wished I had more to eat.  My friends ordered a salami/proscuitto/mozzarella/basil pizza and the roasted chicken entree-  he did not finish his (although the portion size was small).

The drinks were delicious but again, the prices here are highly inflated in comparison to similar restaurants.Bottom line: There are much better, more affordable new american eateries throughout the city.

I had an amazing experience here and the food was phenomenal! Even with reservations, I still waited almost 45 minutes before I was seated. We hung out at the bar and drinks are pricey. We finally got seated and the fact that the hostess had a tray, specifically for my drink (which she took and brought to my table), just blew my mind. I knew from then on that service was going to be amazing. We ordered the salmon sushi and the tuna spring rolls as appetizers and the haddock and pork chop for entrees. Everything was amazing. I'm drooling now just thinking about it. Of the two apps, you HAVE to get the salmon sushi. They grill the rice so it's a little crunchy and the fish is super fresh. The spring rolls were also good, the tuna super fresh as well, but if I had to choose, hands down, go for the salmon. My haddock was cooked perfectly. The sauce and the mushrooms were a bit too salty, but the fish was cooked so well that I overlooked that. My friend had the pork chops which were out of this world! They were so moist and juicy and bursting with flavor. You could definitely taste the apple but it wasn't over bearing. His parmesan grits were also delicious...pretty sure I ate all of my meal and most of his.We passed on dessert, nothing really stood out to us. Worth noting: the impeccable service. They had a separate person for every task. Someone brought us bread, we had a server, then someone filled our cups, took our plates, brought our food out and gave us new silverware. As soon as we put our forks down, our plates were gone. On a busy night I can understand service being a little spotty, but there are so many people that Mercer Kitchen really has no excuse for such a thing.

3,2/16/2012,"Mercer Kitchen is good. Almost very good, but not quite. The beauty of Yelp is that over time there's a regression to the mean, or more precisely a regression to the truth. Sure, people have discerning tastes and someone is bound to have a great/awful experience but overall in the long run, things even out and the truth rises to the surface and silences the outliers to form a cohesive definitive idea of how good a place may be. After 427 reviews (and counting), Mercer Kitchen sits firmly at 3 and a half stars, and that is exactly what they are. The food here is good, it's prepared well, the menu has good variety and the attention to detail is there in the decor as well as on the plate. The service is very attentive as well, but the value isn't quite there. I ordered a Dry Aged New York strip, coming in at a cool $38. That's the most expensive piece of red meat I've ever bought and it's damn near Luger level prices so I'm expecting an amazing piece of steak. It comes out, I eat it. Tender enough, seasoned ok, nice piece of meat but just not worth $38. My date had the lamb chop, and it was decent as well. The best dish might have been the clam cocktail, it was fresh and tasty. I also ordered an Old Fashioned from the bar (good) and a chocolate lava cake (delicious). Damage came out to $100 before tax and tip. Was that meal worth $12X.XX? No, it wasn't. Mercer really relies on the traffic of the fake heeled and pretentious. I couldn't count the number of women who looked like Housewives clones, or the barely legal model types spending what little money they had on an overrated dinner. Like I said, the food was good. Some of it was excellent in fact, but at these price levels you're expecting something to blow you away and Mercer just comes up a little short.",3,1,1,Thomas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,318,136

2,2/7/2012,"Sorry but...no. This place is like a trendy cafeteria--massive, well decorated, and a mass-produced food kind of feeling. Okay, so I was here during restaurant week. But in my defense, my dining companion and I ordered from both the regular menu and the restaurant week menu. Memorable moments from the meal: waiting a really long time for our food to arrive. The fact our appetizers (calamari and black truffle fontina cheese pizza) tasted like one of the line cooks must have emptied a salt shaker onto them. Watching the least excited guy I have ever seen in my life make shrimp cocktail after shrimp cocktail, and wondering WHEN he was finally going to start shucking oysters.Okay, but for real. The food. As stated above, appetizers were way too salty. For entrees, my companion ordered the slowly baked salmon (an honest name), which other than the fact must have been really, really SLOWLY baked, was rather tasty, not quite, but almost falling apart at the poke of a knife. I confess I was not in absolute foodie mode that night--apparently that side of me irritates some of my friends (I know right, I mean I don't understand how anyone's dining experience wouldn't be enhanced by lengthy discussion on the texture of fish or the subtle notes of __[insert flavor]__, but I digress). However, I do recall noting to myself that the ""celeriac-maple puree"" and ""pink peppercorn vinaigrette"" made rather excellent compliments to the salmon. Now, my entree, the roasted organic chicken...drum roll please...just kidding don't because it sucked. I know I know, only restaurant no0BZ order roasted chicken (as reiterated by a recent Economists article on foodies and ""Mr. Bland""). But I went with our waitress's recommendation because she was pretty cool, and I am a fan of organic things, but it was just really dry chicken. I had the roasted chicken at Nougatine once--nothing like this. And the skin wasn't crispy. Who are you, fo real.Dessert was chocolate cake. Nothing special and a little dry.In hindsight, we probably should have bounced as soon as I saw the ""truffled"" fontina cheese pizza on the menu. Jean Georges himself said truffles are the most overrated restaurant menu ingredient. He totally plays favorites among his kids and Mercer Kitchen is the neglected one who doesn't get much attention, rebels, and fails. The end.",1,2,0,Lena X.,"Manhattan, NY",105,105,64

The service was great and, unlike some people have experienced, not snobby at all...although that might be because my friend and I had come stright from work and both looked put together. The ambiance was also lovely, a bit sexy and intimate but not obvious. The food was a bit of a bust though. The starters were good...I had the Tuna & Wasabi pizza and my friend had the butternut squash soup, both were the highlights of our meal. We both followed with the burger which we had figured would be the best option given that they need to produce restaurant week food cheaply and quickly...I mean even Shake Shack can do a good burger. I was wrong...the only taste I had upon my first mouthful was salt...and that is all I could taste through the whole of the half a burger and few chips that I ate!

4,2/2/2012,"Ahhh, Mercer Kitchen!  Every time we happen to be in SoHo, we try to 'pop' in and snag a table, which has usually proved to be fruitless, however this year on our annual Christmas trip, we were able to grab two seats at the bar!! What kind of luck is that?  We retreated down the stairs to escape the blustery chill of the NYC winter to warm up with an Egg Nog or two, Guess what! They have an Egg Nog cocktail and it was delish! We hopped in during the limbo hour between lunch and dinner service, but the place was jammed packed!  The space is just beautiful, dimly lit, exposed brick, an amazing vibe. We decided to accompany our drinks with some quick bites before our dinner reservations later on in the evening, which ended up in the form of a margarita pizza and some fries. I was pretty unimpressed with the flavor of such simple food and for the price versus portion size, I believe it was in the neighborhood of $12 for 4 fries.. what irritates me that much more is this a Jean George restaurant!!  The drinks however were yummy in my tummy and kept me giddy, unfortunately the bartender was MIA for most of our visit and we had to practically flag her down, granted- we were sucking them down at an alarming pace, but geez!! Of course, she was bubbly, super nice and very apologetic...well played my dear...The KITCHEN!! Ohhh, all the possibilities!! How I wish I could have such an amazing set up at home!!! The cold beige marble, the sleek stainless steel... the permeating aromas, the cleanly pressed chefs....oh wait...where were we?! You get my drift. I couldn't help by slow my stride as I pranced back to the bathroom, hold the drool please.  I couldn't help but think, how did our food come out of THAT kitchen and be so meh,  I'll let it slide and chalk it up to us being there during at an odd hour.All in all, a great time, upon our next visit, I will be sure to make reservations during prime dinner service and ask to be seated by that masterpiece of a kitchen to get a glimpse of the staff hard at work!I don't mind paying good money for ambiance and small portion sizes, but as long as it's worthwhile.

2,2/1/2012,"I spent hours* looking for a cute place to take my girlfriend for restaurant week before she left for a long business trip. And, after too much time cursing New York's tourism website and their inability to effectively show me times, locations and menus all on one page, I eventually found Mercer Kitchen and the pictures from the website indicated exactly what I want: dark, intimate and beautiful.And I'll be honest, the inside of this place is gorgeous. Absolutely stunning. The dark woods and gold accents make this a ""let's get lost at the bar"" date spot that is hard to beat. Sure, you're going to pay $14 for a cocktail, but let's remember you're in Soho and that's just what you're going to have to expect.But you know what will ruin that mood real quick-like? When dinner (eventually) arrives and your girlfriend holds up a small, no-more-than-5-oz burger and says ""this!? this is nineteen dollars?!?"".Yeah. That will totally ruin the mood.There's lots to like about this as date spot where you're going to stop for a drink, but it's probably best to avoid for food. First things first: it's split level, and the bar you walk into on the first level is far below the intimacy levels you'll get downstairs, so ignore the lady who welcomes you and head down there. But once you commit to sitting at a table, expect the following:a) to be sitting so low that, even if you're about six feet tall, you're going to have to crane your neck to stare up at your serverb) your server will most likely disappear for an extended period of time. I didn't find them to be mean, or rude, or anything but polite, but on a non-packed evening it took quite a while to find our server to get drinks, order more drinks, or get and pay for the checkc) small amounts of food for a lot of money.c.1) I understand the small food movement -- artistically designed food, packed with flavor and nuance doesn't require a giant plate of it to make it delicious. I get it, and for the most part I like it. But the burger was a burger, and the salmon was bland. Both cooked well, but otherwise nondescript. The cabbage/slaw on top was crunchy, but mostly flavorless though the sauce on the mashed potato bed was tangy.d) to feel like you're not getting your money's worth. The cabernet we had was delicious (I mean, really good stuff), but it came in a small, cocktail type glass and not a wine glass. If you're going to charge me $14 for a glass of wine, at least make it a real wine glass so I feel like I'm being treated like someone who would spend that much on a glass of wine.We ordered from the regular menu because we wanted to try some different things than were on the restaurant week menu, and particularly enjoyed the crispy salmon sushi appetizer. So it's not like Mercer Kitchen is bad in any way -- the food was fine. But a four-star environment is terribly offset by two star service and price. If there were a 2.5-star option, I'd pick that.* - Way more time than I should have.",5,2,2,Danny P.,"Falls Church, VA",307,530,191

2,1/18/2012,"I understand that while in theory Restaurant Week may sound like an enticing idea, the staff probably tends to be against it. They must mass produce some of the cheaper entrees and deal with double the volume while receiving half the tip... So it would make perfect sense while they may be miserable... however unless Jean-Georges himself demands that each person bring in their own toothbrush to scrub the toilets, there is no reason for these people to be this pissed off. (Just a quick side note. I saw the bathrooms. They were actually super clean and pretty cool so I don't even think a request like that would elicit the attitudes I experienced from the Mercer Kitchen staff.) Everyone who works here seemed in desperate need of Prozac, getting laid, or at least a solid week off. I'm sorry to be so demanding and ask you to see the cocktail list again... I know, I know I'm a real pain in the ass... heaven forbid I order more to drink, thus increasing the amount of the bill.  Rule #1: Thou shall never let my cocktail glass sit beside me empty. It's kind of like how women don't want to ask men to go home with them... we want you to do the dirty work and try to ""persuade us,"" same as I need my waitress to ""persuade me"" to have another cocktail so I don't feel like an alcoholic. I mean, let's be honest I will probably say yes, but we need to do the little dance first. Rule #2: Thou shall not serve average food. If you're going to serve average quality food it works out better if you lower the price... or at least get me a little drunk first. Note, the drunker one is the less it may take to impress him or her... come on people, everyone knows that one. How do you think the term ""beer goggles"" was invented? Rule #3: Thou shall not abuse the ""swank factor"". This one is simple, if you have a very cool sexy space don't overlook the fact that the food and drinks should reflect that.

But the food was great, the atmosphere comfortable and not snobby at all.The fish carpaccio starter (ordered by someone else) is really good and I recommend it if you want a light starter. It tasted fresh because of the lime juice. If you're not a fan of lime it might be too much lime but I liked it a lot. I had the crispy octopus and it was crispy indeed. The dough used for frying was very thin (thank god) and it had a nice lemony flavour. I was surprised how light the special mayo was. I almost decided not to order this dish because it might be to heavy and fatty but it wasn't at all. It was simply delicious. We ordered the Salmon, the burger and the haddock. As I didn't read ""roasted"" haddock I expected a light fish dish after my fried quid. Well the fish was quite heavy but mushrooms and everything around it was so delicious well flavoured and spicy. My friends were very happy with their choice. The salmon looked like a piece of art. We shared a dessert. As I remember it it was a cheescake with blood orange sorbet and fennel crumbling or so. The flavours together were unsual and it was very good. So leave so room don't eat too much and try the desserts!I've lived in Europe and I loved the service which was obviously the way you expect it in Europe. Waiters weren't talking much and I enjoyed it a lot so I could concentrate on my friends and we had a wonderful evening with lots of fun.

The food at this place is always amazing (and last night was no exception), but yesterday we had the WORST experience there.We ordered three courses; soup (he got a butternut squash soup and I got a coconut soup with chicken), pizza (black truffle with fontina), and entrees (he got roast chicken and I had angel hair pasta with mushrooms)...the soup came quickly, and then it took thirty minutes for the pizza...after that, it was another HOUR before our entrees came.In the meantime, it got INSANELY hot, so we complained about the temperature a number of times. They didn't attempt to correct the problem or offer to move our table on the first or second or even our third complaint...they waited until after our entrees had FINALLY arrived and we'd asked about the temperature for the fifth time...and even then, they said the only place we could move was to a communal table in the back. While this was happening, the lovely French couple seated next to us were getting rained on (and complaining) but no one on the restaurant's staff offered to move their table until the gentleman took to wearing his napkin over his head.Not to mention, our server NEVER addressed the problem with us. We actually only saw her when she took our order & asked once if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks.

3,12/12/2011,"I usually love Mercer Kitchen. Went there last week and had a very mixed time. The hostesses were friendly and seated us quickly, got menus, ordered drinks, etc. I started withe the cooked shrimp with champagne vinaigrette salad and it was AMAZING. I'd go back and have that alone for lunch... Then I had the turkey burger which was made a bit too rich by the russian dressing and  a bit too spicy. So, I couldn't finish it. It was a good, juicy burger so I wanted to, but the dressing just worked against it.  My friend had a crab cake that was excellent, and ""The Mercer"" the burger which looked great -- tender, juicy and perfectly cooked. Also, the fries were nice and crispy.Towards the end of the meal, the service fell apart. We ordered dessert (the awesome butterscotch pudding and donuts with chocolate dipping sauce), coffe, and tea with milk on the side. Dessert came before the coffee/tea. When the tea arrived, the milk did not. We asked the server who brought it for the milk; he disappeared. We finally asked our waitress for milk, and the server re-appeared. Dessert had been finished before I could even drink my tea. (I'm not picky, but I can't drink black tea without milk!). Then it took close to 40 minutes and two requests-- after everything was finished -- to get our check. So a slightly long lunch became VERY long and the wait was an unfortunate end to an otherwise very nice meal.

We started with the seafood platter which was stacked with lobster & shrimp and mussels, clams & oysters on the half shell. Pure perfection. For entrees, we had a variety at the table. Two people had the slow-cooked salmon and they seemed happy, but I wasn't impressed by it - based solely on looks since I didn't try it. Others had the Neiman Ranch pork chop, the lamb steak and the strip steak. I think the lamb was the weakest of the three, given the birthday boy's feedback, but he did like it. The standout dish at the table. The one that everyone else looked at longingly and thought , ""I wish I ordered that"" was mine. In a bold move, I decided against a fancy entrée and ordered the Mercer Burger. I don't eat too many burgers but I can say with absolute certainly that this was the best burger I had ever eaten. Seriously, I didn't even pay attention to the fries that came with it, and that never happens. Not to worry though, the rest of the table devoured them. Service was wonderful and they brought my husband out a free birthday dessert which is always fun. Also, and most importantly, I thought the prices were totally reasonable, which I might not have expected from a Jean-Georges restaurant.  Our friend who picked it was worried us Bostonians would have a bit of NYC sticker shock, but that was not the case at all.",0,0,1,Debra L.,"Hingham, MA",342,540,6

I ordered the Angel hair pasta with wild mushrooms and herbs and my girlfriend and friend had different salmon dishes. When my food arrived it looked like it had possibly been sitting under a heat lamp for a bit. When i tried to mix the pasta a bit it was all stuck together in a solid mass. This was disappointing. it took a bit of work to separate the pasta enough to get some bites. The flavors and mushrooms were good but after a few minutes  of eating everything had gone cold and i wasn't even halfway into my dish.My girlfriend and our friend were both not too impressed with the way their salmon was cooked. My girlfriend also said that the mound of cabbage on the top of her salmon was a bit unecessary but we figured maybe it would have gone better with the mashed potatoes that she substituted for steamed vegetables.The bourbon cider I had was good and my girlfriend said her grape mimosa was delicious.The only other thing I could say as others have written is that it's really dark in the basement. A girl fell down the stairs while we were there. i'm not sure if it was because it was too dark or if she was drunk or just plain clumsy.

Overall, the food tasted okay.  I expected a little more from a Jean-Georges establishment, so I was disappointed.  A celebrity chef drew me in, but I'm not sure if I would come back.The ambiance was nice, but the environment was a bit too loud.  We had a three person table and we had to talk into each others' ears.  It would be a nice date place, but the noise level is too loud to have an effective conversation.  I think the many times you would have to repeat yourself or shout over the clamouring would take away from the enjoyment of the dinner date.",2,0,1,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",192,385,517

4,9/10/2011,"A friend of mine hooked us up with a reservation since I kept hearing it was hard to get one. We had a reservation for 9pm for a ""great table"" set up by her connections. We checked in downstairs and were told to wait at the bar. The bar was incredibly crowded and there obviously isn't enough space for the folks waiting for tables. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated before the hostess ushered us to our table. She was very nice. DRINKSChris ordered a Japanese beer and loved it. I ordered the ginger margarita. It wasn't too sweet and I could taste the ginger. The salted rim actually added to the flavor even though I normally don't order it with my margaritas. It was a nice experiment but I went back to my Pinot Noir afterwards. FOODWe skipped the appetizers because it seemed like everything was raw. I'm not into raw sushi or carpaccio or tartars, just not me. But if you love raw food, you will definitely have to try the appetizers then. The slow baked salmon with corn pudding and cherry tomato vinagrette was AWESOME! I actually expected something with horseradish based on an earlier yelpers comment but it looks like they rotated the menu again. My man had the NY strip infused with ginger which was also very impressive. The ginger wasn't just on top or on the plate, it was actually IN the meat. MMMMMMM.   I also ordered a side of mac and cheese since I wasn't sure I would like the corn pudding. The mac was good but not the best I've had. It was very creamy under the baked crust so I would say it was okay, but too much cream in the mac reminds me of Kraft for some reason (sorry Jean George) I was also surprised at the portions. Another yelper mentioned they were pretty small, so I was expecting fancy Gordon Ramsey style food (2 bites on a plate with garnish). But to our surprise, the portions were quite hearty. We ordered a couple more drinks and decided to skip dessert (there was a Froyo truck outside).  WE GOT FREE STUFF :D (WINNING!) To our surprise, here comes a plate of cinnamon dusted donuts with a candle and the server says ""Happy Anniversary"". We look at each other confused. The anni isn't for another month. Is this ours? Was it for another table? Should we eat it? Whats going on? We stared at it for a few minutes until the waiter came back and explained it was on the house and then goes ""Happy Birthday"" and laughs with us. How nice!!! He totally didn't have to do that. He knew it was neither a birthday or anniversary and still hooked us up. That topped off a fine evening.  I made sure to hook up his tip. :) Overall, a great place to dine.

4,8/17/2011,"Rating: 4.0, Date Dined: 7/22/2011The Friday dinner date. You want to have a special evening but you also don't want to get your hopes up about anything since it is Restaurant Week. I had mixed feelings about booking Mercer Kitchen for RW, but I had never been and wanted to give it a try. This particular day it was 102F in NYC (feels like 115F). We were led down to the subterranean dining area where the air conditioners could not compete with the scorching weather, but at least there was respite with the overall coolness of being downstairs in a dimly lit cavern.Food & DrinksMy friend and I decided to go with the Restaurant Week menu with him drinking beers and me drinking white wine. We both started with the raw tuna pizza, which is exactly as described by other Yelpers. It's the size of a medium plate, the raw tuna is fresh, the mayo not too overpowering and the crust doughy but not chewy. As I had read Yelp reviews from the week before (thanks, Yelp) I decided to ditch half of the crust to save room for the main course. Normally I don't like when restaurants put chicken or salmon on their RW menu but in this case these are actually dishes that are served at Mercer Kitchen on their regular dinner menu. The chicken was moist with crispy skin and was accompanied by root vegetables and velvety mashed potatoes with a volcano of melted butter in the center ... mmm. Overall, I think it was a good dish. My salmon on the other hand was perfectly prepared. The fatty piece of fish was lightly seasoned and resting on a corn succotash. The corn was sweet, crisp and really heightened the dish. For dessert we had the warm Valrhona chocolate cake. The molten center and the ice cream flecked with vanilla bean did not disappoint.Service & AtmosphereMercer Kitchen is trendy enough for a night out but uniquely sleek-rustic given its location underground. The exposed stone, brick and archways are visually appealing. There's an open concept kitchen at one end of the restaurant with rows of communal hightop tables in that sectioned off area. I think it was occupied by a private dinner that night. We were seated side-by-side at a table wrapped in a corner curved banquette, ideal for a relaxed meal and conversation. The service was demure and prompt with no attitude. The bar area was overflowing when we arrived for our 9:00pm reservation but the tables were filled with diners engrossed in their own intimate evening.Dinner for two with 3 beers, 2 glasses of white came out to around $150. As far as RW experiences go, this was definitely one of the more pleasing ones.

I went to have a glass of wine at Mercer Kitchen's bar and he came to me asking me to leave... WHY?!!! I wasn't drunk from before plus it wasn't my first time at that place, but for sure the last, so he said employees were not allowed to have friends over at the restaurant anymore.. Which in other words means if I know people who works there I can't have dinner there? I am really confused.  I mean how does that work? I become a regular because I live near the area and I befriend some employees because they are nice to me and then the management don't appreciate my business anymore?  Its not like I'm getting anything for free, which I'm not, so why do they care? Its not that I am distracting the employees from their duties either because I barely talk to them but I am extremely concern about this kind of ""new"" management rules, which Dan said were effective two weeks ago, I don't think Jean George being an immigrant himself would appreciate his managers being SO discriminating like Dan said: ""I don't like Latin people"" I mean this country is full of immigrants who had been grand and not just restaurant managers like this Dan (I hope I knew his last name) but I think this is extremely disrespectful and discriminating behavior not letting you Latin customers have a drink at a bar just because they say ""Hi"" to your bus boy.. I am extremely disappointed and hopefully you the fair readers won't come to this place because even though it has good food thanks to Jean George, their staff is horribly discriminating and rude.  But this is not it.. Dan even TOUCHED my arm while asking me to leave and never come back!!! Wtf??!! Plus he said he would call the police because I was trespassing I mean really??! If I am trying to have dinner somewhere am I trespassing? Honestly I was completely unaware!! Wow laws really change by the minute!So to conclude, the manager on duty Dan was extremly RUDE to me as well as some employees as one of the female cooks and a guy who seemed to be a server (with a tattoo all over his arm) who were making fun of the scene outside I mean you should be ASHAMED!!! Horrible service despise the good food, too bad Jean George I will stick to spice market probably since the staff there are professional.  PD.

3,7/27/2011,"Being that this is a Jean-Georges establishment, I'd like to say that Mercer Kitchen blew me away, but it really didn't. A friend and I took advantage of lunch on Restaurant Week, and it was a pleasant visit where I left feeling comfortably full, but the dishes entrees in particular did not seem as unique as I would have expected from such a big name. With only three choices for ENTREES: salmon, chicken, and a burger, my friend and I nibbled on the salmon with a lovely cherry dressing and the roasted chicken with fresh vegetables, which were all moist and tender but quite salty. APPETIZERS: chilled pea soup and ahi tuna pizza. The presentation of the soup was by far the most exciting part of the night- a nearly empty bowl arrives on the table and the waiter pours the pea soup over a few fresh vegetables. It was delightful, but not exceptional. The ahi tuna pizza was a wonderful concept but had an overwhelming amount of sliced ginger and wasabi aioli so that the flavor of the tuna was dwarfed. DESSERTS = best part of the restaurant experience. Fresh berries with ice cream and small cookie were WONDERFUL; sweet, creamy, with a bit of tartness. Similarly, the lava cake was also delicious and scrumptiously gooey; it is a perfect choice for the chocolate lover at the table. COCKTAILS: I enjoyed the Elderflower martini, which was fine but nothing more than alright. My friend enjoyed a kumkwat mojito which was refreshing but, yet again, alright and almost a bit watered-down in flavor.The design of the two floors of Mercer Kitchen are sleek and contemporary, and we were greeted promptly upon arrival to the front door as well as downstairs by the hostess. We had made a reservation and were sat immediately at a small table nearby the stairs. Being a waitress, I was a little disappointed by the vagueness of service. There were so many people coming and going from our table, offering water or taking away the dishes, that we had no clue who to turn to if we wanted the check, another cocktail or even a napkin. Instead, we just had to wait til someone showed up, who may or may not have been just a passerby server already occupied with their own tables.Overall: middle of the road and a ""nice"" time out.

Dark woods, dim lighting, exposed brick, lots of glass--it seems to be an amalgamation of rustic & modern. Unfortunately, this place looks better than it tastes.The calamari app with the tangy & spicy lime-chili mayo was delicious. Calamari wasn't chewy at all, very tender and wasn't too greasy.Roasted baby beets with goat cheese. Basic, simple and tasty.My entree was the tuna wasabi pizza. I immediately noticed it seemed a bit undersized--not much bigger than a loaf of pita. However, it was piled and layered with raw tuna, shavings of fresh wasabi and pickled vegetables. The preparation was simple, the dish was yummy but nothing mindblowing or special.The overall sentiment around the table was a bit underwhelming. Again, high expectations for a JG restaurant, but the dishes seemed too simple, too mundane, undersized, slightly flat and overpriced.I'm a Jean-Georges fan and continue to enjoy his other restaurants--ABC Kitchen and Spice Market.... however, this one honestly didn't do it for me.2 out of 3 ain't bad.",1,0,1,Elvir C.,"New York, NY",82,145,66

Like it wasn't overly spicy/oily kind of just a taste everyone would enjoy. But omg the mashed potatoes were my favorite part - gravy was unique-in-a-good-way, not too buttery, perfect! Tried some of the food my friends got. The roasted haddock was interesting, definitely worth a try. Baby-back ribs were pretty good too. I'm not sure it's my favorite way to cook them though... although I was quite amazed by how easily the meat slid out from the bones (if you know what I mean).

Since we had made reservations, we were seated right away.The Good:- The food is generally pretty flavorful. Nothing extraordinary but pretty solid. We got the mozzarella and the crab crostini for appetizers. For entrees, we ordered one of the pizzas and the angel hair pasta.- Cocktail drinks are good. I got the Elderberry rhubard bellini and my husband got the mojito. Both really good.The Bad:- Service needs improvement. Our well-meaning, but perhaps overswamped server, forgot to get our cocktails so that the appetizers arrived long before the drinks did- When we asked for more bread to go with our mozzarrella, it arrived 15 mins later when we had already finished the appetizer. Plus, the bread was not the same kind as the original type served with the mozzarrella- We got the wrong check but the server quickly realized her mistake, so kudos to her!Redemption:- We got a cookie platter on the house for all the mess-ups",1,0,0,Richa T.,"Manhattan, NY",26,14,0

In this case though, I feel like he might just be whoring  his name out a bit. The basement eatery is super trendy, as is anything you would expect to be in SoHo.

The waitress was very sweet, but the space was seemingly understaffed as the wait for drinks, orders,  meals,  and desserts were adorned abundantly with rather pregnant pauses. And then there's the food. MK adds a sparkle of creativity on seemingly mundane dishes- sweet pea soup, black truffle mushroom pizza, a burger, tuna pizza, etc. The dishes taste exciting at first- but were all kind of bogged down with the same problems. They were either entirely too salty (as in the case with the mushroom pizza) or just entirely too small (ie the burger). Poor M was blueballed with the ravings of spare ribs, but alas, they were out. Instead, he resorted to the MK burger. What could have been passed for a large slider, presents as a $20 burger, and left the big guy trolling down the street for something more to eat after dinner.

I didn't think they baked the baguette and croissant from scratch, because they were cold on arrival. And oh, the next table, who came after us, ordered the same basket, got and finished it way before we even got ours. The highlight was that we had to (fight to) ask for butter and jams 3 times. What's up with that? And it was a $15 sad and lonely pastry basket. Then we waited for another 30-40 minutes for our brunch dishes. I wasn't expecting fast food service but I wasn't expecting this slow either. This is brunch. Great, my $15 lamb sandwich arrived. The meat was totally cold and dried up, obviously not from over-cooking, but from sitting somewhere for a little bit too long.

You'll know it when you see it on their drink menu.  I've taken my mother there, gone on a romantic date with my husband, and a double date with another couple. It's a great staple if you are looking to show your guests or friends a good time. I'm a total fan.",0,0,0,Sarah E.,"New York, NY",62,109,95
2,3/6/2011,"I've been a few times and never really felt that Mercer Kitchen was good enough to warrant the talk and attention it gets throughout NYC.Drinks and wine selection are solid - I would say this is the best part of the restaurant actually. They make great classic cocktails and have a wide choice of wines by the glass.As for the food, here's what I've tried: -  Shaved fennel salad with arugula, parmesan and mushroom - this was fine but nothing to write home about and certainly nothing that I would unknowingly pair with Jean Georges' reputation -  Roast chicken with french beans, baby carrots and mashed potatoes - again, solid and tasty but nothing special, just a typical and decently executed roast chicken -  A french cassoulet (tried during a visit when they had a visiting french chef and a complimentary additional menu from him) - this was awful. It was overly soupy and burnt. We sent it back to get a new one and the second came back again burnt, so we just gave up.

Although I would recommend the butternut squash soup with mushrooms and the wasabi cheese pizza. Do not get the chicken or the cook salmon. Also, and probably my biggest issue with the night was that the ceiling leaked on us and it was obvious that the hostess and manager knew this was an issue but still allowed us to sit in that spot. At first the hostess wanted to seat us by the bar but we asked not to be. She hesitated, but obliged and took our request to sit in the corner near the back of the restaurant. Well (and again, hindsight is 20/20) by the end of dinner we knew exactly why she hesitated to sit us there - the ceiling was leaking. Granted, it had been snowing and we were technically under the sidewalk, but still, if you KNOW the ceiling is leaking, and have even gone to the extent of hanging umbrellas upside down as ""decoration"" but really to stop the leaks, shouldn't you let your patrons know before allowing them to sit there? Thankfully my friend and I had finished dinner when the drops started to come. Still my coat was soaked and the manager simply said sorry and walked away. Not so impressed.

1,2/14/2011,"I recently had a terrible experience at Mercer Kitchen. I went on a Friday night with 3 girlfriends. We arrived on time for our reservation and the host informed us they were running behind and asked us to get a drink at the bar. We ordered a bottle of wine at the bar and were waiting for our table when the host's lackee came over to us and asked us if we wanted to sit at a table upstairs in the hotel lobby. We said that we wanted to sit in the restaurant and we didn't understand why that was a problem since there seemed to be plenty of open tables and we have a reservation.I went over to speak to the host about this and specifically asked him about 2 tables of 2 next to each other and he told me those were being reserved for a party of 12 that was coming in. After about 45 min of waiting they put us at 2 round tables, which did not fit together, directly at the bottom of the stairs with a waiter's caddy leaning up against my chair. Meanwhile, we paid for our bottle of wine at the bar and when the check came it was for a more expensive bottle and when we asked why the check was more than it should be they said yes we gave you the wrong bottle but when we showed you the bottle label you said ""yes"" so now you have to pay for the more expensive one (how's that for service).About half way through our meal I noticed that the 2 tables which the host had said were being reserved for the part of 12 had 2 groups of 2 women at them (the same as our group). I went over to the host to ask why he had told me they were reserved for a group of 12 when he clearly sat 4 women at them. He shrugged his shoulders and said the reservation changed and there's nothing I can do about it. Except I think what he could have done about it is offer us that table when it became available.To end this wonderful night we were served a bottle of wine that had gone bad and the waitress agreed it had gone bad. She called the sommelier over and he informed us that no it had not gone bad that was the way it was supposed to taste (although I've never had wine that tastes like vinegar) and instead of making a suggestion for an alternate bottle he threw the wine menu at my friend and said here pick another one. Which we did and they brought it out about 20 minutes later after we had already finished our meal. The sad part of the whole evening was that our food was really very good but the whole night was over-shadowed but the complete and utterly poor service (or lack there of) that we received.

Here's my brunch experience summarized in the factors below: - Ambiance: The decor and setting is unique and modern. The hotel is next door which is an ideal dining option if you are a guest. The library backdrop provides a genuine and comfortable setting while the downstairs area is dark and offers more of an intimate dining experience. - Service: I believe that service accounts for 40-60%, if not more, of your dining experience. Although the waiters were friendly they were not attentive. Perhaps I just expected better? - Food: Although I've only been here for brunch and breakfast, my food was nothing spectacular. I ordered the goat cheese omelet which was just okay. My oatmeal and toast at breakfast was again just fine and nothing too special. - Location: Situated at the corner of Mercer and Prince Street you're in the heart of Soho, which offers nothing but great shopping and dining options.

2,2/8/2011,"We heard this place was good and wanted to try it out... My overall reaction to the place is this: cool atmosphere, but almost too-cool service, and the food was good, but didn't blow my mind. I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese, and while it was tasty, I could've easily made it at home. My boyfriend had the crispy calimari which was also good, but not exciting in any way. It came with a chili-lime mayonnaise that was fine, but I think it would've been better with a sweet-chili or tomato-based sauce.  (I prefer the $5 calimari at my local Thai joint honestly.) Nothing exceptional or spectacular about either starter, really.For entrees, I had the roast chicken - it was good, but again, that's no surprise (it was cooked well and probably covered in butter, plus it was chicken, of course it was good.) My boyfriend had the burger which was also good, but kind of reminded me of a Shake Shack burger, which costs $4.75 vs Mercer Kitchen's $19. For the prices and reputation, I guess I expected something mind-blowing, and while the food was good, it was JUST good. Nothing I'd need to eat again or that was particularly inspiring. Also, the service was expedient and the food came at appropriate times, but the server was very ""cool,"" if you know what I mean. Not really friendly or welcoming, but I guess that's the vibe of this place. I think that if I'm gonna spend this kind of money, I'd rather eat at Cafeteria or Blue Ribbon.

4,2/5/2011,"Came here last week with my boyfriend for Restaurant Week and it definitely did not disappoint! First the space and the service were both fantastic. We were seated in the lower downstairs area and I loved that the space was illuminated by glass panels installed in the sidewalks above us. The service staff was also very casual and friendly. For the appetizers, we ordered the butternut soup and the tuna wasabi cream pizza. Both starters were phenomenal! The soup was rich but not too heavy and had a perfect amount of acidity and pepper to balance the cream. I could have simply eaten that with bread! The pizza was also a delight. When served, the dough was still hot, with a crispy yet chew texture that was reminiscent of well-made naan. The pizza was topped with a mild wasabi cream, slices of decadent, melt-in your mouth tuna and a fountain of asian-style pickled slaw. The resulting product was perfect both in terms of flavor and texture. However, after this point, the food fell slightly short. My boyfriend ordered the roast chicken and while the flavors were good and the meat was well cooked, the overall dish was rather plain and unexciting. Also, my salmon was a bit of a mismatch of flavors. It was definitely overpowered by the sweet and sour red pepper vinaigrette and the celeriac puree was thin and a bit too sweet.Finally, the desserts were good but also not spectacular. We ordered a signature Jean George Valrhona chocolate cake and an exotic fruit salad with white chocolate ice cream. While the cake was standard and delicious, the strange flowery aroma of the passion fruit juice within my salad was too strong when pitted against the bananas, kiwis and prunes. Yet, it was not terrible - the white chocolate ice cream was a nice touch. I wouldn't recommend sharing the two desserts, because the flavors conflict too much with each otherOverall, I had a great experience at Mercer Kitchen.

1,1/30/2011,"As soon as you have kids, the world is divided between places that are kid friendly and places that are not.  On a recent trip to New York with my family (including 7 and 5 year old boys), we were wandering around SoHo and decided to grab a quick bite to eat at the Mercer Kitchen.  Both my wife and I lived in New York.  We've stayed at the Mercer Hotel a couple of times and had fond memories of eating at the Mercer Kitchen.It was 2PM on a Sunday afternoon and when we got into the restaurant and took a peak downstairs, there were lots of tables.  When we asked the host for a table for 4, he took one look at us and said it would be a 30 - 40 minute wait (which is the perfect wait time to make sure the family with the hungry kids doesn't let the door hit their collective asses on the way out).  Downstairs? my wife asked... Same thing, he responded... There are a lot of reservations and the tables are all taken.  Right, I thought, all those folks coming in for the 2 PM Sunday brunch rush.  A hip looking couple walked in, asked for a table for 2, and the host said, I can seat you right away.  So - just for fun - my wife said, we'd be happy to sit at two tables for two.  Hmmm, he responded... Same deal, 30 - 40 minutes... It was obvious where this was all headed, so we left.For most of us, having kids tends to obviate any need to be hip.  And while we tend to look like... well... a family... we haven't given up all pretense of being cool.  And, while I'm familiar with the velvet rope mentality, it was shocking to encounter it on a sleepy Sunday afternoon in a neighborhood in NY where I've lived (years before the Mercer Hotel when SoHo was still a bit rough around the edges) and where we visit frequently.  In any case, the Mercer Hotel / Kitchen will never see our faces again (or the $$$ in my wallet).",1,2,1,David F.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,17,0

No. Not happening. ""Look, I don't want to sit here.... Can we sit some where else?""""We are really busy tonight. I don't know.""This is when I begin glaring at her.

3,1/27/2011,"I came here for restaurant week and had a mixed opinion. The place is kind of swanky but definitely in a more casual way. There was a wide variety of people here in a range of clothing.There are lots of different sections to the restaurant, and we were seated at a community-style, high-top table. If I came back, I probably would request to sit somewhere else, but hey, it's restaurant week and it was fine. The problem was that I was pretty far away from my date and had to really put my elbows on the table to be close enough for conversation. I was way closer to the people on either side of me than the person I came with. The service was non-invasive but prompt, which I think takes skill. Our water glasses were always full and our plates were cleared promptly and replaced by the next course in an appropriate period of time, but it was always someone different at our table. In retrospect, I'm not sure who my tip went to, because I only saw the person who took our order that one time. As for the food, another mixed review. The butternut squash soup was AMAZING. I mean. It was so good. It was creamy but not too rich as soups of this nature can sometimes be. It also wasn't overly sweet--it almost had a sweet and salty flavor to it. It had some sort of dried mushrooms in it as well--amazing. I've been craving this soup ever since and would totally come back just for it. My main course, however, was really disappointing. The chicken was dry and basically flavorless. I did, however, like my date's salmon better than my chicken. Then, again, the dessert was fabulous. Fresh fruit with a dollop of white chocolate ice cream that was just sweet enough. So good. I'd come back and order off the full menu.

4,1/27/2011,"Caveat - This was my first Jean-Gorges experience so I haver nothing to compare it to - and it was wonderful!Yesterday evening four of us went to Mercer Kitchen as part of Restaurant Week, and it was beyond our expectations.  The 40 person seating on ground level of the Mercer Hotel was pleasant to walk through but only about half full.  We walked down to the lower level where it seemed almost all 160 seats were full of energy and noshing on great smelling food.  After a quick 5 minute wait at the bar (we had reservations) we were seated in a back corner surrounded by exposed brick, dark wood, and Vince Young??  A few minutes through our meal he was seated next to us with some friends. When the manager came over to say hello to them, he had the courtesy to check in on us as well (we were the only two tables in the nook).  What great form!  The Restaurant Week menu, a 3 course prix-fixe of $35 had some winners on it, but for a similar price (no desert) the regular menu had great offerings as well.  From the prix-fixe menu:- For the appetizer the tuna wasabi flatbread pizza was delicious - the creamy wasabi used offering both that nasal twang but also soothing creamy feeling on the palate, with the soft tuna accented well by the lightly seasoned carrot strips.  We were surprised at the size for an appetizer, but the whole thing was finished to the last carrot strip...- For the entree my friend got the burger, cooked perfectly with the sharp aged cheese to accompany it and McDonald's like fries served in a flower pot (the McDonald's reference is supposed to be positive)!  - For dessert, the warm lava-esque cake was devoured despite having full patrons. We ordered a few items from the full menu, each better than the one before.  In no particular order:- The Steamed Shrimp Salad appetizer was recommended by our waitress, and it too was divine. The shrimp were freshly steamed and done with a light touch, making their silky texture a great match for the bed of greens with a creamy dressing.  Adorned with ripe avocado and diced tomatoes, the plate was cleaned so thoroughly it could have been used as the base for another dish of ours and you'd never know...- The Oysters were all marvelous in their own right, and the cocktail sauce had a great balance of horseradish - a bit of zing but not enough to overpower the briny oysters.  Word of note, the mignonette sauce is tasty, but avoid the chunks.  The liquid is good, but it is very heavy on the crushed peppercorns and shallots.  However, the mignonette goes great with the bread and olive oil they serve. - The Niman Ranch Pork chop over a bed of braised red cabbage with apples and bacon, and a side of parmesan grits.  This was absolutely FABULOUS!  All three combined was perfection, but each part of the dish individually could stand up on its own.  The acidity and freshness of the cabbage, the creaminess of the grits and the well seared pork chop created a wonderful cold weather palate pleaser.  - The black truffle pizza was fairly standard, on the same bread as the tuna pizza with generous swaths of truffle flavor and cheese in each bite.  It smelled wonderful coming out but was not something entirely different than what we've had before.- The Mac 'n Cheese side was voted by 3/4 as the BEST Mac 'n Cheese ever ordered at a restaurant.  The top had a firm crust though not a hard crumb crust, just broiled cheese with a dollop of what we thought was broiled cream cheese or creme fraiche.  Underneath the firm top layer was the creamiest, meltiest, cheesiest mac 'n cheese ever, with great seasoning.  This is not to be missed, and the cast iron dish was a great choice aesthetically - and it kept it warm and creamy.Overall the meal earned 5 out of 5 stars, along with a pleasant wait staff and warm yet elegant design.  I would certainly go back on any week of the year.",0,0,0,Grant B.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,128,28

To the center of me was this dark mahogany wood with an over sized pink flower centerpiece in the front, followed by the bar that didn't quite seem like the place to be if you were single (it was a weekend night too), And to the right of me was more tables that allowed for some people watching, which always turns into people abusing (all in good fun of course). Staff - Who picked their uniforms? The men are wearing black and white checkered shirts.. the girls are wearing blue jean colored shirts with a ruffle in the middle? Is this a hoe down, what gives with these outfits? On the bright side, the men are easy to find but the women, there is no excuse! The staff really is attentive, almost too attentive, they literally took my dish away as I was eating the last bite. It's a weekend, can you guys pretend to be busier? Food - The waiter comes around with a huge dish of rolls to put on each person's bread plate. While a busboy, pours extra virgin olive oil in a small dipping plate. The EVOO was delicious but sadly the bread is not, it sorta tasted like flavorless day old bread. However, the pizza dough was great.. whew what a relief! Pizza was the perfect filling appetizer, don't get the plain try the truffle and fontina or the bacon and onion one. For entrees, the pork chop was tasty, it came with a chili glaze for a slight kick and parmesean grits.. the best part of the entree was the grits, DELICIOUS! The cheeseburger was also tasty, not the best burger I've ever ate, but reminded me of a burger you would eat at a BBQ. The best part of the burger dish is how the fries come on the plate, a small ceramic flower pot, however they come cold, maybe if both people order burgers they'd be warm.. I should investigate this... maybe tomorrow. Overall, service was good, annoying but good. Food was pretty good. But the best part, the bathrooms. The stall in the woman's bathroom was as big as my 1st apartment in the city, complete with a floor length mirror... making MK a REALLY great spot to end a date for the adventurous type!",2,3,1,Antonella B.,"New York, NY",649,275,162

3,12/15/2010,"I almost gave it 2 stars because of poor meat and calamari quality, but good service and culinary inventiveness pulled my rating up to 3 stars. But after all, I have to say it was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would suggest the place to anyone.We went there at 9:30 on a Tuesday night and were seated quickly without a reservation. The staff was very pleasant and always on it (oh yeah, I absolutely love the uniforms - checkered shirts), so definitely bonus points there. The food on the other hand left me with mixed feeling. We tried two appetizers: fried calamari (they call it crispy squid) and fresh mozzarella with pineapple and prosciutto. Calamari was ok: they didn't kill it, but they didn't make it perfect either. I also think they use frozen  calamari, so it was rather boring. The sauce that comes for calamari for dipping was absolutely fantastic though.Fresh Mozarella Appetizer: best dish of the evening. The combination of the cheese with fresh pineapple, fresh basil, salty prosciutto and hints of tangy pomegranate was absolutely out of this world. Two thumbs up for that. Dinners: Baked Salmon, Mercer Burger, NY Strip.Salmon was prepared perfectly and was tender according to my friend.Mercer burger was good with spicy sauce on the bun and a good combination of dressings on it (tomato and so on). My husband ordered it rare and it was indeed rare. Purple inside, tasted almost like steak tartar that was lightly seared. Good stuff.I had the New York Strip steak (I think it was the most expensive dish, or one of them at $36) and it was the biggest disappointment of the evening. The steak was cooked rare (good), but the excitement ended there. The meet was incredibly chewy and badly trimmed (on the side with the fat there was also that white connective tissue - not sure what it is called). I have had better steaks at a diner. The sauce that accompanied the steak was excellent.Burger and steak came with shoestring fries. They were boring, but were served in terra-cotta pots lined with wax paper.

I made a reservation for Friday evening, and as a unknowing tourist made the mistake of taking a cab from the Upper West Side during rush hour. Needless to say, I was about an hour late and had called to see if we could move our reservation. They were booked solid and when we arrived, I called again to see if there was any way we could get a table. Thankfully the host was extremely accommodating and squeezed us in. We ordered an appetizer of prosciutto, figs, mozzarella and mint. It was fresh and delicious and a surprisingly perfect pairing of flavors. The highlight though was their burger. I rarely ever eat red meat, so when I do, I have really high expectations. It exceeded all of them, and was by far the best burger I've ever had. No, really. Great atmosphere. Delicious food.

Starving, we promptly ordered a black truffle and fontina pizza appetizer, which was brought out rather quickly...and did not disappoint! I even thought it was better than the truffle pizza at The Mark. Enjoying my friends company, I almost didn't realize that a half hour had gone by and we still had no entrees. We inquired with the waitress who kept saying it was on its way. Finally we see a bunch of burgers being prepared (three of us had ordered burgers) so we felt better...until the waitress brought them to the table BEHIND US! It took another half hour before she finally brought us our food. We could tell she felt terrible and was so embarrassed.Luckily the burger (I ordered the Mercer Burger and substituted cheddar for pepper jack) really hit the spot and was a terrific burger, cooked to medium rare perfection! After our burgers, they appropriately brought out two complimentary desserts, one passion fruit souffle and one warm chocolate cake, both of which were terrific. Food was at least four star worthy, but the experience was around 2.5 stars. I just don't think I could put up with all of the fuss and complications. It's not like this is a new restaurant...it's been open for far too long to still have these kinks, the restaurant is poorly run and chaotic.

The concord grape mimosa was a nice change from the standard mimosa flavors that I have seen before. Minuses: The yolks in 2 out of our 3 benedict were hard. Which is such a bummer when you are looking forward to a nice eggs bene breakfast. I felt like the food was just sort of lacking. The potatoes tasted like they had been soaked in butter.

4,11/10/2010,"I doubt this is the best that Jean-George Vongerichten can do, but what do I know, and do I even really care? This is my only Jean-George experience, and it is what it is - a modern and polished dining establishment that is evocative of slightly slicked hair and precious cuts of cloth. The food was what one might expect from an acclaimed chef. We were only a couple hours off of our plane, so there was no ambition in the belly, but we were prepared not to be disappointed. This modest expectation was fulfilled.The black truffle fontina cheese pizza was topped with a small handful of fresh frisee, which was a nice clean crunch. The crust was nice (hey, it's NYC, it better be nice), the cheese was nice, and the bits of black truffle was enough - I knew the actual truffle bits had to be a bit of a gimmick and a splash of truffle oil had to be the dominant note (it was), but hell, I'm a sucker for this kind of a dish.The sea scallops with pea greens ravioli and smoked bacon vinaigrette was a nice dish. This was not moaning-pleasure-food, but it twitched the loins just enough.The steamed skate with tarragon, sesame seed, asparagus, and sushi rice, was much the same, a twitch to the loins. In detail, a French aesthetic and technique with the flush of Asian flavors. I find it hard to resist skate since I don't see it that often at my fish monger. Everything worked - the slightly sweet and vinegary sushi rice being an excellent foil to the salt of the soy sauced fish. The asparagus stems were thick and perfectly cooked - which is rarer than one might think. Overall, my mind was not blown, but the food was faultless. If I could compare the meal to a painting (and I do not believe chefs are artists), I would say it was a minor piece by a true talent.3.5 stars rounded up.",1,0,0,Brski B.,"San Francisco, CA",6,380,0

It is probably one of the best eat's in the Soho shopping district, besides that little Japanese cafe that is on bleecker or somewhere. Anyways. The first two times were good, but nothing spectacular. Their Crunchy squid with chili-lime mayonnaise has always been good. Perfectly fried golden squid, with a decent sauce (you can actually taste the lime in the sauce, which is a refreshing contrast to the fried squid). I managed to get a decent reception even when were seated downstairs, and yelped the reviews while deciding what to eat. The Niman Ranch Cheeseburger on a Sesame Roll seemed to be a big hit, and it truly was one of the better burgers I have had in New York. My friend took a bite of it and sighed at how juicy and tender the beef was. However, the Pea Green Raviolis with Bacon Vinaigrette was on an oilier side, and at 6 bucks, it is a dish to be skipped, no matter how interesting the title sounded like. Overall, I will probably go to the place again (yes. for the 4th, 5th, 6th time, even), simply for its great ambiance, and its great location in the center of soho.

4,10/7/2010,"Surprised to see this JG get low ratings.  Is everyone getting snobbier these days?  True, MK is not the best restaurant, but is anything ever bad? No. Most of the stuff is damn delicious. And for the value (low to mid 20s) and good service too- you can't complain. I dock a star mainly because he has better lines out there, and as an avid JG groupie I kind of feel he recycles a lot of a dishes. Which is fine, because they're all good. (I'm talking about you,Truffle Fontina Pizza...). I've eaten here before, but just came here a few nights ago so the food's still fresh in my head. I'm feeling it's slightly a double whammie from his place Market, in Vancouver, where I visited recently. So this is a great place for the neighborhood (this and maybe Bathalzar and Aquagrill)- I personally kind of hate eating in Soho since I think it's a place to shop, not to eat!  Thank you MK. You walk in and you see how gorgeously decorared the Mercer Hotel is- instant hot spot for you and your friends, you and your boyfriend... you and your parents.. eh maybe not so much. My mom whose blind as a bat would complain of the too-dim lighting. Started off with some good,decent bread. Would have liked to see this with some freshly whipped butter and not olive oil/balsamic. Not a big deal (prolly good I didn't eat any butter, ha).  Then, ordered the butternut squash soup. If you like your butternut squash a bit more chunky, like I do, you'll be like ""woah, back up"" but that's how my Mom makes it at home.  This butternut squash is super blended, and thus, more refined.  Nicely dressed with trumpet mushrooms- but I was secrely wishing that this was truffle.   But I suppose that's be a clash of two, too-strongly flavored ingredients.  The soup was a good remedy for my oncoming cold, and I loved how it wasn't overly sweet. For the main, I had the skate. This was just ok.  It was a little intoxicating with all the seasame. I guess I've never had skate all steamed and healthy before. (I'm thinking of panfried skate at Artisanal , yum) so it was a weird taste for me.  It wasn't bad- it was definitely healthy but just overpowered with seasame. I guess you do need to really dress this up because otherwise skate taste really bland. I did raise this concern to our server and he sweetly assured me people like the skate. It was a good portion.  The sticky rice was kind of sour- not sure why.  The asparagus (which I swear was like a bok choy hybrid) was good too. My cousin to my left ordered the famous black truffle pizza with fontina cheese- I've had these in all the different JG restaurants. I didn't have to snag a bite that night but let me tell you this is a must-try. They do not shy away from the truffles.  You will not get cheated out of fontina. The crust is crusty, fresh and delish.  The pizza is enough for one meal. The pizza is just $16.  BOOM!  My sister to my front got the salmon, recommended by our server. Salmon to me gets old fast so I'm not the biggest fan. It's also fishy. But of course this ""slowly baked"" salmon was good.  The corn polenta underneath was the bomb and the cherry vinaigette really had a presence. My cousin to my front left had the chicken.  That looked delicious and probably had the most beautiful presentation. I don't know if it was a lot of food but she didn't eat most of it.  The cutest part of this dish was the little mound of mashed p's that had a nice pool of gravvy swimming in the middle. French beans were a nice little addition.  We ordered two sides- Mac & Cheese (when is Mac and Cheese not good?) with awesome balls of fontina I want to say- nicely baked in macaroni. Probably shareable for two or three (or one girl with a giant stomach, me) , and the pee green ravoli. This is the only thing that I thought was meh.  It was a little dry and didn't hold together well.  I guess it was healthy- there was nothing but roughly choped spinach inside with peas on the side.  I think some cheese would have been good here. They brought out some desserts.  The famous signature lava chocolate cake- I could go on for days for how delicious this is. I warn you: it's bittersweet and that's how I like it. Oozing, hot, complimentary love maker to the cold vanilla ice cream.  Classic, and devilish. We also had the passion fruit sorbet- Wooo passionfruit!  You gotta love passionfruit for this, it's really sour.  I always appreciate the worksmanship of a souffle though. I would love to see JG add the chantilly (both dessert gave birth to the same at Market) but this is a great dessert.  It's strong flavored though- even with passion fruit jelly/seeds on the accompanying ice cream. We also split the random cookie assortment-I don' t know if this is actually baked in house but among the memorable items: home made gooey chocolate chip, macademain cookie & coconut macaroon.

4,8/30/2010,"Chic, slick, hip, and expect to dine elbow-to-elbow with celebs and people with overly expensive taste (as well as the more-than-occasional Euro-tourists).The space is super-modern but well-decorated, and the upstairs area is where the action is. Downstairs is darker and the bar scene, as well as better for groups larger than three. Both spaces are equally comfortable, but the aesthetic is different.The food -- which is why most people go to restaurants, after all -- is well above average. The edamame/tuna rolls and the shrimp salad with champagne vinaigrette are our regular, go-to staples. For entrees, we usually go with the Niman Ranch burger, the omelette (we substitute ours with Gruyere and mushrooms), and occasionally we'll do the roast chicken. Barry's tuna/wasabi pizza is also a regular choice. Invariably we find an order of frites on our table.There's no question the food is excellent -- except, apparently, during restaurant week -- and the prices reflect that. Figure a basic lunch will cost about $75 for two people. Pricey but the standards here are high -- both in terms of the preparation and the decor.I'm not sure if our standards are extremely low, but we've never had a bad meal at Mercer. They regularly update the menu staples but usually the quality is so consistent that you feel a sense of deja vu when returning here months or years after your last visit.And immediately after you leave you'll likely want to return.

I had to get a dirty water dog on broadway after dinner since I left soo unsatisfied.,2,0,0,J W.,"Bellevue, WA",104,282,15
4,8/17/2010,"INTROMy grandfather always said that you outta go to the restaurants that have a lot of cars parked in front. That being said, about a year ago my friend spotted this place after having some drinks and vowed to come back years later.And that's how I ended up here.  I knew nothing about the place at all, this being my first day of living in New York, so I hadn't heard anything about the hype, Kanye or nothin'.   I think this had a lot to do with my experience at this place. SERVICEMy friend is very particular about what she wants at restaurants.  She always has lemon and a straw with her water for example.  When we arrived she and I asked to have our table switched (we didn't have a reservation) and the hosts made this happen for us. She made many other requests during the evening, all of which were quickly met.  This pleased her so much that she asked me to make mention of it in my review. The service was not incredibly showy with the food. Sometimes you get the same thing out of servers as you do from those restaurants that compliment their food on the menu like ""served with a delicious mushroom creme sauce"".  In fact, the service was very matter of fact and we actually didn't ask for recommendations.  This all gave our experience the essence of surprise.  We had no idea what was coming our way...... FOODBut we figured it out as soon as we tried the Shaved Fennel Salad with Arugala, Parmesan and Mushroom ($9).  It wasn't overly oily or heavy, and the dressing had a very subtle citrus taste -- not that I would have noticed because I was practically inhaling it!  I really haven't liked fennel salads before, because they were paired with TOO much citrus which I think overrides the taste of fennel.  I might also mention that the long thick slices of parmesan were not only good on the salad, but on their own. Next we went after our other appetizer, the Black Truffle and Fontina Cheese Pizza ($16).  This pizza was rather tiny for its price, I will admit and wasn't my favorite part of the meal.  It was incredibly delicious regardless, though and we all made an art of divying it up. After this I ordered a side of grilled vegetables  ($6) (tonight they were serving onions, squash, shitake mushrooms, and fennel).  The veggies were delicious, but they were a bit oily (and I do mean a bit) for being grilled and a little over salted.  I still enjoyed them. My friend's boyfriend got a side of Pea Green Raviolis with Bacon Vinaigrette ($6). Unfortunately, he salted them before tasting them and later found out that they were already salty.  Being from San Francisco, he didn't realize how much saltier food back east is, so that he might not need extra salt.  The raviolis fell apart and were full of hefty bunches of greens.  When I dipped them in the bacon vinaigrette, though, I swooned.  Speaking of swooning, I was talking about a burger I had in San Francisco and how it was so so good.. Then I tried my friend's burger.  She got the Niman Ranch Cheeseburger on a Sesame Roll ($18).  I took a bite and I spoke no more of other burgers, whether they were good or not.  My friend had ordered it with blue cheese, but it wasn't that that made it...it was just so juicy and tender. I took a bite of it and practically squealed! Unfortunately, the fries were not nearly as fantastic..but that's ok, that could never undermine the deliciousness of that burger!WINEI ordered a pinot by the glass, my friend got a glass of shiraz.  All the familiar grape varieties are available on the wine by the glass list, but there is only one name available for each variety (for instance they don't offer two different types of pinots by the glass).  Fortunately, my pinot was very juicy, and not too light bodied (my preference).  I have seen more impressive wine list, but the wine by the glass list is simple and fortunately what you do get is pretty good. It's by no means a wine driven restaurant, though. CONCLUSIONSo in the long run, very very good food.  I took away a star for the saltiness and the limited wine by the glass list, but that doesn't mean I won't try it again!",2,2,2,Alexandra M.,"Melrose Park, PA",818,272,30

2,7/25/2010,"As Public Enemy warns us, ""Don't believe the hype.""After reading that Kanye West was seen dining at Mercer Kitchen in AM NY, I booked reservations for a Sunday brunch here. Clearly I shouldn't have trusted mere celebrity appearance as an indicator of quality.The space is very trendy-SoHo-ooh-look-at-the-exposed-brick. I felt like a celebrity here. Since it was Restaurant Week, my friend and I decided to order from the prix fixe menu. Getting a three-course meal for $24 when an entree alone runs you $22 made penny-pinching sense. However, nothing that we ordered impressed. The tuna in the tuna wasabi pizza tasted fresh but that's about all the praise I'm going to give it. There was no wow factor. Ditto with my mozzarella basil peach salad. I could have easily sliced up a fresh peach, scooped out some balls of mozzarella and sprinkled basil leaves and balsamic vinegarette over it and called it a day, too. My friend's chicken entree was dull-dah-DULL. My salmon filet was itsy bitsy and served over what tasted like creamed corn. I could've had the warm molten cake and the mixed berry desserts at any establishment.Needless to say, just because this has the Jean-Georges label affixed to it doesn't mean that it's worth the hype.",2,0,2,Jen O.,"Portland, OR",290,183,4

4,7/20/2010,"Lunch at Mercer Kitchen was a pretty great treat. We were asked to wait for our party to all be present so we visited the bar to wait. Ended up ordering the Cucumber Mint Martini and friends had the Bellini, both were very refreshing and perfect summer drinks. Many more came to our table throughout the meal. - The Martini was a great amount of Hendricks Gin and tasted crisp with the addition of a stick of cucumber.The Restaurant Week menu here matched what the normal lunch pre-fixe would have been. We opted for the RW menu because it was a good way to split the dishes between the our party. The Tuna Wasabi pizza was a unique taster and truly satisfying, although pretty easy in concept the fresh tuna made all the difference. The peach salad seemed boring on the menu, but I thought to try it and was pleasantly surprised. The balance the vinegar and cheese brought was the perfect balance to the sweet peach.Mains were probably less impressive than the starters, which was the Roasted Chicken and Salmon, Salmon seemed well cooked. The chicken was salty. Heavily salted. Be wary if you're on a low sodium diet. Dessert was typical RW style, nothing impressive but a nice treat at the end.

The main floor is drenched with the most delicate light. This is where an afternoon beverage and dessert can really be savored. On the other hand, the lower level is more sensual, intimate and dark.

The cool industrial interior was a nice getaway from the torching outside temperatures. The downstairs dining room was dark and a lot smaller than I had originally thought, but the A/C worked so I was elated. Our group was seated right by the kitchen with the long wooden tables, which provided us a perfect view of the chefs. Each person was given a roll and then a little bowl of fresh olive oil is placed on the table. The olive oil was pretty spectacular and you could even taste the fruitiness of the olives. Salt and pepper wasn't necessary. For entrees, we ordered the Steamed Shrimp salad with avocados, tomatoes tossed with a champagne vinaigrette and the Chicken BLT sandwich. Both were delicious entrees, but I wasn't surprised or amazed by anything. All were flavors I've tasted before, but I could tell that they only used the freshest ingredients with the best quality. The mayonnaise on my sandwich was freshly made in house with a kick of cayenne pepper. The potato chips were fried shortly after my order has been placed and the herb chicken was succulent. For a Jean George restaurant, the prices were fair, but I feel like I could have found any of these entrees at Olive's, down a few blocks from Mercer Kitchen.

4,6/3/2010,"restaurantbrat.comI like pretty people as much as (if not more than) the next guy (unless the next guy is Lamar Odom). This means that you can often find me in Soho, the Meatpacking District and the general Bryant Park area during the heady, whirlwind months of February and September. Sure, when this superficial (and I don't deny a smidge of it) mentality is transplanted to restaurants, what we often end up with is a sexy venue lacking substance, packed to the brim with sexy people lacking substance. However, every once in a while you come across a place which manages to wrap the trendy surface around a menu of true class. A place where the stylish and glamorous can engage in both gossip and gastronomy. A place which emphasizes both scene and quality. Mercer Kitchen aspires to be, but ultimately falls a bit short of being, that place.The Kumquat Mojitos were a hit, an innovative twist on a summer classic. Light and refreshing and spiked with a citrusy tang from chunks of muddled fruit, I couldn't help myself. I had three. For starters, we ordered the Tuna Spring Rolls, Soft Shell Crab and Crunchy Squid  - an oceanic trio that tasted (hey hey! funnily enough!) just as you would imagine them to. The squid tasted like any other fried calamari dish I'd had at any other restaurant, only salvaged by the chili-lime mayonnaise, which I would have spread on everything I ate that night if there had been enough to go around. The crab was excellent, seasoned to crunchy perfection. The spring rolls were decent, but I would have preferred a crispier crust - the ones we had were limp and detracted from my enjoyment of the tuna core. For my entree, I had the Niman Ranch Pork Chop, which was juicy and flavorful. The smoked chilli glaze accentuated the lean and tender meat, and a thin fringe of fat lent a chewy texture and a mildly pungent aroma to the dish. A relatively plain dish in appearance--just a simple slab of meat upon an unadorned platter--but rich and complex upon further investigation. I sampled some dishes from my Dining Companions: the Breast and Confit of Duck was a monster of a dish, a sliced up brick of meat that barely fit on the plate. I had a sliver of duck breast and it was delectable, just a hint of rareness oozing from meat simultaneously firm and tender. A bite of Steamed Seabass was less inspiring, the flesh a little too dry.Quite honestly, I think Jean-Georges Vongerichten is a brilliant businessman, who has marketed his empire very well. I don't doubt he must surely be a great chef as well (although he probably hasn't run a dinner shift in ages) and a wonderful cook. The problem is, you lose the ability to micromanage when your domain gets too large and unwieldy, and it is then left to others to maintain the high standards you set yourself. Where do I place Mercer Kitchen in the gamut? In my mind, it's nowhere near a 5-star rating. It's better than 3-star - both the food and cocktails our group of five sampled were quite good (if unspectacular). It doesn't quite merit a 4-star either, as that rating, in my mind, denotes a standard of excellence that Mercer Kitchen did not hit on my visit there.

2,5/11/2010,"Went to Mercer Kitchen for my sister's birthday, there were 6 of us for 6:30pm. Upon arrival at the hostess stand, we were informed we had to be gone by 9pm. What? That's fine if you need the table for another reservation, but with 2.5 hours to go, I don't think you need to inform your current diners of the fact right away. If we happen to still be there at that point, kindly let us know and we'll be on our way. Gave us a bad taste right away. But we went to our table and focused on the cool ambiance of the place (which is very nice). Waitress was slightly rude, wanted us to order everything 5 minutes after sitting down. Had to request a cocktail menu (the mojito was very tasty). After getting drinks, we did order. Along with the entrees, we ordered appetizers and 4 sides. Things were going along fine, the apps were good. The waitress was slightly inattentive (my guess a struggling model) but we're easy going people and let it go. Finally the entrees arrived. Everyone agreed their food was good. I had the red snapper and would recommend it for anyone wanting a light fish dish. My sister had the lamb (the largest portion anyone received) and also agreed it was tasty. Halfway through eating our meals, we realize they never brought out our sides. Tried to flag down the waitress, got the manager instead. Were assured the sides were coming right out....And by ""right out"" he had the waitress put in a rush order cause she had forgotten them. As we were finishing our meals, and they still were not there, we attempted to tell the manager or waitress (whoever we could flag down) to just cancel them. Then they arrived and the manager insisted we keep them and we wouldn't be charged. Everyone tired a little bit but it just wasn't the same. What good are sides after the fact? I will say that the mac and cheese is really, really good (apparently its jean-george's grandma's secret recipe. Or at least that's what they tell anyone who inquires about it like my dad). One redeeming fact is that when I had made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, I said it was my sister's birthday, and at the end, they brought out a chocolate souffle with ice cream and a candle. Fortunately, they didn't start singing or my sister might have killed me. We paid the bill (well before 9pm I might add) and as we were leaving, we looked at it (my father usually just wants to pay and get out and did not review before passing on his card) and of course all the sides were there. Huge sigh. At that point, we'd had had it and didn't think it was worth making a fuss to have them reverse the charges. In summary (as if this isn't long enough), the food is good and the place is cool. The service however, ruined it for me. Some of the staff just had the attitude ""I'm better than you.""

3,2/4/2010,"Went for restaurant week with 3 other friends on a Monday night. Quick run through:Walking in:  Much bigger than I thought it would be - which explained a lot about the negative to mediocre reviews here.   Not enough waiters to go around to provide the sort of service I expected for the prices.  Checking in with host:  We got there on time (8:30pm) and we were told to wait until the full party was here.  Informed the host that the full party was in fact present, and he said something to the extent of  ""Oh, well, you can wait by the bar.""   I suppose this is standard but his attitude was a little flippant.  Sitting down:  Had to wait several minutes for a while for our waiter to approach us and offer menus and glasses to be filled.  I dont mind waiting for an order to be taken on a busy night, but it's difficult for us to help speed up the process if we can't peruse the menu.  Bread:  Not special, but I ate it anyway because I'm a sucker for carbsAPPS: -Tuna Wasabi Pizza - 3 out of the 4 at our table would recommend.  1 out of 4 was a wasabi wimp who thought it would be just a hint of wasabi.  It's more than a hint, but less than a punch to your sinus.  You'll most likely enjoy it if you like wasabi with your sushi -Shrimp Avocado Salad - Delicious!  My non-shrimp-loving friend enjoyed the shrimp I generously let him try.  The dressing is magical.  ENTREES: -Cheeseburger with fries - Delicious.  Huge. I got it (was sick of ordering salmon) along with one other person, and we both agreed that it was juicy without being greasy.  It came with what must have been the equivalent of 3 potatoes worth of fries.  -Salmon - Looked good, and my friend seemed satisfied with it, but  I caught him eyeing our burgers and fries a few times throughout the eveningDESSERT:-Warm vahlrona chocolate cake with ice cream - perfect combination.  the 2 who got it both complained of a ""horrible cookie"" that came in the dessert that tasted of carcinogens.  I suspect this was the cocoa bean brittle - consider yourself warned.  -Exotic fruit salad with white pepper ice cream - I'm a fan of unique ice cream flavors so I enjoyed the ice cream that tasted like.. well, pepper.  The fruit salad wasn't very exotic though - pineapple and citrus fruits mostly.  I can cut that stuff up at home.  I mostly went with this because I had a giant burger and roughly two potatoes in my stomach and felt like I was going to explode if I had chocolate cake.  In that sense it was a nice light dessert to round out the meal.  Wine:Glasses of Zinfandel & Shiraz were ordered.  Both were good with the burgers - a little on the heavy side but still somewhat fruity.  A noteworthy point of the night:One friend opted not to go with the prix fixe - he ended up foregoing an appetizer and got the breast and confit of duck with pomegranate and wild rice.  It was out of this world.  He also got a drink (homemade ginger ale) and cheesecake for dessert.  His incoherent and somewhat inappropriate moans upon tasting the entree and dessert said it all - and he ended up spending around the same amount of money as the rest of us that night.  If you feel limited by the RW menu (and its not the best of RW menus), you might want to just go for a regular entree and skip the app or dessert if tight on budget.   But I can't speak for any of the other regular entrees.Fun evening overall due to the company and atmosphere - the food was just enjoyable enough to merit thoughtful slow nodding as we acknowledged we were eating something tasty.  But from the RW menu side, no delighted moaning.  Maybe if I went back for the regular menu, but there are a ton of other great restaurants I want to try, so unless someone plans a birthday dinner there, it'll be a long time before I go back.",3,1,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

2,1/19/2010,"The vibe here is trendy, the decor is sleek and modern and the general ambiance is very good.  That's where the pros end.  Waiting an hour+ for a reservation without so much as an apology or a comped appetizer is unacceptable in my book.  I even called in advance that day to confirm the time. when the runner finally came to get us, I made a comment about the long wait and he snapped back, ""well you wouldn't want to be rushed through your dessert either."" Oh right, there must only be one table on the whole three floors that can accomodate our party of 5.  Whatever, moving on to food.  Even after looking at the menu again, I have no recollection of my appetizer, it was that unmemorable.   I shared two entree's, the sea scallops with panchetta/lentils and the pork chops. The pork was very good, tender and juicy with delicious grits, the flavors of the dish complimented eachother well and I was impressed.  The sea scallops.. eh not so much.  Instead of a full buttery texture, they were limp and the sauce base did not harmonize with the scallops.  Desserts were fine, we tried a raspberry tart and the poached pear which were both just so so, split between 5 people we failed to finish either dessert. But the real kicker was the service.  There are a lot of bus boys running around but they have the remarkable talent of constantly passing your table without paying any attention to you. The waiter may have actually been a stand-in as he was dressed like the busboys and was not at all knowledgable about the menu.  Finally, the worst part is that when the waiter brought the wine, he topped off the bottle by filleing all our glasses to the brim and proceeded to ask me immediately if I would like to order a second bottle.

I have been here before and always had great food. My parents were in from out of town and I wanted to take them to a nice dinner. Everything started off great but then my father was eating a pizza and bit into an olive pit breaking his tooth. I have worked in many high end restaurants and understand that mistakes happen, however my problem is with how the staff handled the situation. The manager was awkward and not very apologetic, he merely came up and asked us to fill out some form about what happened and gave a lame apology. No one offered us a comped dessert, drink or even take the pizza off of the bill. My father is now in pain and I have a sour taste in my mouth from this service. The worst part is our food was really good but this spoiled our whole meal.

3,1/1/2010,"I got deceived.  I called the restaurant a few days ago to confirm that the prix-fixe is available on New Year's Day.  The hostess confirmed it, but when I arrived, only the brunch menu was available, which really disappointed my intention of visiting this restaurant.  I really wanted to partake on the prix-fixe deal as I've heard great things about the desserts.  So, I went a la carte with a fennel, arugula salad.  I added avocado (for an extra $1.50).  That's fine asi I got a complimentary french roll and a dish of extra virgin olive oil.  Now I never realized it would take three tries to get the salad I asked for.  First, I specifically asked for dressing on the side, but the first try came doused with olive oil.  I love olive oil, but not if my greens are swimming in it. I was shocked when the waitress argued that I didn't make that request.  Even my mom heard me said it twice.  I had a feeling the waitress wanted me to suck it up and accept it; but luckily, the male server who brought my dish voluntarily took me back for me.  Then the second time, I realized the salad was sprinkled with sea salt. Now when did salad comes with salt?? Somebody, please tell me.  Isn't salad dressing seasoned already? The waitress stopped by probably because she saw my puzzled affect.  As bad as I left, I wanted the kitchen to correct the mistake.  Fortunately, the third time, everything came out correct.  Word of advice, be sure to repeat everything if you're making special dietary request, just to avoid any misunderstanding. My mom's chicken sandwich was decent.  Bacon wasn't too salty and the chips were fried and salted. Expensive for $14, but that's expected for the restaurant of this caliber.As for the space, my mom and I sat downstair, right next to the bar, which got really claustrophobic as more people poured in.  I felt pressured to finish my meal fast so others wouldn't be staring at me. There were many servers and busboys moving around, which was good that my water was always filled, but bad because I'm always being watched.  Although I didn't get a chance to try the prix-fixe, I probably won't return, as I always discover other restaurants that offers reasonable prix-fixes.  Although I got disappointed, but at least I eventually got what I wanted.

4,12/28/2009,"If you plan to sit upstairs in the morning take sunglasses haha. The sunshine filtering in is often wonderful, yet strong! There is a bunch of great things to say about Mercer Kitchen, number one being the kitchen that is open to the dining room. There isn't even glass separating you from everyone preparing your food; it's pretty cool to watch if you are seated on the semi-communal tables! I have been coming here for years, so I thought it was about time for a review; the place is great, that's why I keep coming back. I would describe it as good, clean and consistently excellent. If you have dietary constraints you shouldn't have a problem here, and they are also very accommodating with altering your order. I had the chicken avocado sandwich that comes with ff. It's my usual, and as always was perfect. I especially like it for the real chicken they use rather than deli meats. Mercer Kitchen has two main areas you can sit in, and a ""spillover area,"" if you will. In my opinion, if you are doing an early brunch then the best option is the upstairs area (as previously referenced). The big windows and corner location allow for beautiful natural light. Whether alone or with a group it's really nice. I love the downstairs also, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are dining on your lonesome! It has a darker more subdued environment (great in the evening). That's not to say that it's quiet, it just has a very different vibe (the bar is also downstairs). If you are coming with a big group then you shouldn't have a problem. I had my birthday here one year and it was great because they gave us one of the long community tables. Cocktails are pretty good too. They regularly make changes which is refreshing. However, I have less to say about the service...asi asi.

Again, nothing special. The chicken was over-cooked too.  My other friend and I ordered the skate which we could barely taste because of the amount of butter used.  We were so disappointed with are meal that we didn't even bother with dessert.  I do not recommend coming here.  The food is mediocre at best and really over-priced for the quality.  The only reason I gave the place two stars instead of one because of the atmosphere and the oysters which were great.",0,0,0,Rasha A.,"New York, NY",0,56,0
4,11/30/2009,"C.M. rallied A.J., S.P. and me to kill a rainy, late fall afternoon over drinks and small plates at Mercer Kitchen, since clearly our lobster brunch at Balthazar where C.M. had enjoyed 6 cups of coffee from which he was now even more ebullient than usual was apparently not enough to tide us over until dinner. Honestly, we were killing time more than hunger.After a long, contemplative, engaging post-Balthazar stroll down the lawns lining the Westside Highway discussing the brand advertising industry with J.A., I cut back into SoHo to meet the gang at Mercer Kitchen. The first to arrive, I ducked down the stairwell to the lower dining room. This enclave has the curious and ultimately mollifying property of being at once cavernous and clean-and-modern. Ideal for the adverse weather. I passed some time at the bar overhearing Scandinavian tourists with large Soho shopping bags post-mortem'ing their week in Manhattan and drinking something that was predominantly Hendrick's gin, whose cucumber infusion reminds me of the water at the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz.The gang arrived, we were promptly seated, ordered some food, including pizzas, which proved tasty, and C.M. started telling stories about S.P.'s trials and tribulations, primarily gallivanting around Europe. Some happy coincidences had allowed C.M. to (apocryphally) memorialize S.P.'s peregrination in the leading online film databases as the basis of a well-known comedy-of-errors on that very same subject of traversing the Continent, which he showed us on his iPhone.In sum, we were all reminded that we are all S.P.'s.",2,3,2,Jon F.,"San Francisco, CA",475,882,4

Unfortunately, my restaurant of choice was, lack of a better word, extremely average. The sea bass carpaccio and tuna spring roll was uninspiring and the presentation wasn't even that great - as we dug into our appetizers, we took a moment, ready to taste and proclaimed greatness, sadly, what followed was a moment of silence then awkwardness, almost like a bad first date as we stared into our plates and each pronounced the food to be average. Our entrees were slightly better, in the sense that we knew we shouldn't be too excited over it. I thought the duck was cooked and seasoned well, again, standard tastes, nothing innovative. The roast chicken was a downright disappointment, and usually it is my test for a good french restaurant. Needless to say, the dry flavorless chicken didn't even make a passing grade. As the night wore on, the dining area became more crowded, and people from the bar ""area"" (in quotation marks simply because there was a bar, and no real space for anyone to stand) spilled into our dining space which I found quite annoying.",1,1,2,Cindy C.,"New York, NY",78,287,0

The wait staff seems to be concerned with matters outside of this establishment. The food has been just so-so and the bulk of the kitchen staff seems detached as well. Who hired the loud mouth girl that spends part of her time cooking fish? The once calm, controlled kitchen atmosphere is gone.

I had the steamed tender shrimp salad of avocado, mushroom and tomato (can't tell you how surprised I was by this salad, it just really worked for me). For the entrees, she had the duck and I had the salmon; both demonstrated good cooking technique, expressive flavor and creative presentation. We had a moderately priced red wine with dinner which was very good, we both said we liked it but as with first dates, I paid more attention to her then to the wine and completely have forgotten what it was!

The ambiance at Mercer Kitchen is what makes the experience - it's in the heart of SoHo, the downstairs is dark and spacious - and you can sort of see the street level above, and there are lots of beautiful people dressed to the nines. (Sort of wish I could run into Kate Moss here one of these days.) I've always been seated downstairs - the upstairs section appears to be a little more cramped. There's also a large bar area downstairs, if you just want to hang out for drinks. The food is just average. I've never ordered off of the prix fixe menu just because none of it sounds particularly great. The omelette is good, a little bit bland though. The skate was alright, but it didn't taste fresh (it was a little fishy). The french fries are really good, but I could go to Pomme Frites and get my fix if I just wanted fries.

There was nothing to give it a little surprise or to set it apart. The french toast was all right; the crust was a bit tough and chewy, though.My date had the eggs benedict with rosemary potatoes.

She then tried to move us to the table beside that...in an empty dining room!!  I get that I'm not VIP, but don't make me feel like shxx and seat me in the corner where you know you have a leak.  (those umbrellas that I thought were decor, when I realized they were to catch the leak...) clever...but really, should you seat someone there?Thank goodness the manager must have seen my face and intervened and to which my friend graciously (after having all of her items soaked) said, 'you just prevented this evening from being very awful.'AND that brings me to another point...Dear ops mgr of JGV Rest Group - I get that things get old, this restaurant has been here for awhile - but could you fix the lock on the bathroom door in the ladies room?  and maybe just a little caulk would've helped w/the leak...I mean, that's just ghetto.  Nothing wrong w/ghetto, when I'm expecting it...but the lack of maintenance of the space is embarrassing...maybe you should visit the bathrooms at Morimoto, which happen to be one of my fav in this city.",0,0,0,K P.,"New York, NY",73,106,3

2,2/17/2009,"The food was good, but the service was awful!  I was there on a weekend night at 8:30, with a reservation and a friend.  When we got there, we had to wait several minutes for the hostess to notice that we had arrived before she sat us.  Once we sat down, our drink orders were taken quickly but it took awhile for us to get bread and we got no butter or olive oil with it.  We ordered a soup, salad, and pizza, and all were really good.  However, they were all also served at the same time, we had to ask for another bowl to share the soup (even though we specified we would be sharing it when we ordered), and the soup was cold.  After we finished our soup, they did not clear away our plates (even though we waited), so eventually we moved them to the side of the crowded table and stacked them.  When they were finally removed, we did not get an apology for the slow service.  Overall, even though the food was good, I don't think I will be going back as the service was really unacceptable.",0,0,0,C S.,"Cambridge, MA",0,4,0

I had the strange combination of prosciutto, pineapple and mozzarella. Good except for the dried bits of pineapple. I liked the dressing and the pomegranate that was present as well. The pizza looked more like a flat bread but I was told it did taste good as did the tomato soup with sourdough and cheddar. My main course was the sea scallops and although they were small I have to say they were delicious. The steak also looked very good. I shared the warm chocolate cake and that was very tasty as well.

4,1/28/2009,This place is always consistently good.  It is a little pricey but if you are looking for a safe choice when friends are in town this is the place.  Be sure to book a reservation or they will put you in the most uncomfortable table you've ever seen.,1,0,1,Myke L.,"Waterford, CT",216,51,2
2,1/27/2009,"For starters, the crowd. Why yes when I looked on Open Table it said casual but everyone (of course, I should've known better) there are like, well, models. Which I wouldn't mind, but it crosses the line when they adheres to their stereotype. From the wait staffs to the customers, everyone seemed to be beautifully uncomfortable.The decor, on the other hand, is impeccable. So impeccable, in fact, that I couldn't find the damn restaurant. I was wondering between the corner of Mercer and the J. Crew on Prince St. before finally laying my eyes on Mercer Kitchen with its black curtains. Everything inside is your New York chic with designer furniture finished with the modern touch.I'm quite touched by the service, although the busboys all have facial emotions like they are going to bite off your head, the waiters are all considerably polite (as they should be). One major let down though. I just checked my receipt and it appears that Mercer Kitchen already charged me a whopping 20% of gratuity on the check, and my waiter did not notify me that even though she had a clear knowledge that I was in a rush (i asked to have my dessert to go), in which case I left another extra 20%... in another word, I paid almost a 50% tip.Now, to the food. I ordered the raw tuna pizza with wasabi cheese for appetizer, roasted chicken for entree, and almond cake for dessert. The pizza was nice, but really isn't anything that I would rave about. The dough lacked aroma and flavor, and I tasted mint at one moment when I was finishing my pizza, but I wonder what exactly is the point of using so little of one spice when you know it'll be overpowered by another.(in this case, the wasabi) The entree lacked any speciality. The chicken and the plate as a whole looked delicious, yes, but was nothing special. Worse yet, even though the flavor was alright, the chicken tasted mushi. No, not dry, mushi. Seriously, I could probably have done a better job at roasting the chicken than they did with the chicken that I ate. I did file my complain though, and they took it very seriously (had some guy from the kitchen to come out and talk to me) +1 for service, still -1 for food.Following is my critique on the almond cake that I brought home: The cake appears to have been baked too long, and I can barely taste the almond flavor that's supposed to be in the cake. True, it might've been better if I ate the cake when they served it, but like the upper part of the cake is just like this hard chewy flour crap that I don't think I should've paid all that money for.

3,1/26/2009,"Dined here for Restaurant Week recently and it was a mediocre experience at best.  Due to a last minute change of restaurant, we were unable to secure reservations so my friend and I tried our luck by walking in at 9pm.  The wait was about 40 min, but since the downstairs bar was overcrowded, we decided to head on upstairs to see if we can grab a table to sit and chat.  Just as soon as we made our way upstairs, the hostess informed us they were unable to seat us on the inside lounge upstairs because they were ""very busy."" Naturally since her comment was ""very busy,"" I informed her that we did not need to be served, as we only wanted a place to sit.  Not sure if there was a language barrier but after a couple iterations back and forth, we decided to forgo chilling out upstairs and went back down to the main dining bar.  For restaurant week, I have to say I was not impressed by their choice of dishes.  To me, restaurant week presents the most opportune time for a restaurant to display their culinary excellence.  The selections should provide patrons with a good sampling of their specialty and leave us wanting more.  Their appetizers had creativity with the tuna sashimi pizza, which was quite good, but the entrees were all generic and nothing spectacular.  I ordered the salmon for the entrée, which was dry and overly salted.  As for the dessert, the chocolate cake was either over or under baked depending on whether it was meant to be a ""molten lava"" cake of some sort, or just plain cake.  Lastly, the bread roll that they serve at the beginning of the course tasted like it had been sitting on the counter drying out since the morning, trying to tear a piece off was a struggle.",0,0,0,grace c.,"Alhambra, CA",18,136,23

3,1/25/2009,"I tried REALLY hard to love Mercer Kitchen - but I come out now just LIKING it.  First impressions would give it a 5 star rating : the decor is amazing.  I was really impressed when I walked in and down the stairs into this cavernous yet cozy space in the basement.  I dig the exposed brick, the dark ambiance... really good looking restaurant.  We were unfortunately sat in some seats that were directly in front of the stairs.  Full disclosure, it was the coldest day of 2009 (as of yet) that day and the wind was fierce.  Although there is some heavy drapery going on in front of the doors upstairs, every time the door opened, the draft could be felt downstairs by the staircase and it was freeeezing.  Still, the draft was infrequent enough that I won't hold it against them TOO much.  Dinner was restaurant week and also to celebrate an anniversary so we had 2 of each course...  Appetizers:1)  Raw Tuna Pizza with Wasabi Cheese - Awesome!!!!  This got me so hyped up for the rest of the meal!  I thought it was scrumptious and the wasabi cheese blew me away.  Wasabi Cheese? Sounds really disgusting so I had no idea what to think but it was surprisingly great.  I will probably come back here and order this.  I see that temperature was an issue in other reviews here... but (probably b/c we were sitting in the icebox seats under the stairs) the tuna was just the right temperature!2) Pineapple Mozzarella w/ thin sliced proscuitto - I love freshly made cheese so I give this a thumbs up.  I don't think my boyfriend was as impressed.  It tasted good though and looked good enough - definitely not a stand out on the menu.Entree:1) Roast Chicken - My order of chicken was on the dry side but I liked the mashed potato that came with it and used it as a great dip to eliminate the slight dryness of the chicken.  My bf wasn't as forgiving... his first response after tasting it, ""Woah that's dry.""  It's a little ridiculous that this meal comes with a load of beans but a single carrot.  Can I please have 2 carrots?  Please?!?2) Salmon - Mashed was good - but my bf was hungry after this.  Definitely not a ""man's"" portion.Dessert:1) Almond Cake - I liked it.  Reminds me of Asian almond cake from C-town with a little bit of ice cream on top.  My only complaint is that the cake wasn't warm.  Were it so, it would taste a zillion times better.2) Chocolate Cake - Good juxtaposition of warm (cake) and cold (ice cream).  Still, this is the same dessert you see at any number of restaurants and I have seen it done better.So my meal wasn't a total disaster... why the 3 stars?  It's getting an ""OK"" from me because the bread we got was hard and cold, there were 2 people unappetizingly hardcore making out at the bar in full view of our table (good conversation piece with the 2 tables next to us), the transition between entree and dessert took an abnormally long time.  I'll probably come back non-restaurant week and try again, hopefully I can UP this to a 5 star review (I believe in this place)!!!!p.s. I got the apple cider cocktail and it was freaking awesome.",4,1,3,Diane C.,"Hoboken, NJ",244,531,7
3,1/25/2009,"I just kind of knew going in that I was going to be disappointed. There was this feeling in the air that screamed, ""Alert, Alert! Prepare to wish you had gone somewhere else for Restaurant Week!!!!""But hey, it's only $24.07, right? Still, it's $24.07, and when you add a five dollar soda, tax, and tip to the bill, suddenly the entire dining experience becomes vastly over-valued.Things started off smoothly as my friend and I were led to our table, and I immediately fell in love with the space. The bricks, the arches...I felt like I was in the basement of a creepy Cathedral. Adored it. However, things began to turn sour when our waiter approached us. Day 2 of RW and he was already an ass, already expecting my friend and I to be sucky customers banking on his exhaustion and low tips. But hey, with his attitude he didn't even deserve the ten bucks we gave him.I decided to go nuts and order a passionfruit chili soda to go with my meal. It was great. Worth five bucks? I'm not sure. Appetizers were promptly brought out, not long after the bread which took surprisingly long. My friend had a raw tuna and wasabi thin-crust ""pizza."" At first it sounded absolutely fabulous, but my tasting of it let me down. The fact that the tuna wasn't cold didn't work too well with the texture, and there wasn't enough of the supposed ""wasabi cheese"" to make the dish particularly vibrant. But hey, my friend liked it, so that's all that matters.On my end, I was extremely disappointed by my fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, pineapple and pomegranate starter. The mozzarella was tasty, but every other component was either flaccid and metallic in taste (prosciutto,) or way too acidic to be enjoyable (dried and fresh pineapple.) Then entrees arrived. Naturally because it's restaurant week, Mercer Kitchen it one of many establishments who makes an effort to offer their most boring items for the two-week-long menu. Be mindful of this. I had chicken, friend had salmon. Figures. The salmon was deemed tasty, but the real star was the mash underneath. I enjoyed my chicken, which had plenty of skin and dark meat to keep me at bay, but I was so annoyed to be given about four haricot verts and one single baby carrot on the side. I understand we're in a recession, but a generous portion is appreciated. As most of you know, I'm a dessert enthusiast, and Mercer Kitchen has a variety of Asian-flecked American sweets. It was a toss up between a chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and an almond cake. Both my friend and I went with the latter, but we were annoyed when they were brought out over five minutes apart, with a look of contempt from our server. Was the almond cake good? Frankly it was the best part of the meal - I recommend you get it. It's warm and crispy on the outside with a soft interior that yields to the pressure of one's incisors. It's topped with sour cream ice cream and surrounded by sauteed pears. Excellent, but had I known, I would have picked up lunch from Dean and Deluca down the street first. After we paid, and expressed our thanks, our waiter didn't even crack a smile, or say anything for that matter. With someone as solemn as he, I'd assume his entire family died in a fire. We made our way up the stairs and out the door, relieved to breathe in the icy air.",1,0,2,Liz E.,"Flushing, NY",39,416,228

3,1/12/2009,"I'm not a fan of subterranean restaurants, but Jean-Georges manages to make this one a sensual experience. Diffused lighting sweeps across the dark cavernous points of the entire restaurant.  Diners only have to look up at the cast iron above them to be reminded that they are below the sidewalks of Soho.  Each small table is lit up by a single candlelight that manages to be romantic.  In the overall layout, there is a touch of provincial friendliness and charm as evidenced by the tables and benches for large groups, open kitchens, and exposed brick walls. The bar is definitely a seductive bastion for sipping on aperitifs and waiting.  It is, in fact, the best part of the establishment.  I recommend the chocolate martini which is simply delicious and alluring.However, let the cooing stop at the decor and bar.I was here on one autumn evening.  We had a 8pm reservation but had to wait.  We stopped by the bar, and 20 minutes later, we were seated at one of the small tables. I had the Carpaccio of black sea bass with lime, coriander, and mint and an entree of Sea Scallops that came with pea greens ravioli, smoked bacon vinaigrette.  My date had the Crisp Soft Shell Crab with beefsteak tomatoes, bibb lettuce, creamy avocado dressing and Breast And Confit Of Duck with local strawberries, pistachios, preserved lemon and wild rice.   We tried each other's dishes and agreed that mine was the better of the two.  He ended up leaving most of his dish uneaten, and I left mine partially untouched.  For some reason, we were still full, and ended up sharing Chocolate Cake dessert, which uplifted the otherwise rather disappointing dining experience. Jean-Georges surprised me with the lower than expected quality of food and cooking. The items were not as impressive as they sounded, and the presentation and decor did not have me fooled one bit.  JG has invested too much in ambiance and has not fulfilled the elite gastronomic oath.",1,1,1,Gera K.,"New York, NY",161,495,0
3,1/3/2009,"Came here for lunch with friends.  Course by course - For drinks we had the ginger margarita, cucumber martini, lemon vodka drink with thyme, and spiced apple cider with champagne. I loved the ginger margarita, it was delicious and had a strong ginger flavor. I sampled the other drinks, and they were light and refreshing.I had the crabcake appetizer and tuna and wasabi pizza. The crabcake was just mediocre, not nearly as heavenly as Lure's right across the street. Plus, you only get one crabcake for relatively the same price (whereas Lure gives you two heavenly cakes).  The pizza is original, but tastes like what you'd expect if you slapped some wasabi mayo and raw tuna on some store-bought pizza dough. This is just another spot in NYC and really not too special.  At the rate that Jean Georges is cranking em out nowadays, I guess that's to be expected.  The service was not on point - the waitstaff seemed was jittery and awkward, the execution of the dishes was not great.  One of my drinks came with a straw that was snipped in a haphazard way that made it pointy and dangerous to drink from (esp. if it was not your first drink of the meal! haha)  I appreciate the details, and they were simply not all there.",2,1,1,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",33,575,0

The candlelight dark setting is not quite intimate, but it is romantic in characteristic. I loved the exposed brick walls and white Christmas lighted arches on the ceiling which gives this spot a cloister feel. Based on what Zagat says, service is ""hit or miss"". We made our way to the downstairs dining room. We were greeted by the pretty hostess, then she pointed us in the direction of the coat check. While we wait to get seated 2 minutes after checking in our coats, she was oblivious to why we stood there in front of her.             We liked our server (never introduced himself by name) and we both agreed he performed his duty efficiently. He reminds me of an IT type, but we're not speculating anything. He did a great job serving us. For the appetizer, I had the crispy squid with lime spiked aioli (mayo). I liked the lime aioli, but the squid could have been more tender. It could easily pass for pub style calamari minus the marinara.My friend had the roasted beet & goat cheese salad. There were generous amounts of goat cheese, but the salad was overdressed with an overbearing balsamic preparation.    For the entree, I had the breast and confit of duck with a micro green salad of pomegranate and pistachios, preserved lemon and wild rice. I loved the creative combination of the salad. It was crunchy, semi-sweet, and well balanced. The duck was chewy, tender, and smoky in flavor but I felt the sauce was too intense.                               My friend had the Niman Ranch chili-glazed pork chop with creamy grits and braised red cabbage. The pork chop was fairly decent and a good portion size. It wasn't dried out and had a flavorful glaze over it. The side of grits was too starchy and tasted like flour. Neither of us were fans of the braised red cabbage. It tasted too much like sauerkraut from a Shea Stadium frankfurter.There was an unusual long wait at our table (30 minutes) after they took our last plates away. I guess there was no immediate party to take our place. The check was nowhere in sight, but they kindly kept refilling our water glasses.                         Overall, our dinner experience was good in spite of what the other reviewers say.

We had an awesome waitress, the music was pumpin', and the drinks were flowing.This time around the food was still good, and the restaurant was as beautiful as ever, but holy shit, was it depressing in there! We got a bad vibe from the start when we were waiting at the bar and overheard the manager chastising the bartender for some reason in a nasty, patronizing tone. When we were at our table, my brother commented on how sad everyone looked. There was a little cluster of waiters talking together in a corner of the restaurant, and the same manager from before stalked across the restaurant to shoo them away. They scattered like little puppies with their tails between their legs. Our waiter, who actually gave us great service, made us want to cry! Dude was a machine, like cranking out orders left and right, but he looked so worn out and just had this blank look on his face. We couldn't figure out why he was so gloomy, but later in the evening we heard a little crash and turned to see the same manager, literally speed-walking in his suit across the restaurant towards our waiter, who had apparently dropped something, and began audibly scolding him. It turned into somewhat of a fight, and it was just unpleasant to witness. Later in the evening, the manager stopped by our table to ask how everything was, and adopted the phoniest smile I've ever seen. It was so fucking creepy, we decided to skip dessert.

2,9/21/2008,"Another overrated trendy restaurant (yawn).Appetizers were by far the better part of the evening- tuna was pretty good, sea bass carpaccio was really good. Calamari, though, were dry and tasteless. Entrees were majorly disappointing. Duck medallions were dry, overcooked, paired with undercooked wild rice and wild strawberries (while in themselves good, they didn't go with the dish). Scallops had to be sent back, they were tough and really overcooked. I don't remember the last time I had to send back scallops, that's cooking 101!! Skate with rice was nice, had nice flavors but the quantity was  ridiculous and rice dry (with  pretty ugly presentation). Overall, in almost everything, I felt a lack of skill and care that was way too obvious and for $30 a plate it's unforgivable.",0,0,0,Dina L.,"New York, NY",93,87,3

We were seated / crunched around a circle table (made for 2, not 3) this made for some uncomfortableness. Service was friendly and attentive.The food...we had the beet salad and soft shell crab to start. Loved the beet / goat cheese salad. For my main, I had the skate...and Loved it. The other 2 had salmon and scallops...which they both enjoyed. The portions weren't huge (I'm a mid west girl :) but they were appropriate.We enjoyed a nice bottle of wine, CA Sauvignon Blanc and good coffee.It was enjoyable, I'm sure I will be back...because the location fits so perfectly.

4,6/26/2008,"As the end of the budget cycle approaches and I wrap up a few final weeks at my current job, I have the boon to be the recipient of several ""going away lunches"" on the company card. Because if you don't use it, you lose it.  Most recently, this took the form of a long lunch at Mercer Kitchen.I've had drinks here before, but always felt like I wasn't classy enough; lunch was equally pretentious. We started with the soft shell crab with tomato and avocado, and Jesus was it amazing. I had the black truffle and fontina pizza, which kind of relied to heavily on the celebrity of the truffles but was still great.  Dessert was warm chocolate cake* with toffee ice cream, and I totally ate all of it even though I was feeling sick.Overall I give it four stars.Also of note:my full cup of coffee was served with skim milk.  Now I know all the models come in there demanding watered-down milk substitutes, so if that's how you're going to roll, just fill the cup halfway. Because a tablespoon of skim milk accomplishes nothing for anyone.Due to Mercer's locational endowment (below the sidewalk of Prince St.) it also is the beneficiary of some serious leaks on the lower floor.  Their brilliant solution? To hang umbrellas from the ceiling and line them with black garbage bags. In some permutations of the universe this could be endearing, but the one over my table was for ""Rush Hour 3"".  Not so much.*Can we please come to some understanding regarding the molten vs. warm chocolate cake conundrum?  Molten always means a delicious, melty delight, but ""warm"" can go either way. It's a bi-sexual of the confectionery world. Sometimes it's an orgy of melted chocolate and sometimes it's just cake.  I'm sick of being burned on this one.",2,3,4,Mr. Robert Dobalina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,113,23
5,5/27/2008,"so from the outside, this restaurant is pretty unassuming. in fact, we walked past the corner restaurant 3 times before we realized that this was in fact the place. but once you walk inside and head downstairs, you realize that you are definitely in a jean-georges restaurant (aka spice market). the place is dimly lit with brick walls and soft gray leather booths and practically is the definition of SoHo. you immediately feel sexy as you walk to your table and you a order a cucumber martini with hendricks gin. and this is where your mercer kitchen experience becomes amazing. each dish is prepared with maximal visual and savory perfection. the wasabi crusted salmon (prepared medium rare) tastes how every salmon dish should taste and the skate with sushi rice and asparagus is a one of a kind dish--like eating a piece of sushi in all of its delicious different parts (which is how i wish i could eat sushi anyways). you finish your meal and you want a refreshing dessert? try the warm chocolate cake and toffee ice cream--the chocolate cake is filled with chocolate hot fudge that oozes out onto your ice cream. what more could you ask for? how about a great waitress and a very reasonable bill. in the end, mercer kitchen has it all--great ambience, waitstaff, food, and price. highly recommended if you want a good NYC experience.",1,0,2,Alisa A.,"San Francisco, CA",87,42,0

The famous sandwich has chicken, avocado, bacon, lettuce and a delicious herb mayo. Come to think of it, in my world, bacon on anything is good...My boyfriend came with me for the first time when we were shopping in Soho and kind of brought me back down to earth. Maybe it's not the best sandwich I've ever had but it sure is delicious. And honestly, sometimes I crave it. I've only been to Mercer Kitchen for lunch. Every time I've gotten this sandwich. I have gotten other things and split them with friends. The pizza is great. The fries are thin and crispy. Mercer Kitchen is a great place when you're shopping in Soho for a bite for lunch.

3,2/8/2008,"I'd been to Mercer Kitchen in the past, but it was ages ago. I remember the food being good, but not great. So I wasn't too excited to spend more of my hard-earned money there again, when I know there are so many other amazing restaurants in the city, but my out of town visitors had heard wonderful things from another foodie friend, so off we went.We had a 8pm res and were seated right away. The restaurant was quite busy, but I guess most places are on Thursdays. Each couple (2 total) chose to share a couple of apps and an entree. My SO and I chose the roasted beets with goat cheese salad and the steamed shrimp salad as our apps. I love roasted beets, but he doesn't, so I ate most of this dish. The goat cheese was a little mild for my tastes, but the beets were delicious. The shrimp salad was really good, nice tender, moist shrimp with a tangy dressing. A tad overdressed, but tasty. The other couple started with the butternut squash soup, which was poured tableside (always a dramatic presentation!), and the tuna roll. They both seemed to love the soup, and the tuna roll looked nice.For entrees, we shared the lobster, which for the price, was way too small. I would not do this again, even though it was well cooked, and served with arthichoke hearts and fingerling potatoes. Yummy, but not at all worth the money. The other couple shared the salmon, which looked great, and they both really enjoyed it.For dessert, we were pretty full, but the popcorn float was intriguing, so we ordered it. We all imagined that the popcorn would be INSIDE the float somehow, but no, it's in a little cup on the side of an ice cream and caramel float. Tasty, but misleading, no?Service was all over the place, and not in a good way. We had no fewer than 3 waiters (or bussers) buzzing around our table most of the evening. This made it feel like we were being stalked. One of them removed a cocktail before it was completely finished, without even asking. That's not cool. And in the end, when we were done with our dessert, no one asked if we wanted anything else for a really long time, so we had to flag someone down for our check. This took another 10+ minutes! So after stalking us for our entire meal, when it came time to close us out, they suddenly all disappeared. So back to my original assessment, food at Mercer Kitchen is good, not great, but for the money, not really worth it. The interior is nice, really cool and dark, lovely decor.

2,1/26/2008,"The Mercer Kitchen is a great example of an establishment that emphasizes style over substance. In short, the space is pretty, the people are pretty, but nothing else is worthwhile.A large group of us had dinner last night. Friend and I both ordered the steak and frites; figured it was a safe choice.  Shared appetizer was the crunchy squid with spicy mayo.The squid was undercooked, and had a gamy texture and flavor. It made one of us ill into the following morning, and neither of us could eat more than a couple of pieces. Another friend, however, had no problem scarfing up the remains. The mayo that came with was simply vile, perhaps rancid.The steak had the taste, appearance and texture of a super-market strip that had been hastily pan-fried, stacked on a gelatinous goo of ambiguous sauce, and then covered with bargain shitake mushrooms. The frites could have passed for oven-baked frozen fries.A cookie plate for dessert was a nice surprise, with all of the freshly baked cookies and madelines being quite tasty. They would have been even more enjoyable had our coffee not shown up nearly a half hour after dessert arrived.The space was severely overheated, making the attractive settings much less comfortable than they could have been. Anything more than a T-shirt was overdressed for downstairs.Service was just OK, although things were often forgotten - too often, even for a large group. The heat was obviously too much for the waiter; he had suffered a deodorant meltdown, and reeked of BO. To be fair, I have a sensitive sense of smell, and no one else seemed to pick up on the noisome server.I found the clientele to be somewhat obnoxious (jumping the line for the coat check - classy - and a fur-clad step-monster cursing out her hubby's crotchfruit. Lovely!) This is not the fault of the restaurant aside from being a honeypot to attract such vulgarians.If you're looking to see and be seen by the superficials of the world, it isn't a bad place.

It is still juicy and it flakes off perfectly. The vegetables on top, including -- yum -- fennel! The base was mashed potatoes surrounded by a ring of ""gravy.""

Molten chocolate oozes out of the chocolate cake as we cut into it... how amazingly delicious. The cheesecake was a little plain after the chocolate, but it was still tasty. Especially the graham cracker crust. The best part of the cheesecake was the concord grape sorbet. OMG... I am drooling a little bit just thinking about it. The rest of the platters were so-so. The cheesecake plate had very sour cranberries, but the blood orange was quite good. The chocolate cake plate had an ice cream that I didn't care for and a cookie that slightly tasted of banana? I'm not quite sure.1:30pm: Finish up dessert, request the check.... and we are up and going.Overall an interesting experience. I don't know if I would be back.

Service...OK -- considering we were a large group I think they should have communicated better with us.Dessert -- OK.I think it would be a great lunch spot but I'd go elsewhere in that neighborhood for dinner.,1,0,1,Kimberli M.,"New York, NY",124,423,156
2,12/2/2007,"The people handling the phones were nice; I'll give them that. The lower level dining room is nice; I'll give them that. BUT, the service and quality of food was subpar, with glimpses of adequacy. And, frankly, I don't care about the ""oh, I went there for lunch as opposed to dinner, so my expectations are lower."" Bullsheeeee-t! I expect the same calibre of service at every setting, and at those prices, it's what we all deserve. The bright spot: the proscuitto and cheese appetizer. I didn't order it, so I have no details to share. Just that it was fine. The server showed up a few times and asked my gentleman companions if they wanted drink refills. He never approached me, and clearly, my white chocolate martini was swallowed up in one fell swoop. Nice. Luckily, I was a guest, so I didn't have to feel gypped. The only way I would entertain the thought of a return visit would be if I was only visiting the bartender.",1,0,1,Marja M.,"Alameda, CA",42,189,258
2,11/11/2007,"Maybe it was the Marc Jacbos sighting in the lobby or the classically california style menu, but when I finally walked into Mercer kitchen Ii was expecting a lot.  Before I can comment on the food, it must be noted that the room was gorgeous.  Long counters with high stools, sort of like a communal table but with a little more sophistication.  The counters lead to a large, pristine, white tiled, open kitchen.  The room was annoyingly loud, but whatever I was willing to put that aside because I was looking forward to what I thought was going to be an amazing meal.  The menu was not adventurous, but full of delicious sounding classics.  For an appetizer, the fried squid with chili mayonnaise was a perfect combination of hot and cold and crunchy and smooth.  My friends butternut squash soup with black trumpets oddly tasted a little too much like chicken broth.  My entree was a melt in your mouth piece of salmon with what was advertised as brussels sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes.  The salmon was perfect, with just the right amount of salt and pepper on the top, very simple but with such a good piece of salmon that was sufficient.  But the brussels sprouts were almost blanched, stripped of flavor and the mashed potatoes had not a hint of truffle.  So the entree was basically a dissapointment.  The best part of the dinner, the most memorable moment of the evening, had to be when a cockroach crawled across the table in front of me.  I could further explain about the bizarre french waiter, the dessert....But I think the last memory says enough on its own.

3,6/3/2007,"The moment I opened the tall glass door, I was greeted with a friendly smile by a very fashionable Asian hostess.  Since it was just the start of lunch, there was an immediate table available without wait.  The restaurant had two levels, the top which is very small surrounded a central staircase leading down to a very large and much dimmer dining area downstairs.  I dined on the top level, which was well illuminated by the sunlight.  The setting was very trendy cool, with a minimalist dcor accentuated by servers adorned in black outfits.  Very New York chic.    The tasting menu composed of three portions: appetizers, entre, and dessert.  For my appetizer, I opted for the Skate Carpaccio served with a Blood Orange and Shaved Fennel Salad.  Very fine slices of skate lined the plate, drizzled with olive oil and citrus, and centered with a pile of fennel shavings, the design was visually stimulating.  Fortunately, the taste was equally delicious.  The skate was moist and sweet.  The only refinement I would call for would be for the fennel salad to be properly dressed.  The fish was done well but the salad was left plain.  Fortunately, there was enough oil on the plate to lightly dress the salad manually, so in the end, it tasted very good.  For my entre, I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese served with Prosciutto and Truffles. Call me a Gringa, but yes, I'm a sucker for Mac and Cheese.  And boy, the way it was done at Mercer only reaffirms my love for it.  This is one of the best I've ever had.  Served in a little cast iron dish, the Mac was piping hot and bubbling with creamy goodness.  The pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce was creamy but not heavy, the prosciutto was salty and chewy, and the truffle was soft and aromatic...Served with a side of lightly dressed greens, this was the perfect lunch to have.   Needless to say, I was very pleased.  For dessert, I had the Banana Fritters served with Vanilla Malt Ice Cream.  The banana pieces were coated in panko and sesame, deep fried to a deep golden brown and topped with an oval scoop of ice cream.  The bananas could've been fried for just a minute less but otherwise, a lovely dessert.  That ice cream is really to die for.

The portions were very well done. I had the Eggs Benedict and French Toast.  My friends had the Chicken Sandwich and the free range chicken.  The negatives on the meal, I heard from my friends was that the sandwich bread was too dry.  However, I would not describe her of discerning taste.  So I did not factor it into my rating.I also disagree to some degree on whether this is a good place for the kids.  When I was for Sunday Brunch, I saw many children there.  Are there kid friendly distractions like colouring books, and what not? No.  By the same token, it is not an adult only environment where you should be on alert when eating with the family.I am rating this place 4 stars, based on my Brunch experience.

We stood there for about 5 minutes, unsure of what to do, and getting in the way of all the waiters trying to do their job. I finally got exasperated and went to the front and asked them, "" What's going on?"". The same hostess snapped at me and said ""I told you to wait there. They're setting up your table!"" I mean, the girl was RUDE, and we didn't even do anything to her. We sat there and waited patiently for 20 minutes, and didn't complain! I said to the man laughing next to me who had seen the whole thing, ""No, that's alright, you don't need to apologize. You just left us there."" For a restaurant with such great reviews, they weren't very courteous. I'm not that hard to please, but this woman was just a plain bitch. They ended up seating us at some other table anyway (which is so weird). And I think the manager heard about the whole scuffle and came over and gave us free appetizers, which was very nice, and apologized ""for the wait"".

4,3/12/2007,"Mercer Kitchen is a very interesting restaurant. On the outside it looks like its just a restaurant located in the Mercer Hotel. You walk in the entrance to the restaurant from street level and it looks like a higher-end restaurant.  The tables on the street level are for those folks who've made reservations already. For everyone else, go downstairs and take a number. Just hope that you don't go to ""Siberia"". Once you get downstairs, its literally day and night. The lowerlevel is dimly lit and has some interesting interior decorations of a modern design blended with the exposed brick walls.I understand this place is a French fusion restaurant by Jean-George. The friday night that I ate there, all of the tables surrounding me were all French. The service is moderate, could be better. I had to wait 10 minutes just to find out waiter to get the check. I tried to get other waiters to get my bill, yet to no avail. I kind of feel sorry for all of the Mexican servicemen working there who only change out plates and pour you water, while the Anglo waiters cash all the tips. I know that this procedure is common with all of the high-end restaurants in Manhattan. But it gets kind of ridiculous when the Mexican servicement gives you better service than your actual waiter, yet they get none or bare minimals of the tip that you leave them.The food is hit or miss. I had the Bay Scallops and they were too small. The crabcake was pretty good with its vinigrette sauce. I had the Green Apple Vacherin desert (apple thyme cider with lemon puree).

When you first walk in, no one is there to greet you and not having been there would not know automatically to go down a dark staircase to find the hostess.  Once we figured out where to go and let the hostess know we were there, we headed to the bar. The bar is cool, but fits about 2 people. Downstairs is another bar, but it was very crowded, so we ordered a drink upstairs and noticed that there is a lounge attached to the bar. We asked if we could hang out there while waiting for our reservation, but learned that it is for hotel guests only.  We decided to head downstairs anyway, because there were more people but also more space. Both bars are situated in high traffic areas where the servers have to fly past you every second. The other option is to sit on top of diners.  Overall, though, downstairs is pretty cool. The tables are all wood, the walls and floors are brick and the lights are pretty dim. It was very comfortable with acoustic covers playing. (imagine acoustic queen - we will rock you) The kitchen is fully open into the dining area, so you can see everything that is going on.  About 10 minutes after our reservations and 40 minutes after we arrived, we checked again on our table. The hostess said that the table we were waiting for was having dessert and would be finished soon. While that was happening, several other tables came and went. Finally, our table was ready.The menu was pretty good, basic american type food, although they call it american french fusion. I read some yelp reviews a head of time and knew to get the french fries and the bartender upstairs told Mr. JT that the pork chops, tuna spring roll, and crab cake are awesome. We asked the waiter if the french fries were cooked in peanut oil (as to not kill our friend Mr. F). The waiter looked at us for no less than 10 seconds, then slowly turned his head from side to side. I said, ""are you certain? he can die if he eats peanut oil."" The waiter chuckled slowly and said that he was sure. He did not make us overwhelmingly confident.  So, I got the tuna spring roll as an appetizer and a mozzarella, tomato, and basil pizza. Mr. JT got the pork chops and Mr. F got the NY strip. While waiting for the food we were served a crusty stone oven cooked roll with some olive oil. Mr. JT tasted something spicy in the olive oil, but for me, I just tasted pretty bland oil.Then we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. During this time a table of four beside us finished up their meals, the table was cleared, and another party of 4 was seated and received their appetizers. We then received ours. The tuna spring roll was fresh, raw tuna wrapped in spinach, then in a spring roll wrapper. It was pretty awesome. I was expecting cooked tuna, but was pleasantly surprised with a more sushi-like approach.  We also got a shrimp cocktail for the table. The shrimp were fantastic, very fresh and large. They were served with a very good cocktail sauce, a tartar sauce and a soy sauce.Next we waited again and again and again. The table beside us received extra drinks, more food, and then entrees. We still couldn't even get our waiters attention to get us additional drinks. Finally Mr. JT got him to bring a beer and asked about our dinners. He told us that the food should be out ""soon"". After a while longer, our entrees arrived.My pizza was fantastic. The crust was thin, but not too crunchy or too soft, the tomato sauce was really fresh, the cheese was fresh, and fresh basil was shredded on top. It was the perfect size for one person. Mr JT's pork chops came on top of a marinated cabbage salad and a side of mac & cheese. He thought the entire entree was delicious, the mac & cheese was fancy cheese and sort of mushed non-elbow noodles. Mr. F got the strip steak which came with a side of fries. We tried the fries first to confirm they were safe. (they were) The fries were decent, but because of our delicious fries the night before (at CraftSteak) they tasted pretty mediocre.At this point, we had been at the restaurant for over 2 hours and it felt like an eternity, so we decided to leave without dessert. This effort took at least another 15 minutes to flag down the waiter and get the check. Keep in mind, he was not terribly busy, he was just standing around chatting with other servers and generally not doing anything. Needless to say, he didn't earn a very good tip.I think the atmosphere would really make it a nice place to eat and hang out, but I just can't look past the service.

Regardless the atmosphere was never pleasant and that was before it started raining... inside.The food is excellent. Though there isn't a french influence to be found {unless you count french fries} despite the press. The menu is nouveux American with a heavy Asian influence.The oysters are some of the best I've had, but the sauces served with them were strong enough to kill off your taste buds for the night . The Sea Bass carpaccio was also great but inexplicably drenched in lime juice giving it an almost cervieche character. I then had the chili and soy rubbed pork while my companion had the soy infused steak both of which came cooked within an inch of their lives. I was just debating about sending it back when the roof started leaking. After several sodden minuites we were moved only to find we were under another leak, so we moved again. {The couple next to us had been moved five times} At this point I didn't give a damn about the meal, I just wanted to drink.

3,8/8/2006,"Decided to try this place b/c I've always passed it and thought it looked pretty intimate.  Dinner is served downstairs.  There's an open kitchen where you can see all the chefs/sous working on our dishes.  We got a table near the bar, so it was not as intimate and quiet as I had hoped for a dining room.  Bar patrons were standing around the vicinity.  With my bellini, I shared 2 appetizers w/ my dinner guest.  Portions are not too bad, considering the avg appetizer price was $10-$15.  We shared a Tuna Spring Roll (Raw Tuna wrapped in a ""phyllo dough"" for a light crispy texture w/ a cilantro gingery sauce) & a Black Sea Bass Carpaccio, which had a clean, refreshing taste.  Both were very delightful so I was excited for my entree to arrive.  I ordered a cod potatoe cake w/ fennel.  I was a little disappointed, b/c my mouth did not have a party!!  Then checked out the dessert menu and nothing really caught my eye but decided to give it one more try and shared a strawberry ice cream sandwich.  Turned out pretty good, it wasn't too sweet.  A terrine display w/ strawberry ice cream in btwn a cookie w/ pistachio crunch surrounded w/ a strawberry lychee soup.  Very yummy!!  Overall, the service was ok.  Drinks were a tad $$$.  My dinner guest had a chopin martini for $14, which I think is a lil too pricey, even though I understand it comes w/ the service and the sitting down atmosphere vs a bar.  Definitely won't return for dinner, maybe for a lunch or brunch.",2,0,0,D D.,"New York, NY",3,40,2
4,5/29/2006,A good place for lunch or just to rest those feet after a long day of walking and shopping in Soho. The margherita pizza and beet salad were very good.,0,0,1,Helen Y.,"Pacific Heights, San Francisco, CA",621,1008,1735
4,5/10/2006,"I have never been disappointed with the Mercer Kitchen.  Business lunch or dinner, meeting an old friend to catch up, re-energizing after a long day of shopping, this subterranean space is perfect for most any occasion.  The $20, three course prix-fixe lunch is one of the best deals in town.  Plus, this is one of the few places that does panna cotta perfectly. Bathrooms are also worth checking out; the ceilings have those little clouded-glass circles, so you can make out the shadows of the pedestrians on the sidewalk above.",5,3,4,P K.,"San Francisco, CA",210,126,18

4,9/19/2005,"My aunt, a New Yorker of 15 years, chose this restaurant to be my first eating-out experience in New York, and with good reasoning.   Think chic and hip.  Eat a late lunch on the undergroud level and watch Soho-folk walk on the sidewalk above your head.  Situated amongst the hipe of artsy street venders and beautiful people, Mercer Kitchen offers you both great food and location.  I would go back just to hang out in the bathroom.  See for yourself.",0,0,0,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",41,280,505
5,7/15/2005,"My familiarity with zen-like bathroom of the Mercer is strong, since I had to escape there during dinner with Sotheby's furniture expert. Somehow, he was taller when appraising my antiques than when taking me to dinner. Maybe because of all that crawling under 18th century table. It was sexier in apartment than in restaurant. Also, he has strange bicycle chain permanently attached around wrist. I wanted to cut it off with big steak knife. Food far surpassed conversation, and bathroom was a welcome refuge, with very zen-like sink faucets and little river stones for meditation. Repeat to self: ""even though I am afraid i will fall asleep face down in soup if i have to listen to more crackle-finish chair history, I completely love and respect myself..."" yes, in date-crises, even Natashka can be new-age. I didn't think it could happen either, but I promise that the river stones would have the same effect on you. mercerhotel.com/kitchen.…",1,9,4,natashka o.,"San Francisco, CA",70,58,24
