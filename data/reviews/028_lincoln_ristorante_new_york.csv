4.0,4/13/2019,"Had dinner here pre-theater on March 30, a Saturday.  The restaurant offered a pre-fixe pre-theater menu, although we we heard additional dishes being offered to the table next to us and when we inquired, we found out that other items were possible too.We started with a fois gras terrine that was substituted off the regular menu and a mozzarella appetizer.  I had the gargnanelli entree and my friend had the steak.  We ordered a side order of mushrooms, which was large and delicious.  My garganelli was really really good -- but by the time it came I had had too much of the pate and also the delicious bread that was served for the table (separate than what came with the pate).  So I couldn't do justice to the garganelli and ended up taking half of it home.  (I gleefully had it for breakfast the next morning.  Yum.)  My friend's steak looked very good and in spite of herself, she finished it (as opposed to taking leftovers home for her pooch).  My friend had the chocolate tortino for dessert which looked and tasted delicious.  I had the berry plate, which was perfectly fine but couldn't compare to the tortino.  Wheelchair accessibility notes:  Unchanged from last review.",0,0,0,Meg S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,137,0
3.0,4/8/2019,We have always had a nice time at Lincoln usually pre Lincoln Center theatre. The service is nice. The food is good. The tables are not too close together. But today I looked up the enjoyable half bottle of Chianti Classico that we enjoyed last night and now I have to admit that marking up the price almost five times is not right. I am sorry but I can't go back. I feel like I have been deceived. There is no justification for that pricing.,0,0,0,alan b.,"Bronxville, NY",1,36,20
3.0,4/6/2019,"It's such a treat to have a nice restaurant right at Lincoln Center, what more can you ask for in terms of location right before or after an event? The space and architecture are completely unique and quite special. One shortcoming is that you must order from a scaled down, prix fixe menu between 5-7pm (every day), though this is not atypical for restaurants in the area for pre-theater. We enjoyed our time at Lincoln, between the nice ambiance, excellent cocktails and wines, and generally solid, though neither flawless nor exciting food. At this price point, there are other options in the neighborhood that deliver more interesting flavors and better execution. Nonetheless, having such good bones, with a little more refinement, Lincoln could really shine. Atmosphere-Amazing modern architecture, really creates a unique space with vistas to Lincoln Center.-Upscale, but not stuffy or overly formal. It's easy to have a relaxed meal here.- Smart casual, though some patrons are more dressed up for events at Lincoln Center.FoodBetween 5-7pm, one must select from a scaled down 2- or 3-course prix fixe menu ($66-78). Overall, the food was of decent quality, though there were some missteps in execution. That being said, the flavor profiles were generally quite nice, and most of the dishes were good, just unexceptional.  We had: - Polpo alla Griglia (Pan Seared Octopus, Braised Tomato Ragu, Caramelized Onions, Prosciutto Vinaigrette): Quite tender, with nice char/caramelization. Well executed.- Garganelli Verdi con Bolognese di Anatra (Spinach Pasta, Duck Bolognese, Pecorino Ginepro): Excellent - ragu had rich, deep flavors and though the pasta was a touch thick it was tender. Recommend!- Salmone (Roasted King Salmon, Baby Turnip, Red Wine Braised Onion Ragu, Soubise Toasted Brussels Sprouts): Nice, if unexciting, flavor profile. However, came out over cooked.- Manzo Arrosto (Roasted Striploin of Beef, Red Wine Shallot Puree, Potato-Celery Root Gratin, Puntarelle, Barolo Sauce): Moist and tender, perfectly cooked - but again, the flavors on this main were basic. Recommend.- Tortino di Cioccolato (Chocolate Brown Butter Genovese, Dark Chocolate Salted Ganache, Praline Croccante, Hazelnut Gelato): Decadent and rich, but very good. The salt makes a big difference in terms of balance, wish there was a tad more of it. Recommend.-Torta di Mele (Caramelized Apples, Pistachio Dacquoise Bomboloni, Farro Gelato): Rather bland, having flavor almost akin to applesauce. Sounded better in concept.BeverageLike the drinks selection here. We began with a round of cocktails; the list is interesting with plenty of light and dark selections. The Rosato Sbagliato (Aperol, Cynar, Cocchi Rosa Solerno Blood Orange Liquore, Prosecco - $18) and Fuochetto L'Orsetto (Azteca Azul Tequila, Rabarbaro Amaro, Sfumato, Lime Juice, Gingered Sea Salt - $19) were both very enjoyable. Elected to have wines by the glass with our mains. The list has quite a few options (9 selections each of red/white), most ranging from $17-20, which is awesome. We liked both the 2016 Luigi Giordano 'Buschet' Barbera d'Alba ($18) and Cima di Conegliano Prosecco ($16). The bottle list is naturally Italian focused, and offers a number of options $150 and below across key Italian regions. Solid selection.Service-Attentive and generally professional, especially the somm.-Seem to be pretty accustomed to dealing with time constraints before shows, though we left plenty of time before ours.",0,0,0,D.

2.0,4/5/2019,We've dined at Lincoln many times but last Monday April 1 we were very disappointed.  The food was not up to what we've enjoyed in the past both in preparation and presentation.  For an appetizer I had the Insalata di Scarola.  Even though the ingredients sounded intriguing nothing stood out and the dressing had a sour somewhat harsh flavor.  My husband and I both had pasta for our main courses.  I had the Orchiette which I found to be fairly flavorless and greasy -- not something I felt was worth $36.   My husband had the Tortellini di Vitella.  The pasta was very underdone and the filling was tough and certainly not succulent.  Again we felt it was way overpriced at $38.  Our table ordered the special dessert which was fresh berries with lemon sorbet.  The berries were nothing special and did not taste that fresh.  The sorbet was almost invisible it was so small.  The ambience was as lovely as ever and the service was good.  But given the quality of the food we would definitely think twice before going back.,0,0,0,Terri M.,"Stonington, CT",0,2,0

Absolutely to die for Wait staff brought over the tastiest focaccia bread... peppery and warm with roasted onions on top along with a side of ricotta mixed with honey.

They confirmed that they'll prepare it and make it a surprise, but they forgot about it on the day...Throughout the meal, we had at least 5 different servers serve our table (even tho it wasn't busy), which was very confusing/overwhelming and caused miscommunications of our orders.Lastly, I wanted to use my OpenTable reward points there. The manager said the system was not working, and took about 20mins to process it and charged us 7 times by mistake (cancelled the other 6 in the end).Overall, I was hoping for a smooth experience on a special occasion but left disappointed.

5.0,12/23/2018,"A Holiday Night to RememberI suspect an error occurred when I was able to purchase tickets online to their Feast of Seven Fishes at 6 pm just two days in advance. Since this 5-course meal usually requires at least 2 hours, they do not offer it as a pre-theater option, but I guess a glitch permitted me to purchase this time slot. When a reservationist informed me that they had no booking for me, she referred me to manager Peter Kane, who with manager Vojislav Knezevic arranged to accommodate my online order.I was gratefully astonished that they bore the inconvenience of serving me and my guest a 5-course dinner at an earlier hour than usual and within only 90 minutes! The bread, oysters, due crudo, and spaghetti alla chitarra with calamari offered a spectrum of tasty flavors and textures. The dover sole and sfogliatella were a bit overcooked, but they did not spoil the meal overall.The flavorful food, beautiful views, and exceptional service which allowed us to make our 8 pm curtain on time made it a night to remember.

5.0,12/6/2018,"I'll say up front that I'm reviewing my superb experience at the bar here, not a meal in the dining room. The occasion: A friend in town from LA who procures real estate for a national fast casual chain. When he comes to NY, he enjoys a more elevated experience in the food and bev world, and I'm always happy to oblige him with suggestions.After lunch elsewhere on the Upper West Side, I said I wanted an amaro for dessert. I recommended we go to Lincoln. We grabbed a couple stools at the small but well-appointed bar. Truthfully, this review is more about our bartender, Gaston. We chatted a bit about amari, and before we knew it, he was guiding us on a broad tour of the many fine amari the bar stocks. Gaston has that rare trait in people who know a lot but share their knowledge so generously and congenially that the experience becomes a true pleasure, which alone earns him five stars.Inspired by the amazing flavors we sampled, we each ordered a Negroni. True, the menu has a matrix from which you can mix and match the basic liquors. But by this point, we were more interested in a custom cocktail by Gaston. And we were not disappointed. Mine was the best Negroni I've ever had. More were ordered : ) This is the longest review I've ever left for a cocktail. But the experience was so much more than one delicious drink. Gaston's knowledge and service epitomize the best in hospitality. I just hope he remembers how he made my Negroni when I soon return!",0,0,0,George F.,"New York, NY",1,17,3

Very nice focaccia to start as well as an amuse bouche. Excellent pasta dishes.  For example a lovely Pasta e Fagioli, Braised Guanciale, Beans, Parmigiano Croutons, Tomato-Pork Passata.

For dessert, my favorite is the Foresta Nera, Dark Chocolate Mousse, Cocoa-Nib Brownie, Poached Raspberries, Cannoli-Raspberry Variegato.  What I especially like is the dark chocolate mousse is very thick and has an excellent consistency if you really like dark chocolate.

2.0,10/6/2018,"So this is first time lunch only observation - maybe something magic happens later but sorry to report this place sucks. Beautiful room, nice bar and with cool negroni selection where you can choose from the spirits, bitters and vermouths. Wine by glass seemed very mediocre however. They offer a $34 prix fixe lunch which is really a ripoff in itself as it's  only a starter and a pasta.  Main courses are not included. My starter was a fig and prosciutto salad. One tiny sized underripe fig cut in half with some banal prosciutto and greens. Tiny, not bad but forgettable. Why bother with the unripe fig too? The complimentary foccacia however was excellent along with the ricotta whipped spread. The pasta was a spaghetti a al Chittara with mixed seafood. The pasta was nice - seemed homemade but undercooked - not al dente but undercooked. But the sin here which really pisses me off is the the seafood and the so called sauce.  The seafood was chopped so fine into Itsy bitsy pieces I had to call the Medical Examiners office to tell me which molecule was shrimp, or squid or octopus.  This to me is right out of Paula Deens son textbook. Like they hired a passing tourist from Cleveland who couldn't pay the bill to mise en place the seafood.  But the sauce was grounds for immediate revulsion.  It took a few minutes but then it dawned on me - this was from an industrial sized can of Spaghetti Os which I hadn't had since I stayed at my Irish neighbors house in Queens when my mother was away.  Insipid, gray-orange slop. I don't care if dinner service is prepared by Mary Magdalen and her four angel sisters - lunch must have been prepared by Donald Trump Jr after a nasty out chugging beer with Judge Kavanaugh.

1.0,4/11/2018,"So sad to say that this restaurant is not worth the price by any stretch. Pre-theatre, you can only do price pix at their tables, and my entire party was not eating. They said they serve an al la carte menu at the bar, so I sat at some small tables at a banquette in the bar area for my party of 4. I was then told that I could not eat there; even though the hostesses pointed me directly to the spots and said you can order al la carte here. No. The house policy is that you can only have food at the physical bar, which is about 2 feet away from the small tables. When I finally got a seat at the bar, and left my party so I could eat something, I found out there was little I could eat. And nothing was adaptable. I have food allergies to gluten, dairy, and pork, and there were literally 3 things on the menu that I could eat, when the dairy or pork was removed. They were not even unwilling to put a piece of chicken or fish on top of their salad for me. The scallops I ended up with were $26 and there were literally 2 scallops on a plate with some sauce that was cold, and not joking, 3 pieces of greens. For my 2 glasses of prosecco and literally 2 scallops, plus tip, the bill was $86. And I have to mention that the scallops were flavorless, seared on only 1 side, and had sand in them.

It was all very tasty, salty, and clearly of high quality, so we got hungrier. The cheese plate we decided on was solid. A great variety of (4) local and well-known cheeses, fancy date bread, and a few other compliments for $21.  I'd like to skip the drawn out presentation our bartender gave as he served, though.

I had the spinach pasta with duck bolognese, my dad the short ribs, my sister the branzino, and my mom the salmon. The pasta and short rib were the stars. The fish dishes were extremely fresh, but lacked a bit of flavor. But, neither dish really was supposed to be much more than the fish itself, so no worries there. After we ordered earlier on, we were given two on-the-house goodies. First they brought some delicious bread with a whipped ricotta/honey dip. Impeccable.

Have the feedback to the hostess who barely looked up, seemed more involved in whatever else she was doing (not actually with customers) than listening.

Rich flavors, tasty and prepared with attention to detail. The only dish I wasn't really a fan of was the meatballs.  Wine was ok. Love the amuse bouche they bring and a little something sweet at the end. Service at the bar on one visit was good, while service at a table on my next visit was a bit uppity. Experienced it at the hostess stand as well. Snootiness is never an endearing quality if you want your customers to return. Did not appreciate the waiter asking me ""that's it?"" after placing our order of two dishes and a glass of wine at 10:30 pm - how big of a meal do you expect me to eat that late at night?

After date night at Jazz at Lincoln Center in Time Warner we had arranged a reservation at the Lincoln. My boyfriend liked that spot and was excited for me to try something new. We arrived at 9:20p for our 9:30p reservation. The restaurant was not even half full yet they attempted to seat us at what anyone would have considered the worst available table. We asked for a different table, preferably banquette seating, and they obliged. We waited for 10 minutes with no one approaching the table. When what appeared to be the floor manager walked by checking tables, her glaze skimmed past our table. We got her attention and asked for water, menus and some wine. She said our waiter would be over. My boyfriend saw her approach him and he nodded, but did not come. A steward came by to get our water preference and we received water and menus. After sitting there 20 minutes without even ordering wine, we got up and left.At this point the waiter came over to ask me if everything was ok. The hostess got the manager and everyone seemed concerned after 20 minutes of no care at all that we were leaving. Again, the restaurant was under half empty, it was late and most people were well into their meals. This was not a situation where we just needed to be patient. We honestly thought we might be on candid camera. We went across the street - choosing among one of many favorite spots on that strip. We were quickly seated in a bustling restaurant with no reservation at a perfect table and had water and wine at our table within 3 minutes of being seated.

5.0,11/12/2017,"It is so easy for restaurants at or very near opera/theater venues to under-perform: offering convenience, rather than quality, as a priority. However, this does not apply to Lincoln Ristorante. We flew up from DC to celebrate my partner's 53rd birthday to see Turandot at The Met right next door.Firstly, it is a beautiful setting with large glass windows allowing a nice view of outside, and the kitchen is in full view behind glass as well. We got the 2-course pre-theater dinner, and I can't see how we could have even considered the 3 course (includes dessert) as we were so stuffed. One of my mantras is that you can often tell a great restaurant from the initial bread serving; and theirs forecast a great meal. Grissini is often bland, but here it was actually flavorful; you could tell they put great care into the herb and salt flavorings. Then the focaccia was to die for! Perfectly baked with herbs and salt with a high end EVOO to drizzle on it that was also fantastic.My first course was a lamb bacon pappardelle that they make in house. Amazing flavors! The red sauce was nice and spicy. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had any where.Second course was a short rib with a red wine sauce. The meat was so tender and juicy, reminded me of the quality I once had at Michel Richard's Citronelle in DC.I was thoroughly impressed with the wine list by the glass, which I had to order since my dinner partner doesn't drink much wine. They use the argon Coravin system allowing them to really have some outstanding choices (the Brunello di Montalcino Ciacci Picollomini was a nice surprise by the glass and this 2012 vintage lived up to previous amazing vintages from this BdM master).It was my partner's birthday, they brought out a large white plate with two delicious bite sized desserts and a candle. A nice way to finish the dinner.The service was fantastic as well. We were unable to eat all our focaccia, so we asked for the rest to go; the wait staff insisted to wrapping up freshly baked focaccia for us instead of what we had on the table... very classy.Without a doubt, I'd go back for every show at the Met and surrounding venues.",4,0,0,Donald T.,"Silver Spring, MD",36,15,3

5.0,9/27/2017,"My mom and I had a wonderful dinner at Lincoln Ristorante before seeing Swan Lake. They currently have a mandatory pre-theater menu from 5-7 which gives a two or three course option. We decided to get one two course and one three course and split dessert so not to be too full during the ballet. For drinks my mom had a big easy capizzi and I went with the fuochetto l'orsetto which is the restaurant's take on a smoky margarita. I looooved it and especially enjoyed the gingered sea salt rim. For our antipasti we had the pappardelle with lamb ragu and the squash and mascarpone ravioli. Both dishes were outstanding and huuuuuge portions. The lamb bacon in the ragu was so flavorful and the dish had a nice kick to it. The ravioli was perfectly cooked and finished with truffle butter. For secondi we had the chicken and Tuscan seafood stew. Once again, huge portions. The chicken was moist and had a thing layer of lardo and fennel stuffing spread under perfectly crispy skin. The seafood stew had a nice selection of shellfish. My only complaint of the night was that I thought the stew had a slight fishy taste and smell. As our meal progressed, we realized we would not have time for dessert so we asked if we could pack up the rest of our main courses and take dessert to go. Our waitress, who was absolutely amazing (I think her name was Carrie), suggested we could come back after the ballet for dessert if we liked. We readily agreed and she even offered to store the rest of our food in the fridge so we did not have to take it with us. We returned after the show and had the exquisitely rich chocolate pine nut dacquoise to end our excellent meal. It was so nice to relax and enjoy our dessert instead of rushing through and it was kind of the restaurant to accommodate our return (and slow eating...).",4,1,2,Alexandra K.,"Jersey City, NJ",228,149,538

I say head waiter, because we were taken care of my multiple people, including one of the Chefs - Thomas, who was so kind to give us a wonderful explanation of the dishes being served that evening.There was 6 of us, and the oval table is very well suited to allow for conversation among everyone. We all ordered the price fixe with 4 courses.The cold soup that started the dinner was amazing. I followed up with the Tuna, but everyone else enjoyed their antipasti. I think the winners were the CREMA DI MOZZARELLA and CRUDO DI TONNO. For primi the winner was the CASARECCE AL GRANCHIO, but the pappardelle and risotto were both delicious. For secondi, the Sea Bass was the winner. The fish was very fresh, not at all fishy tasting and the sauce was delicious.

1.0,7/8/2017,"This review is strictly for the service, particularly the 2 maitre d's who work there on Saturday 7/8 at 1pm. I've been to Lincoln many times around lunch and they have been able to accommodate us with our baby in his stroller. I have never been treated with such disrespect at a higher end restaurant in NYC than that day. Upon arriving at the front desk, the 2 maitre d's essentially saw our stroller, and short of turning us away, just told us that there was no capacity except for a tiny cramped table outside. I found it hard to believe given that the restaurant at the time was at 50 PERCENT capacity with plenty of empty tables around. Then we were told we could eat at the bar and that the stroller would not be an issue - even though we were upset we couldn't eat at any of the empty tables, we obliged. Upon sitting at the bar, almost 5 minutes later, we were told yet again to move our stroller to make room for other people - we tried to, but there was no room to put it. We were essentially forced to leave the restaurant; even after that, I asked politely again if we could sit at any of the empty tables closer to the entrance - the maitre d's again said they were at capacity and nothing could be done. This is ridiculous. You need to train your staff better - this is no way to treat potential customers. This also serves as a warning sign for any future families who would like to bring their young children to this establishment - this is not a place that will accommodate you. They will make you feel like you are disrupting their business even though you are a paying customer.

1.0,5/23/2017,"Stinkin' Linkin'. Avoid this tourist trap which appears to cater to bridge and tunnel consumers from New Jersey and Long Island who have no taste. The diners here simply can not tell good food from bad food, it is all the same to them. Lincoln's business model is apparently built on this phenomenon.So is White Castle.At a recent pre Chamber Music Society evening I went with my beloved after being influenced by the Glass enclosed modernist design and hoped this restaurant would have the appeal of a European restaurant where design, food excellence and ambiance are paired in culturally significant settings. No luck at the Lincoln. When my fish arrived, the inside was either raw or possibly partially frozen. We sent it back and were ignored. Instead. We were besieged with multiple offers of bread and crackers. The food came back both a bit burnt and cold which was weird and possibly hard to do as it one would think this involves heating something up the food then chilling it. Big thermodynamic mystery there. This must be a proprietary recipe of the Lincoln. More offers of bread continued to be made. If I wanted raw fish I would have gone to a sushi bar, burnt stuff I would have well ordered burnt stuff, or for bread I would have gone to a bakery. All would have been more authentic then the raw, the burnt and the bread at Lincoln. The staff was obsequious in an obnoxiously cloying manner and this is not a substitute for proper staff training or decent food. Genuine care appeared to be absent and instead the diners were massaged with treacly, phony concern -- and bread. Constant meaningless interruptions are another huge problem which many Americans confuse for proper service or caring.This would never happen in Italy and there diners would throw food of this poor quality back and walk out. I should have done so as it was an insult to be served such garbage. Management offered a cloying sorbeto plate which I tasted and was not very enticing -- think Associated Supermarket taste more than the essence of fruit. I would love it if Lincoln closes and someplace worth dining at opens there instead, but given the strong demand for no taste restaurants by no taste customers, it will likely flourish. As far as being a special place worth an evening out or the $125 price for two, Lincoln is strictly from the the Emperor's New Clothes playbook of style over substance. Go to Blimpie's instead. It has more class than Lincoln.Summation: Do the world a favor and avoid. This place is for victims only.",0,0,0,John M.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

That even seemed tough, as was my octopus.Our waiter, aware that I was going to the Opera, did not think anything else could be prepared in time.  In fact they served me an Eggplant parmesan which was not remarkable except for the very thinly sliced eggplant.  No one checked back to see if this substitution was ok.  In fact, I didn't have time (although we allowed 1.5 hours for dinner before the performance) to have more than a few bites.  It was packaged for us, but leaked tomatoey oil all over the packaging and bag before we got it home.  I would not recommend this restaurant despite the pretty setting, beautiful nearby fountain and proximity to the Met Opera.

If you are not this lucky (it was very lucky - make a reservation before going!), there is always an option to sit at the bar with the same menu.

On point. Before we received any food, we have a small tasting of some bread with ricotta (plain), fish with caviar on a cracker (very good), and thin bread sticks with pepper (also great!). All were compliments of the chef for the day. Our anti-pasti were the Burrata (2 people had this - 3 out of 5 stars, tasty but not incredible), Insalata Misticanza (big portion, but very good), and the Polpo alla Griglia. The Polpo was tough and paired with massive mushrooms that lacked flavor. We opted for the 3-course pre fixe, all of us choosing pasta for our entrees. The GARGANELLI VERDE CON RAGU VITELLO dish was excellent, though beyond al dente - which I could get past. My fiancée had the TAGLIATELLE CON TARTUFO NERO which was superb, but wished for a more truffle flavor (don't be fooled by the massive truffle shavings - it was a lost flavored overpowered by the butter cream sauce). Then there was my mother-in-law and her sister. Both from Italy. One ordered the LINGUINE CON VONGOLE (Linguine with Clams). The other ordered STROZZAPRETI CON ARROGOSTA (pasta with lobster in a red sauce). Before I get into their dishes, I want to preface it with that none of us are crazed healthy, must have gluten free pasta type people. We like to eat, and we like to eat food that is prepared well. And both of these dishes are fairly traditional Italian. What happened with both dishes was a heavy hand of butter. I'm not talking just the taste. I'm talking the pasta was swimming in it. So bad so, we had to send the dishes back. Something I can't remember when was the last time we have done that at a restaurant. After explaining the problem, the waitress and manager were very apologetic. They made the dishes without butter (and seemed surprised that was the request, even though that isn't a traditional ingredient), and both dishes came back much better. For dessert, we had TARTUFO, TRIO DI GELATI, GIANDUIOTTO, and FRUTTI DEL FRUTTETO - which the Italians got a kick out of the last name. All four desserts were nothing to write home about, but also totally fine dessert. All in all, Lincoln isn't going anywhere. Us ourselves would probably go back for a drink and a cheese plate because of its great location to so many theaters. It is a restaurant that puts on a good show while dining (great service, same time plating, great upscale vibe, great cocktail and wine list etc), but behind that smoke and mirrors, at the end of the day the food falls short to not justify their star.",2,0,0,Eunic O.,"Manhattan, NY",3,13,13
4.0,1/6/2017,"Very solid 4.  Ambiance is glass house modernist with, of course, a nice view of Lincoln Center.  Agnolotti and veal (which I think was dry aged) were my favorite things.  The quality is very high, but almost as if it's just high enough to justify the prices and no more.  The portions are a little too precious.  The 48$ ""veal chop"" was a veal _medallion_.  Go to Keens, they will show you what a $48 chop looks like, tu Wong fu. Pretty great place for a drink and light snack but perhaps not a full dinner (Marea is right around the circle if that's what you want). Also, and the key instigator of the 4, shout out to the last ingredient in the Strozzapreti, which is a stinky, salty, sardine-like fish that infuses the entire dish, even the lobster - I'm aware that sardines are used to flavor sauce in Italy, but this was overkill in a bad way.  But, perhaps you like that kind of thing, you f*kking weirdo.",0,0,0,Chris K.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,333,8
1.0,12/31/2016,"Selected their white truffle pasta tasting menu for our month-iversary dinner. There were 4 courses, each adequately prepared but no standouts.

3.0,12/27/2016,"Our meal was set with very high expectations at the beginning. Everything started out great! From the attentive service and explanation of the menu items/drinks and pairings, to the breadsticks and foccacia, our dinner was set for a 10/10!I ordered the pasta tasting, which comes with four different pastas for $55. The bf got the prix fixe menu which comes with an antipasti, primi or secondi, and a dolce for $65. They time the dishes well so we can eat our entrees together. I'll go through the pasta tasting first:--Ravioli Bigusto: squash, sage, brown butter = delicious!! I love this combination of earthy flavors with a bit of sweetness. It was a great start to the tasting--Spaghetti alla chitarra: saffron pasta with clams, uni, sea beans = my favorite of the night! Pasta was al dente and the seafood wasn't overcooked. There was a hint of citrus in the sauce. I could eat a full serving of this one!--Strozzapretti con aragosto: lobster, tomatoes, breadcrumbs= this one was just ok. I enjoyed the lightness of the tomato sauce since the other 2 were a little heavy. I didn't like the actual pasta in this as much--Garganelli verdi con ragu di vitello: spinach pasta with veal ragu= THE WORST ONE.. It's a shame we ended with this because I was so unhappy with it! This type of pasta is a rolled one, so the edges are cooked, but as you go towards the middle of the pasta (with the most layers rolled), it was barely cooked at all.. The veal ragu was also very salty. Ended up not finishing this dish. Prix fixe:--Grilled octopus antipasti: Good char/grilled flavor and not overdone. I'm always skeptical when it comes to octopus because many places overcook the meat and it becomes chewy and hard. Although the pieces were thick, it was nicely done.--Beef sirloin with honeycrisp apples and celery root: When this dish first came out, I was so confused at the presentation. I guess this is why there's no pictures on yelp! The meat was covered by celery roots so it almost looked like a salad. When you push all that green out of the way, you see a good portion of sliced steak. We asked for medium rare, which it was on one side.. but as you went down the piece of steak, it was more cooked, and ended on a medium/medium well. ?? Also ended up not finishing this dish--Gianduiotto: last but not least, DESSERT! delicious hazelnut chocolate cake. Very similar to a ferrero rocher chocolate because of the little crunchies inside the cake. Loved the dessert, but way too full to finish it!Overall, a very decent amount of food. But disappointed with a few of the dishes. What started as a great meal, ended on a poor note :( Their pasta tasting is a great way to try different pastas  and the portions are perfect.",5,0,0,Kimmy U.,"New York, NY",226,417,1333

4.0,12/19/2016,"Lincoln has an amazing space, the seating is comfortable yet spacious. The service is attentive and consistent. The reason that i cant give five stars is that the cooking has become more corporate, less creative and much less interesting than it used to be. During my two recent visits we tried the pasta tasting menu (tasty but not memorable)' several fish dishes which were not impressive and the bistecca, which had little flavor.

However, I was offered gluten free pasta and when it came out it was overcooked and falling apart. I would have said something but I had waited almost two and a half hours to get my pasta and I was too hungry to send it back. The wait service was extremely slow - two of us were there 3.5 hours and not because we were slow. Long time between courses. When they brought the bill, they had double charged us for an item and we had to wait another 20 minutes to get their attention and get it resolved.

4.0,10/29/2016,"10/29/2016 pre opera dining 6:00pmI would like to start by offering Lincoln my visit date as I hope this helps identify the failing service component which plagued my visit and overall experience.Overall I can tell you the plates and presentations in my party were all in line with Excalibur of restaurant and it's head chef. The Peking Duck was excellent as we're the other dishes. I would recommend they consider a cart for cutting the portions instead of two people balancing plate and tray while carving table side, it's just odd. Aside from observing this awkward dance, it was not a problem.The problem in service is clearly in the lack of sophistication exhibited by staff to patrons that demand it in this location. The staff is in some cases young and untrained, swooping in and removing plates as if to rush. It's not something I'm accustomed to. There was one you man that did make eye contact, asked how the meal was and then said may I clear this for you. One and only one. He wore glasses so make a note!",0,0,0,Team M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
3.0,10/27/2016,"I was there for lunch--my first time. For $38, you get the beautiful space, excellent service, and a rather clunky menu with only OK flavors.I had the prix fixe lunch, and chose the insalata misticanza, which was a bed of frissé, some noodled beets and not much else, with a vinaigrette that was so, so heavily laden with vinegar that it made my eyes water. The amuse bouche was a sweet/savory pumpkin or butternut squash soup, served in a tiny mug, with a tasteless froth and amaretti crumbs; almost flavorless, and served at an absolutely scalding temperature.For my main, I had the ravioli bigusta, which was much more well balanced, but was almost a sweet dish, and with only 6-7 1"" ravioli, it was not enough to even touch my hunger.

As soon as you enter you feel relaxed because it's not ear-splittingly loud like so many popular places. The design of the room is open and modern, and the glassed-in kitchen is fun to see. The service is very professional, and our server answered all our questions and made helpful suggestions.In addition to super-skinny/spicy breadsticks, they bring out an iron skillet of fresh foccacia, which is quite nice. Last night the chef's offering was small bricks of fried mozzarella with the most exquisite tiny anchovies laid on top -- delicious! We all had cocktails and were very happy with them. Several of us had the sturgeon and caviar appetizer, which was lovely and my husband and I shared the duck for two. Our only complaint is that we would've liked the skin on the duck to be crisper, but it was a minor fault because the duck itself was delicious. My brother-in-law had the zucchine di almondine, which was roasted squash, pureed and topped with toasted nuts and pomegranate seeds. You think ""squash -- big deal"" but it was fantastic, and I ate most of his dish (he's very tolerant)!We did the three-course prix fixe and we were stuffed.

4.0,8/1/2016,"Pretty solid four-star Italian place, definitely qualified for a Michelin-star however I did not quite understand the reason that they lost their star two years ago. Arrived slightly earlier than the reservation time and the restaurant was surprisingly, only half-filled. We decided to go with the four course prex-fixe given the fact that both of us were starving. Not really a rice person, I had to admit that after the first bite, I completely fell in love with my lobster risotto, with black truffle only making it more flavorful. The squid ink pasta, on the other hand, carried a chewy texture that I really enjoyed together with the clam meat. Second courses were a bit less amazing compared with their pasta (probably that's the reason they also offered pasta tasting menu?), yet I do recommend the halibut if you prefer a lighter meal. I also liked my strawberry semifredo, while the chocolate cake was on the sweeter side.Since my friend and I were sharing many dishes, Lincoln was considerate enough to prepare plates so that we could easily divide the food; many times our waiter simply pre-divide for us. Would like to come back for their pasta-tasting for sure! One minor thing, the appetizers felt to me a bit weak and did not carry too many signature elements - shrimp on the sour side, and tuna a bit lack of flavor.

Set underneath a dramatic sloped (and fenced-off) ""rooftop lawn"" at Lincoln Center, it's very much the NYC version of a verdant-topped hobbit hole. Inside, it was mostly empty on a Sunday early evening, and felt pleasant and open but private at the same time. We only got drinks. Most everything on the cocktail list is based off vermouths. The wine list is extensive and, appropriately, quite Italian. No food of any sort is allowed at the bar area - either at the bar, or at the cozy cocktail tables nearby.The cocktail list of course dots its descriptions with interesting-sounding flourishes. But essentially my friend got their take on a sazerac, which was fine. I got their version of an Aperol spritz, which I should've known would be too light and cloying for my liking.Service was polite, both affected and warm at the same time.

Given my terrible experience at Per Se and the fact that the head chef hails from over yonder, I was admittedly a bit wary coming here. However, I was humbled by my experience. For the brunch, the first course consists of either an antipasti or primi, and the second consists of the primi or secondi. Plenty of quality choices exist, and I had a difficult time deciding between the oxtail and foie gras terrine, chestnut pasta with wild boar ragu, smoked chili pasta with white shrimp, and veal sweetbreads. I ended up going for the latter two, and was very happy with my choices.Before the first course even arrives, the onion foccacia in a cute little cast iron pan does. Did I ask for a second? I may have. No shame. Then, the amuse bouche--a crostini with mushrooms and (I believe) parmesan was delectable.My smoked chili pasta was the star of the meal. It was an absolute flavor bomb and very complex, with the brightness of the chili flavor, bitterness from the rapini, and sweetness of the shrimp, and what tasted like a hint of black garlic puree. The breadcrumbs augmented the texture of the dish as well. Sweetbreads were rich and creamy and paired well with the brightness of the blood orange.The only downer was the dessert--I got a trio of gelatos: parsnip, celery, and Campari. While I certainly tasted the Campari and celery, the parsnip, which I was most excited about, tasted like plain vanilla to me, and was overwhelmed by the cinnamon cookie crumbles. The gelatos were all very sweet as well. If not for the desserts, I'd definitely give Lincoln 5 stars.Come for the savory dishes, and head to Maison Kayser for dessert!",0,0,0,Jess W.,"Manhattan, NY",269,39,27
1.0,4/9/2016,I live in New York and eat out frequently. I eat at expensive and reasonable restaurants and am alway happy. The meal I had at the Lincoln was the worst meal I have ever had.My friend and I decided to share. We ordered the asparagus and mushrooms. The asparagus were edible and very salty but the mushrooms were et edible and so salty it was impossible to eat.we sent it back and the second order was just as bad and we didn't eat it. We then decided to share the monk fish and the sweetbreads. We couldn't cut the monkfish it was so tough.the sweet breads were so so and the order so small we could barely share. The monk fish was sent back and again was terrible. We barely ate anything and no mention of it was made by our waitress. No Manager came over and nothing came off the bill. To say something nice the bottle of wine we had was good. If you want to go go a pricey restaurant go to my favorite Le Grenouile. The food and flowers are amazing.

Sicilian Cassata(Beet Cake, Cocoa Nib Brownie, Cannoli -Vincotto Milk Chocolate Gelato, Meringue)Sorry to say I didn't care for the Sea Bass with clams or my friend's Scottish Sea Trout.  The Sea Bass's sauce/flavors were a bit overwhelming and a bit too salty/fishy.  The Sea Trout was better but still a bit fishy flavored.  Overall an excellent and relaxing time/dining experience in the Lincoln Center area.  Would come back and would recommend.  Just would try other entrees.",0,0,0,Ali T.,"New York, NY",0,134,52

The adorable bread with roasted onions and potato that came out in a little cast iron pan was a really nice touch. And the complimentary petit fours at the end made up for the $40 entree we ordered - the seafood stew. Definitely for one person that's not that hungry but I'm sure it's the right portion for a European...another words not on American standard portion which is super size all. The beet and ice cream cake was gorgeous and it came with a side of fudge filled merengue which my 4 yr old enjoyed cracking. I love exotic or untraditional ingredients in my food. That's when I'm happy to pay a little extra for my food. Beauty, good taste, and high quality ingredients is what you'll be getting here. The restaurant is really beautiful as well.

Good God, why are there so many Asian people in their early 20s eating here?I was sitting next to these ABCs (that's American-born Chinese, for all the gwai-los reading this) - clearly first-year analysts at an investment bank - who were name-dropping Morgans and Stanleys like you wouldn't believe.

I commend you on all the pitchbooks you've crushed, and kudos, you excel at Excel, but this is not the 80s, you are not Christian Bale, and being able to hear how ""my Managing Director made me work late last Friday, oh my God"" while sitting two tables over is criminally obnoxious. 3.

2.0,2/14/2016,"Mother once told me never judge a book by its cover. Lincoln has taught me that saying also holds true for restaurants. Nestled inside Lincoln Center, the location is prime and the interior of the restaurant is equally as wonderful. Even the wait staff is nice enough though it lacks the polish one would expect from a fine dining experience. On 2 separate occasions, for example, waiters attempted to clear while we were visibly and actively eating from the plates. Moreover, the open kitchen concept sounds like a good idea until you are forced to hear the foul-mouthed executive chef berate his assistants at every turn throughout the meal. At one point, he was yelling at someone in the kitchen for 10 straight minutes in a tirade laced with profanities and vulgarities which left every table near me appalled. It felt as if we had all been teleported to Hell's Kitchen and subjected to Gordon Ramseyesque outbursts. Unfortunately, changing the channel was not an option. Keep in mind my father owns a restaurant; I understand things can get heated in the kitchen, but these chefs are exposed to restaurantgoers in plain sight and sound so what they say and do affects (in this case, quite negatively) the overall experience. But that alone is not actually what warrants the low rating, at least not in my mind. The food itself was sub-standard, especially when compared to the price point. I started with the risotto with black truffle. The risotto itself was thoroughly overcooked. The risotto's morbid texture combined with an overwhelming amount of sauce left me wondering whether I had ordered a pastina soup. The truffles were good but even they could not salvage the dish. Next, I tried the braised short ribs that were tender but nothing more.  The ribs were devoid of flavor, seasoning, or even another texture (i.e. potato strings) to offset the softness of the meat. As a result, it became cloy after only a few bites and felt like something served at Cracker Barrell -- that is, the dish was neither creative or skillfully crafted. Anyone with a crock pot and a few hours of time could replicate the result.Needless to say, we didn't stick around for dessert.",3,0,0,Anthony C.,"New York, NY",11,35,27

There was a smear of mustard and horseradish underneath, which I thought hit me a bit too hard and I probably could have done without. The Radicchio, which looked crazy and inedible, was actually the tastiest part of that dish, with a great mix of oil and salt. I ate it all.I also got the Dorade, which was very tasty and well cooked, and thoroughly enjoyed the roasted vegetables that came with it.The lemony ricotta cheesecake was pretty good and not too dry and ricotta-y.Also got the Tramonto Al Sud (bourbon and sweet), which came out pink in a martini glass, but I enjoyed it proudly anyway.Loved the ambiance of the restaurant and the views of The Juilliard school and the Lincoln Center.

3.0,1/24/2016,"Came here for restaurant week lunch during the snow storm. Despite my caveats, it was still worth the trip all the way up there. They come off as unassuming but still polished, friendly and inviting. The service there was very friendly and on pointe, and I loved the open kitchen concept. Some places that have similar open kitchen ideas merely allow you to have a peak into a small part of the kitchen in a far distance from your dining table, but I really appreciated the full exposure into the entire kitchen process here. It was a very unique experience and clear glass walls was an excellent touch to the entire presentation and decor of the restaurant. While the service and ambiance was nice, the food fell a little short. Granted, the food itself was good but nothing really stood out and just fell short of other dining experiences I have had. I ordered the oxtail terrine, pork belly and apple bread for dessert. The terrine was okay and the positive point was that it wasn't too salty. The pork belly was somewhat dry and could have used some more flavoring or something added to make it stand out more. The dessert could have been better. I felt that I definitely need to accompany a bite of the bread with the ice cream in order for the bread to not be too dry and a little lacking in flavor.

2.0,1/16/2016,"Let's start with the service:It left you wanting to give up on the fine dining industry. Reservations were made, and when we showed up on time we were left to stand there by a rude hostess for twenty minutes. When finally seated we had the delight of experiencing their ""Are you going to spend a lot of money? "" twist on service. Let's add some context here. My wife was pregnant, and uncomfortable driving in NY, so out off decency for both, I chose not to drink as well. The waiters first words were ""What would you two like from the wine or drink list?"" We told him that we wouldn't be drinking, and why, and you could see the change in his face, and the change in service from there on was sour.We took a while browsing the menu, if you're going to spend that kind of money at a new place to you, you're going to make sure to get what you want. Taking too long to order and not wanting to drink got us down graded in their service system to no service at all. I had to track down our waiter myself to order.  I ordered a multi-course dinner, with the best item of each to include the expensive add ons suggested.My wife ended up getting a $100 plate of Gnocchi. My meal was $210, so we're up there off the bat.But that wasn't enough for the staff to warrant us good service, or any service. Our dishes were brought and taken by the table bus girl, and she ended up having to take our desert order and get our bill. She knew what was going on and even confirmed it to us, and felt bad. The whole dinner, our waiter was at the table next to us with two guys who were eating a little, and drinking some of everything on their wine list. Couldn't attend to us, the non drinkers who ended up spending over $400 on our experience. The food:The Gnocchi was good, my dishes were very good. The food was good, tiny portions, so tiny in fact that we were still hungry, so we ordered desert and latte's, which was a great idea. The desert we ordered was the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, and I've eaten the world over. The waiter who couldn't bother with us and the hostess who treated us like street trash, (We were dressed to the nines, I was in a grey cotton suit with bostonian shoes, and my wife's dress was the most expensive outfit that was there that night)no tip for them. Instead, I gave a $100 tip to the bus girl in cash, another $40 on the ticket with a note on the ticket that it is hers as well, because she's the only proper server in the place.

4.0,1/3/2016,"The food, and service here are excellent! If price is an issue, do stay away as this is rather expensive spot. But, hey it's Lincoln Center... what do you expect?FOOD:  - Portion sizes were actually larger than expected! I have come to grips with the larger the price tag, the smaller the portion size. This place, however, is an exception. I was actually almost full half way through the meal (and I have a decent sized appetite).  - Taste wise, everything was spot on! The components that should have be the star, were the star. I had the four-course pre-fix meal. To start was the scallop & park belly, followed by the squid ink past ravioli stuffed with lobster/scallop, then the venison dish, and finally the brown butter genovese with hazelnut gelato. The reason for the 4-star instead of 5-star review is that I felt that the actual ""Italian"" dishes were not spectacular. The sauce with the ravioli was a tad too acidic for my opinion. The rather fresh seafood made up for the acidic bite though. If this weren't an Italian place, then the review would be 5 stars!  - Variety... lots of variety! You will have tons to choose from  - Dessert was spectacular! I have not always considered Italian places to have the best dessert, but my compliments to the chef, for sure! As I write this I wish I had more of it haha.  - Overall the meal was delicate, yet filling. I was completely satisfied, did not feel terrible afterwards, and definitely feel like venturing back!The service was amazing, and I could not rave more about it. Everyone was knowledgable, and kind. But, then again, this sort of world class service is what you expect from a restaurant of this caliber.Bottom Line - great spot to grab a bite to eat prior/after a show. Even if you're just in the area, I recommend a stop in. My one qualm is that this is not an ""Italian"" restaurant in my opinion.

However, our service was awful.  At first I thought it was because many people were rushing off to see a show.  But even after the place cleared out, it took forever.  Even simple things like bringing bread, a second glass of wine, the dessert menu - just took forever.  Our food was so-so.  We started with the carpaccio which was just missing something, like mustard.  I also had the Pappardelle and it was missing that deep, rich meat flavor.  My husband was also indifferent about his food.  Our friends said it was the worst service they ever had there and we must have had a new waiter so maybe we had an off night.  For the price, I would never go back.",1,0,0,Deb R.,"San Mateo, CA",5,90,11
2.0,11/18/2015,"We informed them we had had theater reservations, and allowed 2.5 hours for our meal. This would have been sufficient had it not been for several issues. The service was formal. But ""formal"" is not the same as ""good"". The first course came before the second course (which was sent back so we could receive our food in the proper order). The coffee came before the desert. And the desert wine (included in the pre-fix) was completely forgotten (despite asking for it 3 times). The desert itself (not the type requiring preparation) took 30 minutes to be served, despite the fact that we asked this be expedited. Realizing how incompetent and slow the service was, we asked for the check when ordering desert (and again when the coffee came, and again following). I would normally have argued not to pay for desert as we had no time to eat it, but was not able to as it took 40 minutes for them to deliver our check, and we had to rush away. I feel literally robbed. And after all of this, our waiter acted like we were the ones inconveniencing him, not the other way around.For the food, this place could have received 4 stars.

The low sloping wood ceiling (I felt like a hobbit, but in a cool way) in contrast with the glass walls that make up the restaurant and the metal fixtures. Basically, A+ for interior design. We came at night so looking out into a darkened Lincoln Center was very intimate and cozy. The kitchen is also on view which is super cool, I saw glimpses of chefs plating, broiling, sous-videing during my meal - such fun! The service was impeccable, friendly and extremely professional. Our party all opted for the 3 course meal. I had the buratta as the starter, in comparison to my company, I definitely made the best choice. My brother had the carpaccio which was also excellent. As an entree I went with the pork milanese which was excellently prepared and very generously portioned (I couldn't finish it..gulp..I embarrasingly asked to take it home which they willingly obliged). The dish also came with rye-carroway spaetzle which I found really unique and flavorful. Mommy Dearest had the strozzapreti pasta which I thought was excellent as well as the braised peking duck Lil Bro had - very tender and served with a side of creamy polenta. Dessert also did not disappoint, my riccotta alla crema (?) was fantastic. They also served some pastry puffs with cannoli cream with the check.

5.0,9/22/2015,"I came here with my girlfriend before the ballet, and we both left incredibly happy.We opted for the 4 course prix fixe with wine pairing option (the wine pairing had generous portions and a very knowledgeable sommelier), and it was fantastic. The menu isn't overly complicated, with about six options for each course, but the choices were varied as far as types of meat (or non-meat if you're vegetarian), so you can try something new for each plate. I opted for the salmon, wild boar ragu (highly recommend it), and whatever the beef option was. For dessert I had the cheesecake with pomegranate sorbet, which was out of this world!The service was incredible. I suppose it's to be expected at a restaurant like this, but they still surprised. When we asked for a different first plate because it was different than what we expected (our fault, not theirs), they didn't hesitate to apologize and immediately offer multiple alternatives, which they promptly brought to the table. Also, as soon as we sat down, they asked if we were going to be going to the ballet, and made sure the meals were brought to us in time for us to make the show with time to spare.As for the restaurant itself, it's a very classy, modern, intimate setting with great views of the Julliard School on one side and Lincoln Center on the other.

5.0,8/16/2015,"This is definitely one of my preferred Italian fine dining spots in the city and because it is strategically located in the middle of Lincoln Center it makes it even more desirable. The crowd is eclectic, with refined opera and ballet goers, chic fashionistas and other interesting types. One of my favorite things is to see what people are wearing here, and Bill Cunningham should certainly visit here for a sweeping view of the stylish NYC. It is relatively pricey if you are used to American portions of quantity over quality. I know that with the beautifully designed and crafted menu of either a Prix Fixe (3 or 4 courses - and option of wine pairings) or a la carte, I am always more than satisfied and rarely find the need for dolce.... though they never let you get away without a delightful off-the-menu treat that really satisfies.  Their menu is farm fresh and local when possible or imported from Italy for perfection. Here you will start your meal with grissini, focaccia and other delectable and fresh breads. For the carnivores, there is charcuterie: prosciutto, mortadella, cotton, spallata and speck, and even testa di maiale terrines along with other massacred animals made into sausages, cotechino, salted porchetta (sorry I am an animal lover and vegan!) but there are many seasonal ragus, fresh pastas and risottos and salads even and the menu changes to reflect different regions of Italy that means you can always find something new.My favorite seating is a booth for intimacy, but any table alongside the glass walls is a lovely way to enjoy your meal - expanding your view beyond the dining area.  Sit outside beside the Lincoln Center's reflecting pool and Henry Moore sculpture for a special treat, or inside next to the open view of the kitchen and be mesmerized as the precision and creativity unfolds.",6,2,3,Daniella S.,"Roslyn, NY",604,446,4135

So, basically, my friend and I were charged $12 for TAP WATER. They don't tell you any of this when you order ""bottled"" water -- I only found out after examining the bill, and questioning why we were charged for ""two"" waters.To add insult to injury, the portion size of the pasta entree on the Restaurant Week menu was embarrassingly small -- literally, it lasted three bites. I had to give my friend half of my decently sized pork entree so he wouldn't starve.

However, when it was returned to our table, it was still full of bones & the remaining portions were quite small. We called the Manager over again.

Worse, upon returning to our apartment, I realized that I had a small bone from the fish stuck in my throat. I called the Lincoln to report our experience, especially the fact that I had a bone stuck in my throat. I spoke to Nikki, Lincoln's Assistant Manager.

This restaurant has a wonderful concept, but it is INCONSISTENT, especially in the quality of its staff. Friends had warned me, but I had always had a superior experience at this restaurant before. Being inconsistent, Lincoln Ristorante fails miserably as an upper tier restaurant.   I and a birthday friend went there on a Saturday night in May, with an 8:30PM Opentable reservations requesting a booth. I've requested a booth a number of times; they're comfortable, and I like the view; plus, my booth request is always honored. The maitre(esse) d' couldn't find my reservations and said the booths were all reserved, but she'd see what she could do. Then, as she was about to seat us, she found my reservation. After seating us at a table, she never contacted us again. There were four empty booths as we sat down, and two were STILL empty when we left. I pointed out the empty booths to her during our meal, having hailed her as she rushed by, and her response was indifference. There's more, but I'll summarize by saying she was incompetent (not knowing how to use the computer reservation system) and seemed like she really didn't want to be at work that night.  The wait staff, on the whole, were decked out in frumpish garb and conspicuously clumsy, spilling water on the table as they poured and unable to remember their recitations of preparation names and ingredients.  My courses were excellent, as I always expect, with ingredients inventively combined and seasoned yet recognizably of the peninsula. My birthday mate was having a wonderful culinary introduction to the restaurant until his genially seasoned pork chop arrived--half fat. We were ""informed"" that the cut of pork in question always has high fat content--but half, or more!? I think not, and, if so, something else needs to be served. What meat was found in the chop had to be cut out from surrounding fat. Unacceptable. The waitperson took it back and offered a free replacement, which was declined (and that course was taken off of our prix fixe tab).   No ""manager"" was to be found as we left; and, the maitre(sse) d', as we exited, struggled to look task-attentive, for the first time that evening.",1,0,0,Ar S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

The crowd can be on the older side and it can get a little stuffy. I have noticed that they don't mind if you're not suited up - so don't even stress about that!

The food was just ok. I was not overly impressed with the flavor or the way anything was prepared. I had the venison, which was flavorless.

5.0,2/17/2015,"My boyfriend took me to Lincoln for Valentine's Day, and I have to say that it is now on my top 5 favorite restaurants in New York City. The food, service, and ambiance were all impeccable, and we had a wonderful time. Food: Appetizers - Prosciutto with Gala Apple Conserva and Octopus and Beef Tendon Terrine. The  prosciutto was perfect - everything from the taste to texture was on point. The terrine was likewise very good. I particularly enjoyed the way different textures complemented each other on the plate. Entrees - Agnolotti Di Sedano Rapa and Conchiglie Nere Con Fruitti Di Mare. We both really enjoyed the balance of flavor in both of these pasta dishes. The Conchiglie Nere in particular was a perfect blend of delicate flavors along with bold textures. The seafoods were perfectly cooked, and the light tomato sauce complemented them perfectly. Secondi - Boreto Di Grado and Brasato Di Manzo. This is the only course of the meal that I didn't completely love. The Boreto Di Grado should not have included the white polenta cake, which very quickly became soggy in the shellfish broth. However, the Brasato Di Manzo was perfect. The beef was tender and cooked just right, with light flavors that enhanced the authenticity of the meat itself. Dessert - Paitto Di Formaggi and Torta Di Perugia. My boyfriend got the cheese plate and thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the chocolate torta, and thought the hazelnut gelato perfectly complemented the cake. Ambiance: The ambiance at Lincoln is wonderful. The four walls of the restaurant are all glass, so every diner has a view of Lincoln Center. It has an open kitchen, where you can see the chefs working on different dishes. However, the open kitchen had a glass wall  separating it from the dining room, so no excess noise came into the dining room. Service: While the food was fantastic all through the four course meal, I have to say that the service was the true star of the show. While Lincoln is a one Michelin star restaurant, the service was comparable to that of a two or three Michelin restaurant. Our waiters and waitresses cleaned our table after every course, checked in on us at different points in the meal, and never let our water glasses get close to being empty. Despite the attention to detail, we never felt overwhelmed with the amount of service we received. They made the dinner go smoothly, and their presence enhanced the romantic mood of the evening rather than detract from it.

Also, there was no indication that the cuisine was entirely Italian, especially regional, such as Puglia, which is not exactly mainstream. One of the biggest problems with the restaurant is the staff. They are running about like nervous hens, filling your water glass every time you take a sip.  It is thoroughly intrusive. We felt sorry for them and overtipped as we knew they were under duress. It was so obvious that they were under the gun. The Chef, Benno, must be hard to deal with as he has an enormous staff in his see through kitchen--they all yell out the orders like it's their first day at CIA. They all need to have dinner at The Four Seasons and witness a laid back, uber professional staff, that steps in when needed, without being annoying house flies. The menu was so limited and they looked at one of my guests as though they were insane when they asked for potatoes and/or rice. The server replied, ""We don't ever serve those!"" It was so thoroughly disappointing and needlessly expensive for tasteless and, quite frankly, poor quality food.

But Lincoln Ristorante beats the odds. Everyone in our party of four found this meal completely satisfying -- the service was wonderful, the flavors were fresh and intense, and the portions were just right.

4.0,1/2/2015,"Lincoln Ristorante is a nice setting for a fancy date night.  Right by the Lincoln Center, you have views of the courtyard and reflecting pool.   Inside, you also get a full view of the busy kitchen at work.  The restaurant has a very modernist feel, with lots of glass walls, sharp angles, and neutral colors, which for some may seem too formal and cold. For my husband and I, we thought it was a nice change from the suburban restaurants we usually visit.What I liked about Lincoln is that they offer a prix fixe menu with either 3 ($60) or 4 ($75) courses, which works out better than ordering al a cart.  From the main menu, you choose 1 antipasti, 1 primi and/or 1 secondi, and 1 dessert.  The menu is seasonal so what I ordered may not be offered later on.    In any case, for antipasti, I recommend the PETTINI IN SAOR, roasted bay scallops or the SPIEDINO DI MARE, grilled octopus, shrimp, and scallop dish.  All the seafood was perfectly cooked and seasoned and accompanied with nice vegetables/beans/etc.For first course, I had the CONCHIGLIE NERE 29 CON FRUTTI DI MARE AL FRA DIAVOLO, squid ink pasta with seafood.  Again the seafood was great however the Fra Diavolo sauce tasted ordinary to me.  My husband chose the SPAGHETTI ALLA CHITARRA 28 CON VONGOLE, spaghetti with clams and sea urchin.   This dish had a very unique flavor which we enjoyed.  We expected to see pieces of sea urchin in the dish, but instead it is infused in the sauce.   My husband went ahead with a second course and had the loin of Venison.  He was hesitant ordering this at first but was glad he did.  He said the meat was very tender and delicious with the pepper paprika sauce.  Both desserts we chose were delicious, the chocolate balsamic cake with hazelnut gelato and the trio de gelati. To our surprise, along with the check came complimentary sea salt caramels and nougat candies.  As for the service, there was one main waiter and then a few other servers providing drinks, bringing the food to the table, cleaning the table, and taking the dessert order.  It seemed a bit impersonal to me but it was pretty efficient.

I got the frutti di mare fra diavolo with squid ink pasta - it was great. could have been a bit spicier for ""fra diavolo"" (I have a pretty low tolerance for spicy, but this was mostly just a red sauce). My mom got the veal ravioli with the white truffle shavings on top (extra $30). This  was her first time eating truffle and I think she actually did dab up all of the sauce on her plate with bread. It was great. I'm not a truffle fan, but it was awesome. The truffle was a hefty portion, so they didn't charge you 30 for nothing. Brought it out and sliced it directly on the plate. Made a show of it which was awesome. The service was out of this world. We felt taken care of but not annoyed. (Water glass was never less than 3/4 full if that is any indication).

3.0,12/8/2014,"I'm not sure where all the hype is coming from?Don't get me wrong, we saw a beautiful venue, open kitchen, great selection of wines, exquisite plating and not to mention great service. But so far as the food is concerned... good, but the fare wasn't anything above and beyond a Trio's chain.The appetizer scallops were good. The squid ink pasta wasn't anything special; the seafood was good, but the pasta itself was large shelled black pasta, and maybe on the thicker side so it was more carby than I'd like. The Braised wagyu. Well, the braised beef was very good, along with the reduction. But I think it was a little assuming for them to offer a non-serrated knife with my wagyu steak, because it wasn't THAT tender. My wife laughed at me trying to cut through the tissue in my wagyu with a straight edged knife. But it was a very pretty knife...Desserts were...uninspired. Chocolate cake was ok, and the quince was there...they finished the meal.The coffee was also top notch though, and we're kind of coffee snobs.Overall though, I know many people just a restaurant by the dining experience, but I weigh heavily on the food. But if I had to score the overall experience, if this was fine dining, they didn't pair the napkins to our dress (white linens to our dark ensembles), and they didn't clear the crumbs between platings. Plus I was a little miffed that they topped off my half full glass of sparkling water with flat.

3.0,12/5/2014,"52%Very hit and miss Italian.***Came here for dinner with a smaller group, Nov '14.Lincoln appears to be more of an upscale Italian restaurant with a blend of traditional Italian cooking with some creative touches.  The dinner menu is based on a prix fixe structure where the diner can choose from 3 courses for $60, or 4 courses for $75.  Since it was white truffle season, certain dishes carried a supp charge for truffle courses.  Therefore, dinner may have been closer to $125 per person before tax and tip.   Some diners may be interested to know that Lincoln holds a michelin star as of '14.  The restaurant is owned by the Patina group, which I find can be inconsistent with some of their restaurants being more capable than others.  Furthermore, the main chef Jonathan Benno came from acclaimed restaurant Per Se.  Unfortunately with our particular visit, he wasn't present in the kitchen.  I've not tried Per Se while Benno was cooking there, so it'd be unfair for me to make comparisons.Our table chose the 4 course, with each of us opting for a white truffle pasta.  We were not interested in a more elaborate tasting menu that evening, so we did not inquire if that were a possibility.  I'll get more into the individual dishes I sampled for dinner.  I didn't take notes at the time, so my recollections aren't as helpful as I'd wish.Trota Marinato E Caviale.  Citrus cured scottish sea trout, osetra caviar, roasted grapes, red watercress, grappa conserva.  dish rating 72%- A lighter, yet generously portioned trout that reminded me mostly of cured salmon dish.  It was enjoyable, executed nicely, although perhaps a tad conservative.  - The curing seemed mild with the saltiness in this balanced nicely with the more subtle fishiness from the trout.  The caviar complemented the fish well in flavor and texture.  Other condiments were less memorable, but by no means unpleasant.  Tajarin Con Tartufo Bianco.  Hand cut pasta, chicken sugo, castelmagno cheese, shaved white truffle.  dish rating, 55%- This is softer hand made pasta that visually resembles linguine to me, although it has a noticeably softer texture and isn't mildly chewy.  Here I found the pasta to be a tad thicker and a bit chewier than Tajarin I've had in the past.  I liked that texture and was thankful of the more generous portion of pasta and white truffle shavings.- Flavor wise, what made the most presence was a bold, rich chicken reduction meat sauce that lent a good sweet and salty presence to the pasta.  While aggressive, its not harsh and quite delicious.  It was intense enough where I initially mistook it for a beef reduction rather than chicken.- While the pasta itself was successful, I think as a white truffle course, the sauce muted the presence of the truffle as a flavor and texture.  The flavor of the truffle we had also appeared a bit muted, so I think the use of such a sauce seemed to defeat the purpose of using the fanciful ingredient.Cervo In Padella.  Roasted venison chop, red wine braised cabbage, cayuga pure organics polenta, black truffle sauce.  dish rating 10% (below average)- I requested 'rare' and it came out closer to medium well the first time.  After about 10-15 mins, the dish was returned closer to rare, however the grilling was very imprecise.  About a third of the outer layer of meat was brown and the very center was close to raw.  I would have liked to return this, but doing so a second time would have been awkward with companions.  This is totally embarrassing.- The flavor of the venison, unsurprising was rather muted and mostly just texture.  There may have been a smidgen of gaminess from the blood, but it might as well be 'beef' or mystery meat served on the plane.- The condiments were all capable, particularly the red cabbage that had a nice boozy presence, but it's insufficient if the main protein isn't quite acceptable.Review to be continued shortly.  Please refer to earlier review.",2,1,1,Adrian Robert H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",720,350,1747

The amuse Bouche was a burrata cheese on a baguette- interesting because the bread was sweet and the cheese was also sweet. Sweet on sweet but it works.The guitar spaghetti with sea urchin and clams was actually pretty good. I never had anything like this texture before and I like it a lot. The sea urchin was infused in the sauce and the pasta really clings onto the flavor. The clams were huge and fresh. The braised lamb ravioli was surprisingly flavorful ...I'm salivating just thinking about it. The roasted mixed mushrooms are so delicious! How can they infuse so much garlic and butter flavor into a mushroom?! This order was huge so definitely split it.The grilled and braised rib of beef was okay. It was beef prepared two ways and I don't think it was a wise choice.  I prefer the grilled way so much better and can't help but compare it to the braised beef.

Others had the burratta cheese which looked unappealing and did not illicit any ooous or ahhhhs from those consuming it.Next was the fancy pasta with white truffle. Pasta was dry and uneventful and the white truffle that was shaved onto my dish must have come from Lillyputian Land it was so small.Other mains were pan sautéed sturgeon, not great at all. Steak was outright tough.On the bright side we had great wine recommended by the Sommelier who was very pleasant knowledgeable and was one of the high points of the evening. Their whiskey list is great, with many hard to find whiskers at very fair prices. I would come back here just to sit at the bar for either whiskey or wine or both.

Now, having worked in this business for nearly ten years, I understand that mistakes happen and can easily be fixed. Well, needless to say, it wasn't so easy. I immediately called the restaurant, and while the hostesses were very kind and accommodating, I didn't even HEAR from the managers regarding this situation until yesterday afternoon.  That's FOUR DAYS of no response. When Misha, the manager, finally contacted me, saying that we were playing ""phone tag"" (me calling four times and leaving messages and you not leaving a message during the ONE time you actually called me back does not apply to the concept of phone tag), I expected to be told the same thing I theorized.Instead, I was told that the bank (Chase) actually charged me twice. He gave me this whole spiel about how in order to cover the payment, Chase likes to charge me twice in case the first payment wouldn't go through. The second charge would disappear within a few days. So not only did he imply that there was a chance I couldn't AFFORD my meal (I'm actually not doing too shabby, thank you very much), but that I was wrong in thinking that someone made a pretty common error.I'm sorry, sir. But you are mistaken. The charge was in succession over one night and it was before the tip went in. That means I was charged twice. I am the office manager at another restaurant. I know how charges work. When I pointed this out, instead of conceding, he wanted me to send him a COPY OF MY STATEMENT proving this. At this point, I was too astonished to argue any more, so I sent him a copy of the statement under the condition that he confirm he received it. It's sensitive information after all. Spoiler alert: he didn't.The charge finally disappeared, not because of him, but because Chase was kind enough to credit back what I was robbed of. I could forgive the double charge. I could forgive missing one, maybe even two messages. I imagine people are busy there. But I will not tolerate being reprimanded on how charges work nor will I be treated with probably the worst customer service I've ever received at a restaurant--from a manager, no less. And yes, it put a complete damper on whatever good food I had there that Saturday.So no, I will not be returning there and I will not recommend this restaurant to others. This place is like a shallow woman; beautiful on the outside, but patronizing and completely self-absorbed on the inside. I hope they improve that very soon.",3,1,0,Brittany G.,"Lakewood, CA",3,3,1

5.0,9/22/2014,"Where is The Lincoln and why haven't we been? The answer to both is Lincoln Center. Restaurants here, while wonderfully efficient, are woefully uninspired. It is a phenomon that is as pervasive as it is unfortunate. There is an inverse relationship to the brilliance that comes out of the concert halls of Lincoln Center and the quality of the food that comes out of the kitchens that surround it. And even restaurants that try their best to rise above the pre-theater fray more often than not succumb to the pressure of getting concertgoers in and out in time to make the curtain.  Here, cuisine always plays second fiddle to convenience and efficiency trumps excellence on the plate. And so when we arrived at The Lincoln last week before the opening night of the Philharmonic, we were ready for another lukewarm serving of adequate, average and acceptable. From the moment the hostess guided us to our table, thoughtfully swiveling each chair towards us, we sensed that were in for a delightfully different experience.  The Lincoln, in its design, approach to service and food has a refined confidence.  It stands out without showing off.  It never tires to be cool or of the moment, it just is. It is savvy, not snobby with a democratized dress code:  Here gowns and jeans both look like they belong and do. As my wife examined the menu (her job is to pick the food) and I perused the wine list (my job is to select the wine, which means I immediately summoned the sommelier) the waiter brought over an amuse bouche of liver moose. Flecked with pistachios it was at once rich and subtle, and so sublime those who normally turn their nose up at the mere mention of liver (i.e. my wife) found it irresistible. As for the meal itself, both appetizers and entrees--two pastas--were impeccably turned out. Our waiter, Joe, was knowledgeable, professional and just the right amount of familiar. The cherry on top was his encyclopedic knowledge of music, opera and the cultural goings on at Lincoln Center. We requested to be seated in his section when we made our reservation--happily we're going again this Thursday. The Lincoln is worth the trip even if you're not going to an event at Lincoln Center.",1,1,1,Michael R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0
4.0,9/15/2014,"When I first stepped into Lincoln Ristorante on a Friday afternoon, I looked behind the glass panels separating the kitchen from the dining room and spotted Jonathan Benno behind the line. Since the restaurant's opening in 2010, Benno has overseen the kitchen with a keen eye, and he's no stranger to professional kitchens. With decades of experience under Thomas Keller (Per Se, French Laundry), Tom Colicchio (Craft), and Marco Canora (Hearth), Benno is truly a ""chef's chef"", one who paid his dues, working his way down the line, to get to where he is now. In hindsight, perhaps I should have expected to see him there, scanning each and every dish that left the kitchen.His meticulousness is a key reason why Lincoln Ristorante remains one of the premier restaurants in the city today. Despite a rocky opening in 2010, the restaurant holds a Michelin star and is one of the most sought-after places for a pre or post-theater meal, given its vicinity to the Lincoln Center. The space is a gorgeous, two-storied masterpiece, from the glass walls, to the looming ceilings, to the unparalleled view of the reflecting pool that occasionally hosts performances throughout the day. It was a view I was happy to take in while going through the menu, as we'd planned in advance to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu offered for lunch.To begin: The Burrata e Lampascione. The central piece of this dish was the creamy buffalo milk-based mozzarella, a soft, rich, and subtlety flavored cheese that was a delight to eat just on its own. It was paired with heirloom tomatoes, hyacinth bulbs, and a sprinkle of peppery arugula, all components that offered contrasting tastes and textures to highlight the burrata. I was delighted the most by the mint salsa verde that finished off the plate, as it added even more lightness to the plate. The alternative Piatto di Salumi (a plate of cold cuts including prosciutto, coppa, and test) wasn't quite as impressive in comparison.This was followed by the main course, the Angello Brasato, Braised Lamb Shoulder. The dish had a generous portion of lamb braised in a thick, red wine-based sauce. The lamb was extremely tender with just the right edge of gameyness, and the sprinkling of bread crumbs and pecorino added a little salty tang to each forkful. The protein was plated over a bed of Swiss Chard mixed with Green Olives, a combination that surprisingly worked, especially with a hint of lemon present. It was a surprisingly complex and filling dish, an option that I was surprised they even offered for lunch, in retrospect.For dessert, I opted for the Crostata di Frutti di Bosco, the ""Fruits of the Forest"" Cake. The slice had a thick and crunchy cinnamon sugar topping, and the addition of summer berries was present in the filling as well as the side of macerated raspberries and blueberries. The cake was surprisingly light with just the right amount of sweetness, especially when paired with a scoop of pistachio gelato. It was gorgeously plated (enough, at least, to win the NYC Restaurant Week Dessert Photo of the week [1]), and almost all the credit for that goes to Pastry Chef Richard Capizzi. The alternative dessert, the Pasticciotto Leccese, or ""Custard Pie"" featured layers of almond cake alternated with lemon curd. A touch of fig marmalata and a side of buttermilk gelato finished off the dish, which I might have liked slightly more than the crostata, if just for the use of lemon.Lincoln continues to be one of the quieter, under-appreciated restaurants in NYC today. The dining culture focuses too much on the new and novel, and there isn't enough recognition for the places that have consistently served delicious plates of well-executed food. The neighborhood and clientele may skew slightly older than other areas of downtown Manhattan, but let that be an indication of what a hidden gem Lincoln is; the food might not surprise and awe, but it certainly won't disappoint either.--[1] instagram.com/p/rFljwrwG…",10,4,4,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

The dishes were simple yet so delicious; the ingredients really spoke for themselves.I had the burrata dish to start: burrata, heirloom tomatoes, melon. Again, simple but delicious.For my entree, I ordered the zuppa alla tarantina. The seafood was fresh, and the saffron broth was subtle and complementary. I could have done without the chickpeas, but that's because I don't really like chickpeas. I actually ate some of the chickpeas and didn't hate them! So, maybe the chickpeas are amazing to people who like them?I don't remember exactly what I had for dessert, but it was a cake-like thing with berries and ice cream.

Situated across the Mercedes Benz fashion week building, a lot was going on Saturday night. I went for the pri fix menu of a three course, wanting to try everything on the menu, started with a lobster, cream endive salad, than front the waiters suggestion had the parpadelle pasta Bolognese with mushrooms. I would not get that again, too salty and not a big fan of the mushrooms, which over powered the whole dish.

3.0,9/6/2014,"I've been to this restaurant 3 times in 5 years; mainly because when you're on the upper west side, there isn't a whole lot of options unless you have a huge limit on a corporate cred card or someone else is buying.  Case in point, the first time I ate at this restaurant was for a corporate holiday party where we had our own private dining room.  The food to me is ""just OK"".  I can't even recommend a favorite dish because nothing stood out.  At the corporate party, I believe I had a steak.  I'm sure it was good but it wasn't $36 good.  The 2nd time we just went back for drinks and apps.  Again, nothing too memorable there either.  Last night, some friends were in town (on a Friday night) and wanted a place near Lincoln Center so this fit the bill.  We made the reservation at 7PM and had a spot at 9:30PM.  This is quite amazing considering the fact that it's Fashion Week.  Again, the food was just OK.  I got a salad with pears and nuts.  It was good.  The wife got the pork chop.  This was definitely better in my opinion than the salad due to the sauce (though the wife thought the other way around).  Anyway, for those 2 dishes, a cheese plate for an app and 1 drink, the bill was over $110.  But what it doesn't have in memorable food, it more than makes up for in ambiance and service.  The place is quite spacious; it also feels upscale.  You can actually enjoy a conversation without having to yell like you do at typical NYC places.  It also means that there's a good chance you can get a reservation like we did with very little notice which was a total win.  Service-wise, they do a great job...almost too good.  They are constantly checking in on you and making sure everything is OK.  I actually think they can pull back on that slightly because it almost got annoying.  That said, I'd rather have that happening than nothing at all. If you need a place in that part of town, this restaurant will impress friends with the structure and service but the food may be a bit of a letdown in comparison.  Unfortunately, no food pics were taken with this review.",0,0,0,Brian B.,"Manhattan, NY",64,22,34
5.0,9/3/2014,"SOOOO good! Enjoyed the meal so much that we already plan to come back next week! To start: they bring 3 different options for bread and a hummus and amazing authentic olive oil from Italy. The fococcia is so good and I recommend getting that kind over the others! For our starter: we had the INSALATA DI LATTUGA ALLA SICILIANA RED AND GREEN ROMAINE LETTUCE, KALE, SICILIAN PISTACHIOS, GRILLED PEACHES, PECORINO PEPATO.... it was very good! i liked the combination of the grilled peaches with the fresh tasting vegetables. My only negative about this dish would be that there was slightly too much dressing but I am also pretty picky when it comes to dressings on salads and tend to like the dressing very light.Following our starters we had a Duo pasta dish. I really liked this because it allowed us to try two different pastas. We had the: SPAGHETTONI AL POMODORO POMMAROLA, CHERRY TOMATOES, LEMON, RICOTTA SALATA for one of them and the SPAGHETTI ALLA CHITARRA CON VONGOLE CLAMS, SEA URCHIN, GREEN ONION, CHILI, LEMON for the other. While I liked the spaghetti with tomatoes and ricotta, it was simple and felt I could get the dish anywhere. What really stood out was the spaghetti with clams. It was AMAZING and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it! Can't wait to come back and have it again!!Lastly, we shared: ROASTED HEIRLOOM CARROTS, HONEY, CHILI, ROSEMARY, RICOTTA DI BUFALA. These were very good and a great companion to the rest of our meal. It's a light dish that pretty much goes with anything!I can't wait to come back next week and have another delicious meal! The ambiance is also so pretty both outside and inside!

5.0,8/19/2014,"Hands down, Lincoln is one of the best restaurants, if not the best restaurant in Midtown west Manhattan.  My ex and i have been enjoying dinner here every couple of weeks for the last few years...unless one of us is out of town.  The respect we receive is unparalleled, and the service exceeds outstanding. The chef Jonathan Benno makes it a point to shake our hands when he has the time, and the bartenders are GENIUS!  Before I continue with the personal service, I have to say that the architecture of the building is so beautiful and contemporary with a little bit of old world charm.  The natural light is perfect and the open kitchen is visually stimulating.  Alright, back to the service... Although the some of the staff has changed, the service has definitely not changed.  As i've stated in other reviews, i do not eat meat of any kind and i mentioned a couple of times when we started going there, and have not had to mention it again.  As soon as we order our food, a complimentary vegetarian starter comes out for me, and something that wonderfully suits my ex's palate is presented to her.  The wine list is vast and always changing...which is something I highly appreciate.  This place is beautiful throughout the entire year, but when opera season begins, it's not only the perfect place for people watching, but conveniently located only steps away from the metro. opera house.  I spend more time at Lincoln during the season because I can easily have a wonderful dinner and walk to the opera without having to rush. Also,  now that fashion week is at Lincoln Center, i don't have to find a place to dine close by.  This is perfect for me before i head to the shows.  If we don't feel like thinking too much, we order the eggplant and squash parmesan and mixed mushrooms.  If we have more time to kill, we check out the newer plates and salads.  One more thing, this place is perfect for all that i stated above, but also for the great opportunities given to culinary students and future chefs and such..

4.0,8/12/2014,"Normally, I really dislike Restaurant Week with a passion only reserved for my hatred of brunch. However, a 3-course lunch at Lincoln Ristorante for $25 just can't be scoffed at [typically, a lunch here would run you well over $40]. I came here last Friday with my coworker at 1PM. The restaurant was pretty full, seemingly with tourists and those on expense accounts.-Piatto di Salumi: Excellent charcuterie board with proscuitto and other forms of cured meat. My only complaint is that it could use a touch more salt [perhaps that's my personal preference] and that it's not served with bread. -Agnello Brasado: Word of the day was 'fork tender' which is the only word that can be used to describe the lamb shoulder. It was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the bread crumbs on top for a textural contrast, and the green olive as a punch in the face after the meatiness and creaminess of the lamb and swiss chard. -Pasticciotto Leccese: My favorite part of this dessert was the almond cake with lemon curd. I especially enjoyed the pieces of almond sprinkled on top. The buttermilk gelato was delicate in flavor and kind of muted. And I think the figs on top just didn't work. I also ordered a coffee [$5] which came with a burnt sugar biscotti. The coffee was average but the biscotti was delicious! The complimentary cherry biscotti at the end of the meal however was cardboard-like and not worth eating. Did this ruin the meal? Not at all! I'd come back here in a heartbeat. __Worth nothing is the complimentary bread [foccia and sesame] with white bean spread and olive oil. Absolutely delicious.  The amouse bouche of mozzarella en corroza was outstanding. They should make this an appetizer! I was really impressed with the architecture and design of the restaurant.

The restaurant's location and surroundings are beautiful - there's a beautiful sloping green lawn roof next to/on top of it for star gazing. The inside was nice itself, with a slightly dark ambience to ""set the mood"" I guess. I would say I am a pretty harsh critic in general, but the service really won me over here. I am all about service and it was near perfect. Our waiter knew the perfect amount of attentiveness he had to give us. More on him later.The lady who came around with the bread was weirdly unfriendly and she had a large plate of bread, of which you could only pick one choice (I guess that's typical at a fancy place?) The wine recommended by our waiter was ON POINT. I forget the name but I remember it was a red wine and I drank 2 glasses. I prefer white. We all got a cucumber and grape gazpacho with crabmeat. I really enjoyed this unique tasting, but delicious, cold soup. Afterwards, I got the lobster pasta and it was DELICIOUS. The portion size was typical for a fancy restaurant, but filling enough. I would get that dish again. Wasn't too fishy and was exactly what I was craving.After dinner, we ordered a dessert for the birthday girl. I don't even remember what the slice of cake was, but it was delicious. Our waiter brought out 3 complimentary sorbetti because he ""didn't want the birthday girl to eat dessert alone"". Talk about impeccable service! The sorbetti was amazing btw...(not only because it was free).Left with a slight dent in my wallet but satisfied tummy so it was worth it!

This was like MAGIC!! They take the fish off the main bone take out any small bones and then tie it back in place. The result is whole roasted fish without all the mess that can be associated with it. Unfortunately the evening was not perfect. My wife had the Bistecca In Padella - - 28 Day Dry-Aged Sirloin Of Beef,  Bone Marrow Panzanella, Arugula, Capezzana Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The dish itself was prepared perfectly but that was one tough piece of meat. For fifty dollars I think it is fair to expect tender beef!The mixed roasted Mixed Roasted Mushrooms were sublime! Martini, Wine, double espresso, sambuca for me.   My wife had wine,  Cappucino, AmarettoSoup to nuts - $295.  I walked away very happy!",1,0,0,Robert B.,"Dingmans Ferry, PA",8,290,50

5.0,6/16/2014,"Ideal locale if you are in or around the Lincoln Center Theatre area and looking for a more upscale fine dining (without table clothes).We had a party on a Saturday afternoon and had a nice size portion of the floor level restaurant to ourselves.  Wait staff was excellent and very vigilant in making sure everyone had full glasses of whatever they were drinking.  When being served our plates, an army of waiters and waitresses would come to 1 table at a time and put everyone's plate down together so the whole table could eat without waiting, very rare to find that in the city.The quality of the food was also just as excellent, as we and an assortment of Hors d'oeuvres (salmon on toast, marinated grilled shrimp, spice tuna Carpaccio, arrancini and some others).The pastas were all al dente; we did the strozzapreti with lobster and ravioli a cacio e pepe.  For entrees, I would highly recommend the meat and branzino that were both excellent.And for dessert, the chef is UN-REAL, so see if you can get your hands on the homemade pistachio ice cream which will blow your mind.  All the other ice creams (chocolate, raspberry and some others were all dynamite).  If you have a party, I would HIGHLY recommend getting the cake done here, as you will receive the utmost quality and presentation no matter what the price is.Buon Appetito!",0,0,1,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263
4.0,5/11/2014,"Lincoln is like Per Se's little Italian step-brotherDimly lit, this elegant restaurant run by Chef Benno (former chef de cuisine at Per Se) serves sophisticated dishes and delicious open views at the Lincoln center / Juilliard area. Even though the restaurant was busy, we didnt feel crowded in our booth near the back of the restaurant. My family came for the Mother's Day dinner and were disappointed to find that many of the dishes we were hoping to order (squid ink pasta, duck, grilled prawn) were not on the actual menu. Lincoln warmed us up with a small fried mozzarella cheese brick, very light (oddly reminded me of egg tofu), but it was delicious and nicely set the mood for our dinner. My first dish of the four course meal was smoked salmon with sturgeon caviar. Premium grade smoked salmon sliced the perfect thickness with little bits of caviar, roasted grapes (who knew this could be so delicious?) and micro-greens decorating the plate, a fresh and tasty antipasti.The lobster casarecce was next with lobster tomalley mixed into the pasta dough. Really cool because the dough is actually green before cooking but turns a bright red color when cooked in the water. Nice acidity in this dish as well as chunks of flavorful lobster. I had a taste of the spaghetti with clams and it was delicious as well, flavorful broth with garlic infused fresh spaghetti and assorted tasty clams.Entree was OK, halibut with curry was in all honestly.. boring. Halibut was salted too heavily and the serving size was tiny. I had a taste of the King Salmon (excellently grilled) and Branzino (good) both of which I would recommend over the halibut.Dessert was nice, especially the ice cream that came with each plate; I decided on the setteveli and even though the cake itself was moderate, the hazelnut ice cream was incredible. I recommend the ricotta cheese cake if you want something lighter and not too sweet. Although the food was delicious overall, my experience wasn't as good as it could have been due to a few minor issues.. I would've liked it if I didn't have to remind the waitress to bring us bread (waited till right before entrees before we asked). Also the lady waiting our table (receipt said Jennifer) was not as friendly as some of the other staff such as the sommelier (super friendly and helpful) or the other waitress who eventually brought us the bread, made conversation, and apologized (it wasn't even her shift)Despite these minor issues, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Lincoln. Great atmosphere with intricate and delicious food made up for the minor mishaps. Will definitely return for new seasonal dishes by Chef Benno! Please bring back the Raviolo with Lobster and Chanterelles!!",5,3,2,Michael C.,"New York, NY",100,47,91

After ordering a nice bottle of Syrah, we went ahead and ordered one of their three course prefixe options. I started out with a simple Burrata which was delicious, then the Squid Ink pasta with sea urchin and crab which was GOOD, then the sheep's milk ricotta cheesecake which was also good.

4.0,4/29/2014,"I am not a fan of Italian cuisine. I don't like the overuse of the cheese and they pour too much olive oil into their dishes. However, this is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in NYC. As One Star Michelin restaurant, it does have certain good qualities. Beautiful decoration and high-end atmosphere. Great services and beautiful view. The taste of the food is extraordinary, and the chief is really talented. It is very difficult for Italian dishes to look fantastic due to the cooking procedure, but in this restaurant, the chief makes single dish looked like an art.I went to the restaurant at noon. I customized a third course lunch. Started with Anti-pasta, seafood (octopus, squid & shrimp)  with tomato source and crispy risotto cake. This dishes was amazing and the tomato source did not cover the fresh taste of seafood. My second dish was fried cheese ball (I forgot its italian name.) That was a mistake, and I did not like the combination of goat cheese and olive oil. My main dish was duck leg, which was fantastic and transcending. But the side dish was not good, and the turnip tasted really plain and soft.No matter what, this restaurant is worthy of the time and the money and it has been on the William's Selections.",0,0,0,Beide Z.,"Manhattan, NY",7,9,1

4.0,3/31/2014,"If a 5-star restaurant doesn't get high reviews, then there's something wrong with that. Of course this place has great food!! It's a upscale restaurant. It is where people go before a show at Lincoln Centre. Anyway, this place is kind of hard to find if you're already in the plaza. It's on 65th Street. There are two entrances, one on the plaza level and one on the street level.I don't go to these kinds of places at all, only with my boss. This was a nice leisure get together with my boss and colleagues. We did have tickets to a show so we had reservation at 5PM. There a few people already waiting to be seated. The hostess asked if we wanted our coat checked, we declined. (If you enter from the street entrance, you can get your coat checked to the right. I don't know if you have to pay.. probably do). At 5, we were seated to our table. It was a rounded booth that faces the bar and the open kitchen. It's really nice to see the open kitchen, if you're with people that aren't really talking, it's a nice ""entertainment"" section to see. I didn't really observe the decor and my surroundings so much, but everything was clean and transparent (as in clear and not much clutter). We were handed a cocktail/drink book and asked for water (bottled water served in a tall glass) We were all catching up and talking (because my boss travels and don't see her often). The waiter (who was French) handed us menus and was very nice (very heavy French accent). Anywho, after awhile he came back to get our order. I was a little frizzled as I was listening to the conversation and haven't actually decided to get. But I got the Strozzapreti con Aragosta, which basically is lobster, scallops and tarragon peas with pasta. We also got Antipasti for 4, but I don't know what it was called or if it's even on the menu. But it was like a fried dough and then there was thin slices of meat on top of it, with an AMAZING sauce. That sauce was delicious!! One of the best thing I've had. After we ordered, we got a choice of bread and Saffron arancini. And then the antipasti came shortly after. The Strozzapreti con Aragosta was nice. It had a little bit of a kick. Unfortunately, got a like a shrimp shell or something? Definitely something not edible. A little bit a of a disappointment. Onto dessert, we got three, Dolce alla Ricotta with sorbet (cheesecake), Tortino al Gianduja con Caramello al Pompelmo (chocolate cake with gelato), and Zuccotto (another chocolate cake with mint gelato). They all tasted good. My favorite out of the three was the chocolate cake with carmel and gelato. They're all a bit heavy but portioned out well so I wasn't extremely full. And I also got some coffee. Tasted great even w/o sugar and milk. At the end of your meal you get, three little small treats. This time, it was salted caramel, some white-looking chocolate and some truffle chocolate-type thing.On a side note, their bathroom is very nice and stylish with a wall as a mirror. Overall, it's a lovely restaurant. Don't count on getting full because it is portioned small, but delicious. Love to come again, when I'm making that money.",3,1,1,Elaine W.,"Queens, NY",85,195,310

4.0,3/10/2014,"My bf and I tried Lincoln for Valentine's Day last month. This recently received Michelin restaurant, a brainchild of Per Se's chef, Jonathan Benno had very much all the appeal for wonderful dining experience. So without hesitation we had booked reservations roughly a month out from Valentine's day weekend.So we get to the restaurant, check in our coats, plop down and are given menus. Strategically we chose to order directly from the main menu, even though a San Valentino tasting special was featured that night. We concluded that if we wanted to taste more dishes, the main menu would be the better option since two of the five V-day courses were to be shared by two guests.Risotto/Mozzarella Fried Balls were given to us as an Amuse Boche. They were aromatic yet very mild in flavor; what I really would have LOVED to do was dunk into some marinara sauce!Our bread options that night included Parmesan breadsticks, a sesame option that obviously I didn't care too much for since I didn't recall the style, and of course, the finest of three: a salt and pepper fluffy focaccia. I had no doubts I had picked the best of the three. It was heaven in carb form that I easily had seconds of. With our bread came extra virgin olive oil and a polenta-fennel purée spread; both applied generously after every bite of my bread.For our first course I chose ""Quaglia Allah Griglia con Farrotto"" or grilled quail, crispy pig's trotter, farro, broccoli purée, and arugula .  My other halfhad the ""Sanguinaccio con Polenta "" or blood sausage, grapes, polenta, and parmigiano reggiano. Both equally outstanding and a probably the best dishes of the night. Never have I had celery tie a dish together so well. The Sanguinaccio was the devil in a porridge form; absolutely sinful, with just enough little grapes to cut through the richness.As suggested by server, we had split a pasta dish for our second course, an Orecchiette made with smoked flour pasta, Florida shrimp, Scarlett runner beans, pork sausage and Calabrian chili. Very bold in flavor but 30 seconds under my personal liking for what I consider reasonable ""al dente."" What made this my second favorite was the overall robust flavor, with heat from the chilies that were strong and round, but never overpowering.For my meat dish I had decided to go with the Spanish Mackerel with jingle bell peppers, broccoli, grapes, and a red wine- black pepper glaze. The mackerel was delicious, but the portions were slightly bigger than what I was expecting, which was by no means a bad thing. My bf has the ""Bollitto Misto"", or Chicken leg presee, American wagyu beef tongue, cotechino sausage, lentils and black truffle. A trio of meats that he had concluded were great on their own, but not entirely cohesive together. I guess in order of sequence this was my least favorite dish, more so because I wasn't expecting that many peppers, and I was on the verge of full halfway having eaten the dish.But of course, we had plowed right along and commenced with dessert. I had decided on the ""Zuchotto"" which came with chocolate mousse, mint stracciatella gelato and a black and white Genovese. But before I was able to put a dent in my dessert, I was on the verge or ""hurtful"" full, which I haven't had ever since I had dined at Marea.The individually wrapped orange bitter caramels and nougat candy that were part of our Petit Fours were quickly stashed into my Chanel. With a few more sips of coffee I was more than ""stumbling"" full and ready to home. Overall I would say we had a very good meal at Lincoln, but we both agreed that the entire experience has somewhat fell flat after the pasta dish. Fresh, modern, slightly pretentious, with a dash of naive; it was rightfully rated at a one-star. But nothing that ruined our evening that's for sure.",1,0,0,Jennifer M.,"Montclair, NJ",786,835,3585

One of the hallmarks of any other Michelin restaurant I've visited is that when you experience a tasting menu, many of the courses just grab you and leave you wanting much more than a taste. That never happened here. The food was good, but not ""wow"". It's definitely not in the same class as others I've been to.The main course was the one that disappointed, I think. The three meats (chicken leg, beef tongue, and sausage) were all heavy and didn't complement each other well, and the reduction sauce just pulled it down. Really should consider taking one of those meats and focusing on it and keeping the entire dish less dark and complex.Dessert was great, but has been done better.

5.0,2/28/2014,"For the better part of a year, whenever I spoke of Lincoln, I felt as though my words fell into an unseen lacuna, never reaching their intended recipient. Praise was met with either bemusement or impassivity. Not the magnanimous sort to begin with, I took it as a lesson to let experience be the teacher of fools. I knew that in time, the extolment of the discerning would yield a mass critical enough that Lincoln would reach some apotheosis, figurative or actual. With its long overdue Michelin star bestowed at the tail end of last year, the moment seems to have arrived at last. In the interest of pre-empting reactionary eye rolling at my lending any weight to a collective of boobs that somehow decided Carbone was worthy of a star, I will say only this: Some undeserving restaurants are minted by Michelin in Michelin's own interest of staying relevant in the eyes of the novelty seeking masses. Lincoln is not one of them. It is fitting that Jonathan Benno's opus - visually bounded in as it is by that wondrously illusionary fountain cast through floor to ceiling windows - serves as a fluid but faithful reflection of himself and his evolved style of cooking. He has gleaned more than a modicum of the traits of his mentors: Marco Canora and Thomas Keller, but he has done so in a manner which has left him very much his own chef. The fanatical sourcing and attention to detail is of course present, as is the pervading paean to rustic Italian fare, but in the intertwining of each, Benno deftly inflects indelible traces of his own brash style. Take the bistecca. Dusted with what was surely dried porcini, a facsimile of dry aging, lending the meat and unanticipated but entirely appreciated funkiness, rendering the brittle crust and tender meat altogether more savory. It is not umami à la David Chang, caterwauled from rooftops and hashtagged on Twitter. It is incorporated with restraint, enjoyable rather than declaratory.  The tonno is likewise subtly subversive, defying preconceptions, evocative of the Mediterranean, a flavor profile sparse and simple; brininess from the olives, bitterness from the fennel, sweetness from the orange. The tuna itself seared with an abrupt kiss of the grill, the majority of the fish still raw enough to imagine it being pulled off the line by the chef himself moments prior. Those sorts of fanciful musings are commonplace at Lincoln, where the unobtrusive staff and stupefying architecture lull all but the most jaded into a blissful warmth.Normally, whatever state of enchantment drifted into ends with the arrival of the bill.This sort of sticker shock is prevented by both the reasonable (by Manhattan standards, particularly fine dining in Manhattan) pricing, and the remarkable (if a bit confusing) freedom offered by the prix fixe options. Two brunch courses of food at this caliber for $36 is a relative bargain. Three courses at dinner for $65 is equally enticing, especially in the consideration that you are given amuse and petits fours at either meal, and are allowed to choose from any area of the menu. Most prix fixe choices throughout the city are an afterthought, aimed at people rushing for a theater seating, or those who find a kale salad and grilled chicken breast immensely satisfying. The prix fixe at Lincoln feels almost...generous in comparison, and on its own merits. That is, perhaps, the highest praise you can give a restaurant. When you've so thoroughly enjoyed the experience that whatever sum you pay feels somehow inadequate. This sentiment struck home at every meal I had here. It is a rarity these days for meals to feel cherished. At Lincoln, it is the norm.",2,2,2,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672

The wine list was small for the aspirations of this place. That was ok for us as we were not looking for a huge drinking prior to theatre.

1.0,12/28/2013,I went here this weekend with my husband and another couple and we're big foodies living in Manhattan and we've eaten at 5 of the 7 three star Michelin restaurants in NYC. It's unfortunate that I have to say the food here was so bad we couldn't even eat it. I don't understand how on Earth they have such good reviews on Yelp so I felt compelled to write an honest review to warn others.The waitstaff was great and the decor is very nice but the food was awful. The lamb shank was so salty that I took one bite and threw away the rest for a $38 dish. The blood sausage pasta was undercooked so the pasta was hard and the sauce cloyingly sweet. The rest of the dishes tasted like it could have been served at The Olive Garden except extremely overpriced. The only dish we were able to eat was the eggplant parm side and that was just average. Please do not waste your money here. There are plenty of good restaurants around Lincoln Center.,3,0,0,Joan Z.,"Manhattan, NY",96,11,2

5.0,11/23/2013,"Lincoln Ristorante is a wonderful restaurant! My younger sister, mom and I came to visit New York for a week and a half and luckily came during restaurant week. From the first smiling attendant who greeted us at the door to the (very very very) tall and handsome garçon who took away our dessert plates, every member of the Lincoln team was charming and very good at what they do. We felt so welcomed and catered to! They even gave us a complimentary appetizer, slices of toast w/ chicken liver mousse sprinkled w/ pistachios, and a complimentary dessert, a homemade chocolate truffle. This was on top of the customary bread before the meal, which included a homemade pizza option (insanely delicious) and slices of rustic bread which came w/ a yummy eggplant/mustard puree and olive oil which came from some far away place that I can't remember :P Now the real stuff: our meal. We ordered from the restaurant week prix fixe option, which was $25 per person. Both of the appetizer options were fantastic! The salad was simple and refreshing (the marinade was top notch), and the tomato soup was very tasty according to my sister. My spaghetti w/ hake was oh so savory, and I suspect that the noodles were hand made in their kitchen. The tomato sauce was sooooo good I wanted to dip bread in it and eat it all up, which I would have done since they kept offering us more bread but I was so so so full. My sister and mom had the meatballs, which was a combination of veal, pork, and beef and they both said it was delicious! Very hefty portions. Ohhhhhh the dessert! The chocolate sponge w/ chestnut mousse was heaven in my mouth! I was so full already but I expanded my stomach as much as I could to finish this heavenly delight! Yum yum yum. It was also my sister's birthday so her rice pudding w/ raspberry sorbet & mixed berries came out with a cute happy birthday message written in chocolate and a candle! They were so sweet about it. The rice pudding tasted reminiscent of crème brulée and the mixed berries came with little wild strawberries! Overall, we had such a fantastic experience! This was our last meal out in NYC and it was a very sweet finish. The location is also beautiful with the MET opera house next door and the restaurant building itself has a green roof you can walk up and chill on! Would recommend this place 100%!

1.0,11/22/2013,"I've never written a review like this before but here goes. We were looking to have a cocktail before our opera which had a curtain call of 7pm, so needed to go somewhere close by since it was 6pm. Let's be clear that this means we would be leaving the restaurant no later than 6:30-6:40 at the very latest. We arrived and asked for a table for 2 and were told the bar area (admittedly small) was full. I noticed at least 20 empty tables and suggested one of those. The reply was ""they're all full, we have reservations for people coming in at 6:45 for curtain calls of 8pm"". Now there are 2 options here, the opera and the philharmonic. The opera started at 7 as already mentioned and yes, the philharmonic started at 8 BUT since we would gladly have vacated the table by 6:30 HAD WE BEEN GIVEN THE OPTION, I continue to be perplexed as to why this was not forthcoming. I am glad to have saved the $30+ that 2 drinks cost here if the place is staffed with people clearly not properly trained in the service industry. We are regular customers at their sister restaurant, THE GRAND TIER. I'm a native New Yorker and understand the need to keep tables for reservations BUT the offer of the ""settee"" at the entrance was HARDLY an option I was willing to consider let alone spend a fair amount on when I was surrounded by so many empty tables. I've been here before, the appetizers were fair and the drinks good. PITY I shall not be returning. We went to Avery Fischer Hall and had a drink at their nice lounge area and that was that.

4.0,11/4/2013,"KenScale: 8.0/10Lincoln Ristorante, situated in the Lincoln Center, is an Italian restaurant by chef Jonathan Benno (formerly of Per Se). Despite sky-high expectations based on the extravagant dining room and the pedigree of the chef, it hasn't quite lived up to such expectations among critics. I had a dinner there once last year, and wasn't particularly blown away either. Last week, I decided to give it one more try for Saturday brunch. The brunch course gives you an option to choose any two dishes (but not two secondi main dishes) for a pretty reasonable price of $36 per head. The restaurant features some dishes from particular Italian regions at any given time, and during my visit, it had menus from the northern Italian region of Piedmont. I started out with Verdure salad dish from the Piedmont region, a light dish that had fresh and crispy vegetables like radishes and artichokes but not particularly memorable. Salad was followed by two pasta dishes. I liked strozzapreti pasta (with scallop and lobster sausage) a lot, flavorful but not overdressed. On the other hand, cavatelli with broccoli spigarello was a tad too creamy to my taste. After the pastas came striped bass with butternut squash, fuji apples, walnut pesto, and brussels sprouts. The meat was tender, and worked very well with the pesto to create a delightful flavor. I ended the meal with sheep's milk ricotta cheesecake and concord grape sorbetto. This dessert was outstanding, with a great textural mix of the soft cheesecake and pumpkin seeds, along the refreshing touch of the sorbetto.The dining room during the brunch was fairly quiet and relaxing. Given the location of the restaurant, it tends to have an older crowd. Getting a reservation here doesn't seem like a huge challenge, especially during lunch/brunch hours. I wouldn't call Lincoln a destination dining place among many excellent Italian restaurants in the city, but if you're looking for a quick meal before or after watching a show at the Lincoln Center, the restaurant is a viable option.",4,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

4.0,10/31/2013,"Located by the Lincoln Center, the Lincoln Ristorante is an amazing restaurant. The venue is stunning to look at and I love that the kitchen is behind a glass wall so you can see everything that is going on (but don't smell everything, which is sometimes the situation if it's an open kitchen). Restrooms are downstairs and they have six separate unisex bathrooms which were quite nice. Service was absolutely superb for our dinner here and we had a wonderful time.We were a party of four and all decided to do the prix fixe. You get your choice of two savoury courses and one dessert for $60. Before we got to our main meal, we started off with a bottle of Riesling Kuenhof and received a complimentary Smoked Trout Appetizer as well as our choice of complimentary breads. I chose the foccacia and it was delicious. Lincoln Ristorante likes to choose a particular region of Italy and highlight particular dishes inspired by that region; I'm not sure how often they change the region but when we went they were focused on the Italian region once known as Enotria, rich in seafood, pork, chili, and spicy foods. For my prix fixe I got the following:AGNOLOTTI DI MAIS: Burgundy truffle, sweet corn, stracciatella-- I love ravioli and sweet corn so of course I greatly enjoyed this combination. The truffle shavings on top added a nice touch.PANCIA DI MAIALE: Glazed pork belly, Calabrian chili, fennel pollen, broccoli spigarello-- This was one of the highlighted dishes from the Enotria region. The pork belly was rich and sweet and so delicious. Loved it!SEMOLINA AL GRATIN: Macerated blueberries, Strega liqueur custard, fruitti di bosco sorbetto-- I had actually wanted to get a dessert wine, but they told me that doesn't count as a dessert. Our server suggested I get this dessert so that our table would end up with four different desserts. I did, but I did not like it very much. The dessert I ended up liking the most was DOLCE ALLA RICOTTA: Sheep's milk ricotta cheesecake, macerated strawberries, black pepper crema, strawberry sorbetto. Definitely recommend the cheesecake over the one I ordered.Even though we already had dessert, we were presented with complimentary truffles and candies at the end. They normally contain nuts, so our server brought a separate set of truffles and caramels for me. I absolutely adored our server, Justin--he was so polite, friendly, and helpful!

4.0,10/29/2013,"Apparently someone resurrected Frank Lloyd Wright and made him design a restaurant in Lincoln Center. The lines in the place are truly THAT stunning.And the food doesn't disappoint either.First, the wine list. A solid array of Italian. And one of the larger and fairer priced Amarone selections I've seen. Usually restaurants like these jack them up over two hundy to start.Next, the bread. LOVE the wonderfully salty focaccia, but be careful. You'll want to save room. I know, I sound like your mother...For apps, the burrata starter is just killer. So creamy you'll almost want to order another portion on the spot.The Parpadelle with truffles, however, was a bit of let down I have to say. Mostly because the portion is SO small and SO expensive. And while good, it's not as incredible as the price tag.The veal app is also a bit on the blah side. So I recommend sticking with the burrata.As for entrees, there is a spicy pasta that I stole a taste of, which was very good, but unfortunately I can't recall the name because I was too enraptured by my own main, the lamb shank.The lamb is fall off the bone moist, served over creamy polenta- need I say more? Plus, with the wine = heaven.Also, as a side, we shared the eggplant parm- and as good as some of the other things were, this might have been the best thing of the night. Masterfully prepared on every level. A contrast of textures from the soft, gooey middle to the crispy caramelized skin. So good. And yes, we still had room for dessert. And also yes, I could stand to show a little more self restraint. But the way I see it, if you're gonna eat at a place like this, go big or go home.So, back to dessert... the clear winner (we tried 3) was the pear tarte. Trust me, it's all you need to know.

5.0,10/28/2013,"Great place for a nice business lunch.  The restaurant is set to the side of Lincoln Center in a building with a sloping grass field on the roof.  Because the roof is sloped, the restaurant ceiling goes from low-to-high, with corresponding dark-to-bright lighting.  The area with the high ceiling has glass windows all around and is very bright--almost too bright on a sunny day, though they have pull-down shades.  Our party of four was going to be seated in the low-ceiling area but asked to be moved to the bright and airy side, and they obliged with no hesitation.The menu is Italian and it's very good.  We all had the $36 prix fix which includes 2 out of the 3 courses on the menu (Antipasti, Primi, Secondi).  Plus you can order dishes to share ala carte (Piccolo Piatti).  We all ordered the prix fix and got two Piccolo Piatti (eggplant parmigiana and roasted mushrooms) to share and it was more food than we could eat.  For my prix fix I had the Tortelloni di Zucca to start, which was pasta stuffed with cheese pumpkin and buffalo milk ricotta.  For my main course I had Uova al Pomodoro, which are basically 3 fried eggs in a tomato sauce.  Sounds basic but it was very well prepared and delicious.  Actually, it would be an excellent dish for brunch.Service was flawless throughout, and we all enjoyed ourselves.

I've experienced better"" + possibly insulted.We dined in the basement for the powerpoint lecture. For appetizer, I got Crudo di Trota, which was supposed to have the following ingredients: CITRUS CURED SEA TROUT, SMOKED TROUT ROE, RADISHES, CAPERS, WATERCRESS.I actually did not realize this during the meal since I was so focused on the lecture, but they left out the ROE! On the other hand, they DID give the speaker, who ordered the same dish, the roe.  My friend, who happened to sit next to the speaker noticed the roe and actually asked for some, because he did not have the roe on his plate either.A restaurant of this caliber should not discriminate its customers.  They really should have explained if the roe was unavailable, or only available to certain people.  I can't possibly think it was a mistake for them to not place the roes on 2 out of 3 plates from the same dinner table.  If it was so and they recognized it, why brought the extra fish eggs to only one customer?  Well, not astute of myself failing to detect the missing ingredient, but is it really the customer's job to make sure each dish has all the ingredients that it is supposed to have?Aside from the absence of fish eggs, the smoked trout itself was too fishy as was the cooked fish that my partner got for his main entree.To be fair, I really enjoyed my entree BISTECCA. Dessert CROSTATA DI PERA was decent.In general, the portions were generous.It was a free dinner for me, so some people may say, ""what's a big deal with a few little fish eggs?""  I was really excited about this dinner, but that little act of (possible) discrimination can really change the impression.  If they skimp out on fish eggs that could be so obvious, imagine what they could do behind your back?",1,0,0,OrangPop S.,"Manhattan, NY",6,18,1

4.0,9/24/2013,"What comes to mind when you think of brunch? Boisterous, boozy, long waits and mediocre eggs, perhaps to name a few? Let's flip the script on that. Enter Lincoln, the place to go when you want to have something refined and delicate all in a serene and beautiful setting; when you want the non-brunchiest of brunches. The minimalistic space is truly beautiful on a nice day, bright and open with floor to ceiling windows looking out to the pavilion at Lincoln Center. The brunch menu is unlike your average brunch menu, featuring a variety of antipasti, pastas and mains that are also on the dinner menu. The brunch menu is also a tremendous deal, offering 2 courses for $36, with the inclusion of an amuse bouche and petite fours at the end of the meal. I enjoyed the insalata al frutti di mare (cold seafood salad) to start, a light but very savory and briny plate of grilled squid, octopus with some watermelon, cucumber, basil and summer squash for texture and brightness. The lemon maionese smeared on the plate added some acidity and a kick of salty anchovy, which I had to consciously avoid haphazardly as to not overpower each bite. The bf went with the agnolotti con tartufo estivo with corn and summer truffles shaved table side. I was admittedly quite envious of his plate, the perfect agnolotti showcasing late summer corn and truffles with absolutely creamy and pillowy texture. I had the brodetto for my secondi, a regional seafood stew from Marche with littleneck clams, mussels, and prawn in a fennel and tomato broth. While I appreciated the lightness and clarity of the tomato broth, I found it to be a tad salty and some pieces of the seafood to be slightly overcooked. I do think that it was also a misstep on my part to order two seafood dishes, featuring almost the same ingredients. The bf had the pollo frito con cicorie miste, which was essentially boneless Tuscan fried chicken with a market salad of chicories on the side. The portion of the chicken was surprisingly substantial, but the juicy dark meat had good flavor and seasoning on the light breading. Props to Lincoln for also offering soy milk with their coffee. And while we passed on the enticing Prosecco bar on our first visit, the bf did enjoy a housemade citrus sparkling soda that was Mountain Dew-like. Service throughout our meal was also impeccable, attentive and proper without being overbearing. I would definitely come back for dinner, as their dinner menu is in fact bigger and quite reasonably priced.

1.0,8/12/2013,"7:30, 8:00, 8:30, 9:00 are available said OpenTable of what was once the most anticipated new restaurant in New York - yet I ignored. ""I think we are going to be surprised, I think this is actually going to be great,"" I told my date. We were surprised. It was not great. These are not good days at Lincoln Restaurant. Far has the famed Benno fallen from his 3 Michelin starred days.I once had a friend who was the 1997 Orange County sportsman of the year. The best football player we had ever seen. The prom king. Today he is a corrections officer, oft found at the local bar, overweight, presiding over his band of sad failures, shouting about what might have been. I suspect Mr. Benno would recognize him.Lincoln is the saddest restaurant I have ever been to, ghosts of ""what might have been"" dancing about, run by a staff that can only have been procured from the same correctional institution referenced above. I have not seen such a surly crew since my last visit to the Port Authority. Every question answered with a ""yeah,"" ""na,"" or ""I don't know."" They should consider painting over the glassed open kitchen, if only to hide the apathy so visible on the forlorn faces of every chef in the kitchen. Benno wasn't in ""but maybe was here this morning or yesterday"" said the hostess who did tell me I couldn't go any further when I attempted to take a look through the glass (remember when you gave tours of your kitchen?). I asked her about the background of the chef in charge, she didn't know, she was new. She sent over a manager. He didn't know either ""maybe the Carolinas?"" He promised to find out for me (he never did). When you open a $20 million restaurant that is panned by critics and empty during prime hours, you really should be there, every hour until you right the ship. The most frustrating thing about Lincoln is the impression they aren't even trying anymore, content to shovel poor banquet hall fare to unwitting tourists and the built-in clientele of Lincoln center. Gone were the simple pleasures of the restaurant's early days when, despite failing to achieve the greatness it's prices and pretensions were aiming for, you got the impression they were still trying-- no special Vermont butters nor chickpea prosecco cake offered (now just a thimble of supermarket-quality olive oil with bread - all cold). If you need any evidence that they were stung by the early critics' complaints about their prices (but apparently not about their awful food) and now trying to lure whoever they can off the street, the bored server said we probably should try the ""value meal""-$65 price fixed. Included was a crostini that would not have been out of place passed around at a political fundraiser (a lump of tasteless ricotta on top of stale bread the size if a half dollar). Next any antipasti, followed by a ""primo"" (spelled ""primi"" on other parts of the menu - do you think Keller ever had a typo?), a main and dessert. ""We are not that hungry, we would like to share"" we indicated, ""nope, not allowed"" grumbled the server who we wouldn't see again for 20 minutes. They ""did us a favor"" and let us order an additional $30 pasta and waived their no sharing policy. We started with swordfish crudo with ""summer"" corn and morels that chef Benno had been bragging about earlier in the week via Instagram. Perhaps it had been sitting out since he instagramed it 5 days earlier, because the flesh was no longer ruby red but pale grey and literally impossible to cut through with the knife provided (the instagram also included what looked to be a samurai sword, perhaps we should have been offered a similar instrument). The corn had all the summer sweetness of a can of Green Giant. The waiter picked up the half eaten fish and took it away. No one ever asked why two people left a single portion of crudo largely untouched - perhaps they already knew. Next was a lobster and shrimp sausage pasta with hot and sweet peppers. I am unable to report how this tasted because the hot peppers masked any other flavors. If there was lobster and shrimp you would never know. What you would know is that half of the pasta (supposedly their specialty) was mushy and overcooked, other parts literally ice cold. The fish course was a overcooked piece if halibut with and odd side sauce that seemed to consist only of mayonnaise. The exact same morel and corn accompaniment reappeared on the plate with the halibut (perhaps they saved the portion we sent back earlier?). Is this laziness? Cost cutting? Whatever it was, it certainly wasn't fresh or tasty. We never saw the same server twice and the cloyingly sweet chocolate Tartuffo was delivered by our third waiter of the night. We took two bites, we got our check, and we left (after a quick stop at the bathroom which was maintained to the standards of a highway rest stop).Chef Benno, there are plenty of mediocre and expensive restaurants in New York. Very few of them are run by people who know better. It's time to start over.",9,9,3,Adam K.,"Manhattan, NY",15,22,1

I started with the insalata di verdure estive, which was just okay. Thankfully, everything else that we had ordered turned out to be extremely good. I got the spaghettoni al pomodoro, which was delicious. We got sides of the mixed roasted mushrooms, the polenta, and the beets to share for the table. All 3 sides were excellent. I did try my boyfriend's agnolotti, which was not too heavy, though erred on the sweet side. I also had an amari cup cocktail, which was delicious.For dessert, we all shared the tortina d'albiocca e pistacchio and the dolce alla ricotta, which were both light and tasty. We also got some complimentary little chocolate and fruit and nut bon bons after the desserts. (They also had amuse bouches for the table, which was whipped chicken liver mousse on top of crostini. I didn't try it, but everybody else said that it was very good).All in all, a great dining experience. Apparently, it's pretty hard to get a reservation here, so if you see an opening and would like to dine here, I would strongly recommend you make that reservation!

2.0,6/19/2013,"My two friends and I, all having eaten at Lincoln over the past several years, have noticed a serious decline in the quality of the food as of late. The service is still perfection and no one can take away from the beauty of this establishment, but our last three  outings at Lincoln caused us to take this restaurant off our list. We dined at Lincoln last Saturday night. The wagyu beef on the prezzo fisso menu was chewy and lacked the buttery quality of wagyou beef. The pasta with peeky toe crab and sea urchin and sea beans was a gloppy soggy mess with no discernible crab or sea urchin. I had expected a clean tasting vibrant presentation with lovely fresh crab and sea urchin that tasted of the sea. What I got was a dish in what looked like a red sauce and the only discernible ingredient was the sea beans. Although I expect these ingredients may have been in the dish, it was as if all the ingredients were put through a blender with tomato and came out tasting like pasta with liverwurst. After the waiter described the special dessert, Zuppa inglese, described as lady fingers with custard and rum, what was served contained no ladyfingers, no rum, but a bland custard with some berries on top. The sheeps milk ricotta cheese cake  was a wedge  of dry cake lacking the creaminess of ricotta . The Tartufo turned out to be a cream puff, and not a good one at that. All of the desserts were less than disappointing. You may be wondering why we accepted such mediocrity. This was a birthday celebration and we did not want to turn the evening into a negative experience. Looking at what other diners had on their plates, it seemed they were faring no better. I should mention that the.

5.0,1/27/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and is a default choice for family gatherings. First off, the drinks are AMAZING. They are all a bit unusual but incredibly tasty. I'm partial to the prosecco with cassis and elderflower, or any of their gin concoctions. As for the food, I've been here a dozen times and everything has been delicious. My favorites are the pasta dishes. The Carbonara is to die for, though I've only seen it at lunch. Also great is the Amatriciana. As for sides, the mushrooms and brussel sprouts are both fantastic. In my experience, desserts are the weakest part of the meal. Though they give you a complimentary tray of candies so you may find you don't even need a dessert.I recommend requesting one of the booths in advance of your meal.

5.0,1/22/2013,"Favorite restaurant in all of NYC, here's why:Disclaimer - I could be writing in hyperbole because it was my birthday, but...BAR: It's a full bar with excellent selection of unique cocktails.  I tried two different champagne cocktails, and they don't get any better.  You can select your champagne, fruit, and liqueur to match your taste.  The beer selection is decent, and the wine and liquor selection is VAST.SERVICE: I have yet to see better servers and hosts than here.  They are very accommodating and graceful in all aspects. AMBIANCE: Romantic setting, plenty of space between tables, separate bar setting, fairly quiet even when full.  Did I mention you have a pretty view of Lincoln Center?  Also, the floor to ceiling glass is elegant, and the decor is spot on.  Candles are perfect lighting, and it is dark in the right ways.DINNER:  The presentation and taste were far above average, very artfully designed plates and perfectly portioned servings.  I really loved the soft-shell crab, and the gnocchi was very fresh.DESSERT: I would've had and enjoyed everything on their menu.  The chocolate is rich and decadent, and the pastries are yummy!RESTROOMS: yes, I have such great things to say that I am including the restrooms which are single stalled and there are between 5 and 10.  Super clean, too.NO CONS!  I love this place, and with a fatter wallet, would go more than once a year.TIP: win the lottery and dine here weekly",2,1,1,Clementine C.,"San Antonio, TX",178,617,122

2.0,1/21/2013,"For the first course, the restaurant had given up the Italian tradition and serving American selections for appetizers. We had two selections in the first course. PASTA E FAGIOLI, HEIRLOOM POLE BEANS, ITALINI, PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO BRODO. This soup was dull and come without flavor. Only the best food critic can taste the origins of the beans. The soup base was hardly from a good stock, or it shouldn't be. BARBAZZA SCOTTATA, FRIED PORK CHEEK, ESCAROLE, LENTILS. The creative part is the use of pork cheek to non-Aisan audience. Without the shocking factor to Asian diners, this dish was plain. There are other Asian cooking methods that bring out the chewing nature of this portion which can combine flavor and texture. Instead of learning these techniques, a plain fried way of preparation seems boring. Greens were fresh. For the second course, we also had two selections. STRANGOZZI ALLA SPOLETINA. MARINARA, CHILI, PECORINO. The strangozzi was served colder than lukewarm. Considering that we were the first group during lunch hours, this could be inexcusable. Aren't this dish supposed to be served warmer than body temperature? Or perhaps I need more classes. The marinara sauce was above average and the plate decoration was acceptable. TROTA COTTA ALL'OLIO. RAINBOW TROUT, RUSSET POTATOES, ONION, PARSLEY. This dish comes with the largest portion among all four mentioned here. It has very dainty cooking and did bring out the original dubious taste of a rainbow trout. This dish was enjoyable but didn't live up to the expectations. For the desert, TORTA DI PERUGIA, GIANDUJA MOUSSE, HAZELNUT GELATO was bright and sophisticated. The mousse went extremely smooth and charming. Gelato was suave and reminded us the autumn within hazelnuts. SERPENTONE DELLE MONACHE, DRIED FRUITS, NUTS, VANILLA CREMA. This sweet plate was playful and amusing. A very balanced combination placed an agreeable ending. For the farewell delight, we had TOZZETTI, ALMOND BISCOTTI. This biscotti surprising live up to the anticipation that was enticed from the scenery outside of the glass wall. It has Italy in it.LINCOLN ""BACI"", CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT TRUFFLE.

5.0,1/1/2013,"Nothing but positive things to say about Lincoln. I was here twice, most recently a couple of days before Christmas. For starters, I have to say how impressed I was with our server. Very professional, he not only knew the menu inside and out, but when asked how something was prepared, it was as if he was going back to the kitchen to cook it himself. Extremely detailed and well versed with respect to Lincoln's dishes. As for the food, I ordered the foie gras, sweet potato casonsei (basically ravioli) and the bistecca, followed up by the bonet for dessert. I found this menu a bit difficult to navigate, not because of anything overly complicated on it but more so because there were so many dishes that I really wanted to try. That said, I won't push for you to try any of these delectable delights because I don't think you could really go wrong with other choices.

We were lucky to see our meals plated. I did the $60 three course meal. For my starter I had the linquine with peeky toe crab and sea urchin. It was fresh and delicious. Following the linquine, I had the Bistecca which is Lincoln's version of a sirloin steak. The meat was perfectly cooked and the sauce was divine. It was easily one of the best steak's I've had in a while.They have quite an extensive collection of desserts for all the sweet-tooths out there.

5.0,12/20/2012,"Lincoln delivers the finest level of food and service at such a reasonable price that you'll be left wondering what it is that you're really paying for mostly anywhere else, at any level of the spectrum. A tremendous waitstaff of friendly experts will walk you through your meal, be it lunch or dinner, and make sure that everyone's experience is top notch. Plates are delivered and cleared simultaneously, and a captain will always be on hand to remind everyone of what their dishes are and how excellent of a course they are about to have.It's not often that I'd write about the bread selection, but to start off your meal - and to mop up your leftover sauce after every course - you have to try the focaccia bread.  Cooked with a magical ingredient, duck fat, this is absolutely spectacular bread. It amplifies the flavor of everything you dip it in or pour on it.The best way to approach a meal here is to take up the offer for a prix fixe meal. Offering two courses at lunch and three at dinner, it really is a wonderful deal and allows you to explore the menu as a table. Most dishes are suitable for sharing a bite here or there, so plan a bit and expect to taste a bite of nearly everything ordered among your party.  At dinner time the carne cruda is a must, as is lamb shank. At lunchtime the parpadelle with veal and mushroom is a fabulous starter, and the cacciucco - monk fish with mussels clams and shrimp - is an option made to have the focaccia dipped in it.Dessert is as impressive as the rest of the meal leading up to it. Homemade gelato and sorbets accompany the other desserts on the menu beautifully, with exotic and fun flavor selections that will rival anything you've had from a traditional creamery. Sheep's milk ricotta gelato and Quince sorbet were among my favorites. At dinner time, a special Gorgonzola cheese cake was both stimulating and fascinating. The wine and liquor menu is very extensive here as well. Ask for help pairing a beverage at any point of the meal.I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough.

5.0,12/17/2012,"RUN DON'T WALK-Lincoln Ristorante is my favorite discovery.  Heard about this place from ""Bernie""-a regular at 11 Madison.  I figured he would know the Manhattan restaurant scene (Bernie's about 90 years old, been dining out forever).  Lincoln did not disappoint.  My friend and I walked in without a reservation, so we thought we'd sit at the bar.  Seriously, by 5:30 the entire bar area was FULL of walk-ins planning to have dinner.  The maitre d' offered us a table that he would need back by 7.  Bummed, but without a choice, we said yes.  First, Justin (as I have seen mentioned in other reviews) is fantastic.  He knew we were under their time constraint so he was efficient without making us feel rushed.  He knew the menu and the appropriate wine pairings-outside of our first drink, we left everything up to him and the pairings were PERFECT!  We opted for the prix fixe, superb deal.  I saw a few people complaining about the prices-my guess is they don't get out often to high end restaurants because this place is an absolute bargain for what you get.  Often, prix fixe portions are smaller and the choices are very limited. Outside of the white truffles, the entire menu is available to you.  And the portions are healthy.    We started with the linguini & peeky toe crab-as my friend observed, it was the first time we have seen crab used as a flavoring.  Often you see chunks of crab in dishes, but you don't really ""taste"" it throughout the dish.  This is not to imply they were skimpy on the crab, on the contrary, they were generous without clobbering you over the head.  I had the steak tartare on watercress.  Hands down the best I have ever had.  The wagyu was perfectly hand cut and the flavor was fantastic.  Next course was seared sea scallops with pork belly and lentil.  Again, perfect combination of flavors.  Scallops seared perfectly.  My friend had the Cacciuccio (monkfish seafood stew), which was very good.  However, it wasn't fair to judge it next to the scallops.  Dessert was gorgonzola and ricotta cheesecake-I don't even like cheesecake, but this was fabulous.  Light and airy, and the gorgonzola added just the right amount of savory to keep it interesting.  The pear crostata was yummy, but we both preferred the cheesecake (again, not fair to judge it next to the cheesecake).I can not wait to go back here.",2,0,1,Tina H.,"Brentwood, CA",103,32,3
4.0,12/16/2012,"There have been many good restaurants I've visited that I haven't spent the effort to write about. Usually it's because I feel that nothing I might think to write would contribute anything to the chorus of opinions already readily available, on Yelp and elsewhere.For most of my pre-theater dinner there, I thought Lincoln would fall into this category. This is not, in itself, a criticism: I've also failed to Yelp-review Babbo, Scarpetta, and Ciano, to name a few other stellar pasta-slingers in this town. And yes, I verily enjoyed my beef tongue salad, with its horseradish-infused beets and the thin lengthwise slices of muscle that did nothing to hide the fact that they were, indeed, tongue. And the whole-wheat fettucine -- which I'd ordered almost on a self-dare -- was gorgeously cooked, with the glistening smoked trout making up for a slightly overly mustarded sauce. Good bread service. Nice amuse-bouche. Blahblah.Forget all that. The point of this review is not to offer an all-encompassing opinion. It's for this public-service announcement: my dessert at Lincoln was the most incredible restaurant dessert I've had in the nearly four years since I moved back to New York.Hyperbole? Perhaps. But that jaw-dropping crostata... Caramelized pear slices, yielding without losing their body, sweet without being cloying. A creme fraiche cake base, warm like a lover's pillow and almost as soft on the inside, but ringed by a delightfully crisp crust. A dollop of crema custard on the side, with the subtle, unassuming depth of a fine viola.And atop all, a quenelle of mille fiore-fennel pollen gelato that triggered pure blasphemy in me: for a feverish moment, I wondered, ""Why bother going back to Florence?"" It held its form in the mouth for but a flash, just long enough to make you yearn for it in retrospect after it flared out into a puff of licorice-tinged vapor, like a collision in a particle accelerator. Even then, the ensuing decay managed to release further notes of fields, of moonlight, of all those things insufferable oenophiles go on and on about but here was the real thing, delivered in a vehicle of unbelievably luscious smoothness, an ice queen whose embrace you'd welcome with all your heart, even as your blood was chilled into oblivion...I came to my senses quickly, of course: putting down gelato in Italy is like criticizing sushi in Japan. Such experiences are unduplicatable. But Lincoln brought its own brand of ineffable wonder to that single spectacular plate and, in doing so, changed my entite calculus for dining around Lincoln Center. Where previously I had seen a rather expensive, coldly pretty restaurant, now I saw a place where to NOT drop by for a quick sweet bite would seem a crime.That particular crostata probably won't be on the menu for long -- the food choices at Lincoln change relatively quickly, across the board. But the technique and balance required to make such a dessert, that will remain. Besides, I'd eat a gallon of gelato with that texture even if it were... I don't know... stuffing-flavored.Probability of return within 1 year: 100%",5,2,8,Lawrence C.,"New York, NY",82,215,0

I enjoyed the prix fixe (the waitress referred to this as the pre-fee... you have to laugh!) which for me was the ventresca di tonna alla verbicarese.  This dish is definitely a meal in and of itself, so if you can share, you should.  It was flavored fantastically and the fish was cooked perfectly.  My date and I then shared the gnocchi alla fonduta alba white truffles.  White Truffles!!  Small plate, but totally worth it for all the flavor!!  Finally, I had the anatra arrosto.  If you're a fan of duck, this is your dream plate.  The breast and leg were absolutely delicious!  Dessert consisted of coffee and a type of flan that I did not enjoy, but as I'm not a fan of desserts, you really can't go by what I say.  The coffee was superb, and I appreciated my own personal coffee pot. I'd give a 5/5, but every restaurant can use improvement.  I think the portion sizes could use adjustment... maybe slightly smaller for the antipasti and a little larger for the primi.",0,0,0,Jenny G.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,35,3
5.0,11/12/2012,"Date night and we were dressed up Bond style, looking for somewhere suitably classy to eat after watching the Skyfall premiere last Friday at Lincoln Square. The Lincoln came highly recommended on our Yelp search of restaurants in the area, so I reserved a table with a little trepidation, never even having heard of it.Even approaching from outside, I knew I had made the right choice - the entrance is up a flight of stairs from 65th St and that wedge of glass makes a dramatic statement.We were greeted warmly by the hosts and our coats taken. We started off with cocktails - vodka martini (shaken, not stirred) for him and a Francesco de Pinedo for me. Both were poured at our table and were perfect - dangerously smooth and easy to drink! Our waiter, Justin, was fantastic. He helped us choose our food and wine. It was as if he couldn't do enough to ensure that we were happy with every single element of our meal. To start, we decided to share the grilled octopus starter and side of shishito peppers. They thoughtfully brought the octopus on two plates so there was no leaning across the table or awkward ""you have the last bite, no you...""  The peppers were many and very hot. Unless you reeaaally love these, share them as it is a very generous portion. I think we were unlucky to get a particularly potent batch as they slightly destroyed our taste buds for the next course!  I also just suddenly remembered that before the starters, they brought an amuse bouche of crostini topped with a dollop of something delectable but the ingredients escape me now. We both had pasta dishes which were delicious and perfectly cooked. What impressed us most about this meal, which we have not experienced before in NY, was that as well as our shared starter coming in separate plates, Justin suggested we share glasses of wine in separate glasses, so we could try a variety of different kinds with our various dishes without spending a fortune and getting completely wasted in the process!  Also, he made us feel very comfortable about changing wines if we didn't like them - he just wanted us to enjoy our choices, which we so appreciated.We were too full/tipsy for dessert, but our coffee came with a selection of petit fours, all of which were delicious and finished the meal off perfectly.Thanks to a beautiful setting and the brilliant Justin, we had a wonderful experience that we hope to repeat next time we are all dressed up in the Lincoln area!",7,0,1,Betsy S.,"Marblehead, MA",11,30,3

My uncle's steak was supposed to be medium, and it ended up being well-done at the ends and at best medium-well in the center; the resulting meat was very tough and dry.

The pork chop with kale and white bean was very juicy. We took our kids there for a special occasion and they treated them really well! The trio of ice cream could be a meal of its own and the macerated blueberries with a creme brûlée was delicious. Excellent wine list. Excellent atmosphere.

5.0,9/9/2012,"I came back here and sat outside, on a warm rainy night under cover of the restaurant's overhanging roof.  Rain drops falling in Lincoln Center's fountains--it was darn pleasant.  Like before, service was perfect, ditto the drinks and food.  That makes 3 visits here--once for brunch, once for the bar, once for a late dinner--and zero complaints, only good things to say.  This place is expensive, but worth it.",0,1,1,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",414,641,407
5.0,8/20/2012,"I can't say enough good things about the Lincoln. My family went here for my birthday and we felt like royalty. The staff was super nice and even though multiple waiters brought out each dish, you never knew it-they were quick and subtle about it. The antipasto were incredible and even the house made bread was very tasty. Their wine list selection is top notch and very obviously selected by an expert. We were even impressed at the selection of unique beers available. The special of the night was a branzino to be shared which was out of this world and my brother had a steak that had one of the most unique tastes we've ever tried. My pasta was out of this world with a combination of pork, beef and veal that melted in your mouse with the hints of pecorino cheese. To top it off, the two desserts we ordered with a custom birthday message were superb. The Lincoln was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've ever had. I highly recommend for family or dates. The setting and ambiance can't be beat and quite frankly, I did not find the prices offensive and in some cases very reasonable-even the wine list.

5.0,8/11/2012,"What a fantastic experience! The service was beyond 5-stars, and our server was knowledgeable with spot-on food/wine suggestions.I gave the food 4 stars only because it seemed to be over-salted. Each dish was exquisite, considering the saltiness, and would be even better if the other ingredients were allowed to shine through without competing with salt.People balk about the prices, but these portions are ginormous, folks. Go. Eat. Spend. Indulge. Enjoy. It's ultimately awesome bang for your buck.The ambiance and interior design were also beyond 5-stars.

5.0,8/6/2012,"Wow, great experience at Lincoln.First of all, it's a beautiful space.  The open kitchen concept gives this restaurant a unique feel.  And there's a grassy area on top of the restaurant where you can sit and soak up some sun!  I also like that the restaurant sources local ingredients. Service - very friendly and helpful.  Our waitress was very informative and offered suggestions when asked.  The servers were also great, all crumbs were removed and water was refilled throughout our meal.Burrata - delicious mozzarella on top of tomato soaked croutons, locally grown tomatoes, olives, onions, and delicious white balsamic.  We tried to get each element in every bite because it was so delicious when put together.  The white balsamic was some of the best I've ever had, not too strong and delicious.    Mixed roasted mushrooms - wow, wow, wow.  Even though the mushrooms were too salty, this side dish was delicious.  There was a nice mix of different mushrooms that were cooked (I think roasted) perfectly.   I couldn't believe how much flavor was packed into each mushroom.Jaimin S. and I split the Spaghetti and Agnolotti which came out in a cute dish with 2 compartments.  First time I've seen this at a restaurant and I loved it .  I really wish I had a pair at home!Spaghetti - We couldn't help but compare this to the spaghetti at Scarpetta since it's our fave.   The verdict: Scarpetta still wins, but this was very close!  This dish was unique because of the delicious Parmesan on top and the lemon/lime (couldn't tell) which gave it a nice punch.  The pasta was a little too al dente for our taste.  Agnolotti - seriously, this was delicious.  Little pockets filled with buttery polenta with truffles and corn.  I was afraid the corn would make this dish too sweet, but it didn't!  The corn was refreshing and the polenta was divine.  Cheesecake dessert - we went back and forth about what to order for dessert and finally decided on the cheesecake after one of the servers said it was light and his favorite.  It did not disappoint!  It was light and fluffy with a great crust,  sweet strawberries, and a scoop of mouth watering strawberry sorbet.  I had mentioned on Opentable we were coming for my hubbie's 30th and they remembered!  Our dessert came out with a candle on the side and chocolate Happy Birthday writing on the plate.  I appreciated the attention to detail on this!We ended our meal with a complimentary small plate of sweet goodies including some biscotti, candy, chocolate, and little cake piece with strawberry filling (my fave) .  Everything was excellent!

5.0,8/1/2012,"Just a quick update - almost a year later, and about 6 visits later, it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in New York.  I've read through quite a bit of the reviews, and am a bit shocked at complaints on the price.  While most agree that the service and food are 5-star worthy (as do I, obviously), there is a complaint on the price.I challenge any of those reviewers to find a restaurant of this quality that is anywhere near the price point provided - they can't.  Every time I leave Lincoln (generally after a prix fixe and meat supplement - I'm Texan, what do you want from me), I feel like something is missing from the bill, or there's a surcharge or something that they neglected to include.  This place is one of the best values for the quality of food you will be getting - Go. Go Go.Also, take a date for dinner. Win at life.  Seriously. Win - done - over.  The place STILL strikes me as stunning, and I'd consider myself a semi-regular.  Recently had the rigatoni all'amatriciana as a primo, the bistecca (mid-rare, please) as a secondo, and the dolce alla ricotta per un dolce.

Each time the service was spot on and the food scrumptious. From the selection of bread (homemade bread sticks, foccacia, whole wheat and regular Italian bread). The funny thing is that you can have 1 or all of them. That's a nice touch...being stingy on the bread is a omen.This restaurant hits on all levels -- service, food and atmosphere.

4.0,7/10/2012,"The white glove experience at Lincoln hit just the right notes as the venue for my post-graduation family lunch. We went with the $32 option and had difficulty picking between all the choices - antipasti, paste, secondi, piccoli piatti! We loved the plentiful options and flexibility. Between the 6 of us, we tried the asparagi bianchi (white asparagus), cacciucco (scallop, shrimp, clams, mussels broth), the atlantic sea bream, and a few orders of the mixed roasted mushrooms. Everything was spot on, but the mushrooms were really the most aromatic, savory, and belly-warming. Multiple comments were made on how that would most definitely make it on the order on the next visit. The formality of presentation was a little over the top as hordes of servers tended to us, but it was all in good fun. Food was rich, which compensated for minute portions. Great for special occasions, will try the popular prosecco bar with friends in the near future.

4.0,6/25/2012,"I went to Lincoln Ristorante yesterday afternoon for brunch with three of my friends.The place wasn't particularly busy or full, so we had our choice of sitting indoors or outdoors. It was a beautiful day out, and we requested a table in the shade outside.We were promptly seated, served water, given menus, and shown an assortment of bread to try. When one of my friends couldn't decide what kind of bread she wanted, the waiter graciously said, ""Why choose? You can try them all!"" And try them all she did. The pizza focaccia seemed to be a big hit.For an appetizer, I ordered the Insalata di Pollo (chicken salad). The chicken mash was amazing! All of my friends tried it and agreed that it was pretty good. The gorgonzola was a bit strong, and I'm personally not a fan, but it was easily removed from the plate. I would give this dish four stars.Two of us had ordered the salmon for Secondi (recommended by the waiter), and minutes later, he came back out, apologizing that they only had one more piece of salmon - if we were both intent on fish, the salmon was going to be replaced with a halibut dish. I had actually initially chosen another secondi and changed my choice based on the waiter's recommendation, so I told them that I would order the Cacciucco instead. I wasn't disappointed with the Cacciucco, but I'm not a huge fan of when restaurants run out of their recommended ingredients.Anyway, like I said, I wasn't disappointed with the Cacciucco. It was pretty good. Slightly salty. And I had been expecting more soup and more seafood. But all in all, not bad. Three stars. Average. Nothing to write home about.(A Secondi that I would like to try, though, is the Uova al Pomodoro. One of my friends ordered it, and it looked AMAZING!!)Dessert was fantastic. I ordered the Neapolitan Gelati, and it was an insane mix of blueberries, green tea?, and something else. I don't remember the description, but I do remember how phenomenal it was. And on the bottom of the scoop of gelati were these little crumbles, which tasted like shortbread crumbles or something like that. Five stars!(Noteworthy: one of my friends had ordered the Torta di Fragole e Cioccolato and was less than pleased.)And we were then presented with a plate of petits fours. Nice touch at the end of the meal.Good food and great service made for a positive outside brunch in Lincoln Center. Thanks Lincoln Ristorante!",1,0,0,Michelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,78,10

I didn't have much time unfortunately, so I told the waiter when I had to be back at the office, and he and the rest of the staff did everything to accommodate me - they even gave me dessert to go! The service was absolutely excellent. The food was VERY good, too - I had the clam pasta (without pancetta) and the seafood stew. Both were delicious. I had the raspberry cake with kind of a flan-like pudding on top - it was pretty delish, but nothing amazing. If I were to go again, I would probably get wine instead of dessert.

The cocktails are quality as is the food. I was particularly impressed with the pasta - perfect al dente and the octopus app was also delicious. Prices are definitely on the higher side however.

1.0,5/27/2012,"I haven't been this upset ever in a restaurant, especially one that is a bit more ""high-end"".  I decided to try this restaurant for my birthday and made a reservation for 6.  We sat down at the upper level by the door and were neglected a menu for the first 5 minutes.  After ordering our food, I felt a burning tingle on my knees (I was wearing a dress and so were a few of my friends).  It started to swell up a bit and because I normally get a swelling/allergic reaction to mosquitos, I didn't think much of it and continued with dinner.  The food was bland, and we had to ask for salt and pepper.  I'm a chef myself and was really disappointed with the food.  About 30 minutes into dinner, I looked down on my legs and found about 6 more bites.  I started to panic, my friend mentioned something to a waiter but he didn't seem to care.  After another 5 minutes, I had red bumps all over my ankles, calves, and around my knees... BOTH LEGS!!!!  I didn't know what was wrong or didn't expect the bites to continue to happen.  I was then approached by another waiter only to be accused I had got these ""mosquito bites"" from outside the restaurant and there are ""no mosquitos in this restaurant, only one of our doors are open.""  I felt that the restaurant was being very irresponsible and blatantly rude for denying the fact that I was indeed being bit but a mob of insects (perhaps beg bugs??).  Especially since two of my friends were also getting bug bites.  The carpet around the table looks dirty and probably carried some sort of bug that bit me.  My friend sitting next to me was also bitten 4 times on her right leg.  We quickly rushed to dessert and got the check.  I left the restaurant realizing I had been bitten in a total of 11 times all over both legs.  This is the worst, and most traumatizing dinning experience I've ever had.  I sincerely hope (since the restaurant doesn't admit to this issue) that everyone who reads this please take caution and avoid this irresponsible, unsanitary, heartless restaurant.",1,1,1,Anna Y.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",1,5,3

3.0,5/7/2012,"This review is based on our brunch experience on a recent Saturday. Even though we just live a few blocks away from Lincoln, I don't think we will be going there any time soon, except for taking out of town visitors (for the view) or parents (who prefer spacious seating).We went there for their $32 two-course brunch prix fixe. Maybe the main chef was not in the kitchen for the brunch hours, maybe I was just unlucky that day, the two courses that I ordered were both disappointing. My first course was SPAGHETTONI ALLA CARBONARA. I always like to order this pasta dish when I go to a new Italian restaurant -- to see if they can do such a simple but difficult dish right. To my surprise, I couldn't see any tiny trace of egg in Lincoln's SPAGHETTONI ALLA CARBONARA. The pancetta was not the usual crispy type, but very bland and soggy (apparently it was not browned at all). All the pasta was soaked in a puddle of watery cream sauce. I don't remember ever eating any CARBONARA (either in NYC or in Rome) in watery cream sauce SANS eggs. Well, maybe the chef wanted to be innovative about a traditional dish, but too bad that it didn't work.My second course was pork belly. Before I ordered, I'd asked the waiter how ""fat"" the pork belly would be. He told me the fat and meat ratio was about half and half. But the fat: meat ratio of the pork belly I got was 3:1. Well, I had finished the whole pork belly before if it was prepared nicely, such as crispy kin and silky fat and rich flavor. But I didn't find any of those in my dish served at Lincoln. My husband ordered the cauliflower salad and seafood stew. The portion of salad was huge, but the vinaigrette dressing has too much acidity. He also complained that the seafood stew was too salty.We shared an order of Cappuccino chocolate cake. It was okay. Each of us ordered a Macchiato. It was served in a tiny cup with a lid. That was a nice touch.The service was good, but also very aloof. Even though it was a sunny day with a full house of people, this place still seemed very cold to me. To sum up, this is the place to go if you want the stuck up side of ambiance and service of quasi fine dining. Anyway, based on my personal experience, for Italian food, I definitely prefer Maialino, which served better food in a more vibrant setting. Or even the hole in the wall Celeste satisfied my palate better. For two-course prix fixe in the Upper West Side, I will definitely still go to Telepan (also $32 for two courses).",0,0,0,Tina Y.,"New York, NY",0,196,0

3.0,2/25/2012,"Before a recent Met opera performance, my friend and I stopped by Lincoln Ristorante.  I had read mixed reviews of it when it first opened, but we couldn't beat the convenient location, so we decided to try it out, plus I was intrigued by the bellini and negroni bars I saw on their on-line menu.  The space is a gorgeous mix of glass and gleaming wood and I love the open kitchen design (safely tucked behind a wall of glass to reduce noise but keep the view).  Since we didn't have reservations, we took seats at the bar.  I don't want to call the women who served us a ""bartender"" since that doesn't do justice to how helpful, attentive, and friendly she was.  I'm a gin fan and was interested in trying something from the negroni bar.  She asked me a couple of questions to narrow down my likes and dislikes and then picked the combination of Plymouth, Aperol, and Carpano Antica.  It was fantastic and I don't know how I have not been drinking negronis for years!  For my non-gin drinking friend, she went with Blood Orange Vodka, Cardamaro, and Carpano Antica.  Also a hit.  I would have happily sipped my drink and nibbled on the addictive crispy toasts made from pork lardo focaccia sprinked with parmesan cheese and chili oil until curtain time, but we did want to have some dinner too.  For amuse bouche, we were served piping hot arancini- delicious!- and then a selection of house bread (the pork lardo focaccia, italian, etc) with an eggplant spread  For the main course, I had the ravioli d'agnello (lamb ravioli) tossed in a butter sauce with citrus gremolata and kale and my friend had the reginette verdi al ragu bolognese.  The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is because I don't think we tried enough dishes to give that rating.  But I thoroughly enjoyed the entire evening and I look forward to checking back in for a full meal and 4 stars.",1,0,1,Susan W.,"Manhattan, NY",5,14,0

Our waiter, Justin, was charming, polished and attentive.Their extensive wine list includes a Prosecco Bar. I chose the 'Bigaro' E. Perrone Brachetto-Moscato 2011 with Peach Puree and Fragoli Toschi Wild Strawberry Liquore. Absolutely delicious! I've always thought it best to start with dessert. ;)The Gnudi Di Ricotta e Rapini (Ricotta Dumplings) is a very rich dish to share and the Cappellini Ai Gamberi (Shrimp Scampi) is excellent. I also tried a bit of the Bigoli Veneti Alla Peverada (Duck Ragu.)  I would suggest ordering numerous small dishes.The Affogato dessert was heavenly and the house-made donuts are a perfect complement.

4.0,2/16/2012,"Interior Design - 5 starsService - 5 starsFood - 3.5 starsRomantic dining experience - 5 starsWent to Lincoln for Valentines day & yes it was a very special dining experience.  The wait service was impeccable.  Being a foodie, I just love the open kitchen and most of the dishes were great.  The octopus appetizer, eggplant side & dessert were all flawless. My only criticism is that the sauces on the entrees were overly salty.  The duck au jus on a bed of farro was cooked perfectly, but had to avoid the sauce & couldn't eat the farro due to it being too salty.  This dish came highly recommended & and at $37 perhaps I should have returned it.  Our other entree of the diver scallops was also a little salty, but not as much as the duck.The thyme infused gelato was to die for - wish I could buy a pint.  But, the coffee was not so good.  I just hate that I can go to a fantastic restaurant and can't end the meal with a equally good cup of coffee.  Why do so many chefs overlook or ignore this element of the meal.  The waiter told me it was a specially prepared blend of Brazil and Ethiopia roasted by Dallis Brothers.  It was roasted on the darker side in a viennese style so it had roasty & smokey notes that dominated & overpowered any fruit or floral notes that would have come from the Ethiopian.  As it cooled it started becoming harsh which would suggest to me that it is a lower quality Brazilian bean.  This is essential comparable to the chef at Lincoln using a low quality fillet mignon and cooking it well done with charred surfaces.  I don't think they would do that, but why is it okay for the coffee???Okay, enough ranting.  All-in-all, it was a great dining experience & I would happily go back.  Just ask for light salt & skip the coffee.",0,0,0,Vincent R.,"Annapolis, MD",44,11,5

4.0,2/9/2012,"Don't get me wrong, the food was good but it paled in light of the experience. My son who lives on the UWS chose the Lincoln for his birthday dinner. The setting is spectacular with walls of glass allowing breathtaking views of the Lincoln Center Plaza and reflecting pool, VERY NY. The night lighting is phenomenal and gives a romantic movie-set feel. There are other great seating options if you're not into movies. You can sit watching your food being prepared in the kitchen or in one of a number of private booths. Once seated, our waitress asked if we had any food allergies, very thoughtful. ( I haven't heard that question since my last physical.)  Then she continued to be a knowledgeable guide through the menu and extensive wine list.  Service was excellent.    To begin, our group really took advantage of the Prosecco Bar customizing sparkling wine choices with different fruit purees and a variety of interesting liquors. We collectively had lots of fish, Bream, Snapper, Flounder and Shrimp, all good. What stood out were the brussel spouts with pancetta, pasta generously garnished with truffles, riso gelati and almond sorbetto. The pear salad with marinated endive, I think. would have been improved without so much of that gelatinous ingredient. After dinner, the chef provided complimentary mini tarts and cookies, a nice touch.

2.0,1/25/2012,"Despite professional service, hip decor, and great architecture, Lincoln Ristorante suffers somewhat from a lack of culinary focus.  The dishes we had were well constructed, but lacking in that passion I'd have expected.  The rolled chicken (not sure what it was) had different color chicken inside, including pink, which made me nervous. The ""high end"" steak and eggs was tasty and cooked properly, and made for a decent, if somewhat strange, lunch.  The snapper with saffron was too thin, and the skin on it overpowered the dish.  They should remove the skin on such a thin piece. The ricotta gnocchi appetizer was superb; perfectly made pillows filled with ricotta; I would have preferred that as a full dish, frankly.  The squid ink pasta was one of the better choices, but again it could have been so much better.  The high point?  An amazing bloody Mary.  Overall, this is neat little place, but not much in the way of a culinary experience.",0,0,0,Alex G.,"Portland, ME",44,1022,383

I want to share this since I think it will help to defend why I would recommend this place.First, as I said, we didn't have a reservation. It was Friday, we had talked of having dinner here but had not planned anything. We were in the area and wanted to see if any seats would open up at the bar. While we waited, they invited us to sit at a table by the door and order something; We selected our drinks and from the minute they served us couldn't have been nicer. Anyway, as is the case for restaurants near the Lincoln Center, someone canceled a dinner reservation and we were sat shortly after. We had already looked at the menu and we ordered right away. She had the beet salad and I had the octopus. Yup, both couldn't have been better. The descriptions and flavors were right on and I had the added benefit of that 2009 Colli Pesaresi red. For entree, she had the lamb shank and I the veal; she especially liked the polenta, I the roasted vegetables with the veal. We split a pistachio gelato and called it a meal.Everything was great.

They took hours to pay attention to us.     A real disaster, i'm not kidding.  Impersonal, cold, it's like a necessary evil at the Lincoln Center, and the most tourist, pretentious, boring, with the worst food.    The best decision was to ask for the check before desert and escape to Sakagura (read my review) and have a chocolate soufflé there with the sake of the day.  The Lincoln has serious issues.    I ate a beet gnochi, seriously, it looked tike what is gonna look tomorrow in the toilet. If you don't finish a gnocchi, that means, that is impossible to enjoy. The veal that was the best reviewed in yelp, was dry, we had to ask for extra gravy. Even the vibe of our waiter sucked. He was acting like we were in a fancy place, just acting.    The best was the wine, no doubt, a delicious bottle of pinot noir, anyway, this place sucks.    The location is the best, in the middle of Lincoln center, that is was disappoints the most: that having a monster in your hands, a huge high end restaurant they end with this horrible concept and gross food.  By the way the music was jazz but the volume was so low that you couldn't hear a thing.  Bordering the limits of disappointment, Lincoln is a lost cause.",6,4,0,Samuel M.,"Manhattan, NY",62,420,54
4.0,9/28/2011,"Went to Lincoln this past weekend with my wife and a good friend for the first time. Have been meaning to go ever since it opened. My first impression was that the restaurant reminded me of something out of a James bond movie. Very elegant and modern all glass structure underneath a grassy knoll next to the reflecting pool at Lincoln Center. Beautifully designed with outdoor as well as indoor seating. It was a rainy night but people were still eating outside under cover of the roof, which is something you generally can't find in NY so a huge star for that. The crowd was older, which surprised me but shouldn't have, as they were on their way to see a show and it's Lincoln center, geriatric capital of NY, but the place still had a vibrant vibe to it. The servers were all very professional and friendly describing every dish as they came to the table. The wine was excellent and there were reasonable as well as very expensive choices. My only complaint was the Octopus appetizer. Too rubbery. Tolani and Vero do a much better job with softening up the Octopus and making it savory and delectable. At Lincoln it was just rubbery. Tastey but rubbery. My wife and I each had the Halibut as our main course and it was good, nothing to write home about but good. When we arrived we were asked if we were there to see a show, which I appreciated because we had an 8:15 show to make. Overall we had a great time, the pacing of the meal was just right and the service attentive. Took a while to order at first but after that we were well taken care of. I also liked the glass wall that allowed diners to view the Chefs preparing the food and the host and hostess were very young, dapper and cool so that gave the place a hipness the diners didn't provide. Would definitely go back and sit outside next to the reflecting pool.

Main course - Bistecca Alla Griglia (Hangar Steak) cooked perfectly at Medium-Rare sitting on pickeled green tomatoes and mushrooms that had a touch of balsamic flavor. My plate was wiped clean it was so good!Desert - Torta Setteveli  - Which stole the show - a delicate cake that had multiple chocolate and hazelnut mousse layers covered by a chocolate glaze sitting on top of a Hazelnut cream. What was amazing was that this dish wasn't too sweet or rich...and actually felt light.

We came here for brunch on a Saturday, and they offer a 2 course brunch for 32 dollars which does not include any drinks.  Of course they do offer a unique drink where you get to customize the elements that go into it.  Namely, the Prosecco bar where you get to customize your sparkling base wine with your choice of fruit puree and your choice of liquore.  Interesting idea, and at $14 a pop it doesn't come cheap.  Yes i know, this is Lincoln center and nothing is cheap up here but nonetheless if the food is expensive, i expect the taste of the food to be compensated for that.  The pastas we ordered ranged from very good to average.  The carbonara penne was just OK, the pasta slightly under cooked with bits of pancetta in there.  The pasta I ordered was a clam pasta with shishito peppers, it was great.  I loved it, and Im not the biggest fan of clams.  The Linguine was al dente and the flavors were subtle yet distinguishable.  The entrees I ordered the bass, while the wife ordered the porkbelly with poached eggs.  The wife wins this round, the pork belly just fell apart and their version of ham and eggs I could really get used to.  My fish was too salty, and slightly overcooked.  So out of the 4 items of food, half were good, the other half average.  Probably will not return, at least not for brunch that is.",1,0,0,Michael L.,"Houston, TX",117,779,260

The people who work there are extremely professional from the cook all the way to the server. It was all about food and executing it to the T's. I learn alot more about appreicating food for what it is and freshness is always the key. All of the cooks are very knowledgable and knew exactly what to do. I have to say that when Chef Benno left Per Se, he took part of the kitchen with him and everyone is very highly skill. The open/glass kitchen is alittle have to get use to because people can see you exactly what you are doing but u can also look at the customer. The food is Italian and they make everything from scatch like all of their pasta, butchering down all of their meats, going to the local farmer market 3 times a week, etc.The food that I try was good and can't wait to take people here when they come visit me.

5.0,6/22/2011,"Terrific restaurant in Lincoln Center.Definitely a great new addition to the dining scene and one that fills the void left by Convivio and Alto's closures.The restaurant itself is really beautiful and in a prime location. I love the open kitchen and think other restaurants should adopt this practice. You are entertained throughout the meal watching and listening to the chef at work and yes Benno was in the kitchen. And that kitchen is run like a well oiled machine. No kitchen nightmares rendition here- everything is civil, quiet, and all business.The service was really top notch and the pacing of the meal was on point. Onto the food. I decided to go with the following:Appetizer- Soft shell crab. This was an A+ for the soft shell crab. It was enormous, perfectly fried crispy but not too heavy in the batter, and succulent. One of the best I have had and rivaled the soft shells I have in New Orleans. Not sure how they found puppies this big! The pickled veggies were just ok and merely were just garnish.Pasta- Rigate con granchio, sea urchin, orange, and chiles B. I would have loved if there were more crab in this. They used peekytoe crab instead of lump so it was sparingly dispersed throughout. I would have preferred to get crab in every bite which I did not. Also, the pasta was overcooked and not really all that al dente which I would have preferred. The rigate are like curled macaroni and lend well to the sauce because they are able to absorb it in their nooks and crannies. Definitely could taste the heat from the chiles, but I didn't send any orange. Still, it was a tasty dish and a good mid course before my main.Entree- Duck with cherries, turnips, and lamb's quarter A+. A definite standout and one of the best duck preps I have tried. The duck confit had a nice crusty crisp skin and ultra juicy meat that pulled right off the bone. The duck breast was more like a duck steak and it was just one slab of nicely cooked rare duck. The cherries and turnips were really the perfect combo and the whole dish was wonderful.Sides- Gnocchi with morels (spugnole) and melanzana pramigiana A+. Both were terrific, especially the gnocchi. These may have been the best gnocchi I have had and if not definitely one of my favorites. The gnocchi were so soft, pillowy, fluffy that I could have been fooled into thinking they were made with ricotta instead of potato. However, upon tasting you get that potato flavor. The morels were exquisite and the buttery sauce was orgasmic. I couldn't leave without trying their eggplant parm being an Italian boy and it did not disappoint. Not as good as mom's of course, but still a great rendition of this Italian classic.Dessert- The gelatos were terrific. Spumoni, strawberry, and stracciatella.

I'd be happy to return.We started with an antipasto of white asparagus w/duck egg, duck ham & bibb lettuce. Nice. Main courses of pork and hanger steak w/red wine reduction were quite good. Nothing incredibly innovative or exquisite, but we had no trouble cleaning our plates.

3.0,3/17/2011,"Lincoln is like the Prom Queen: Highly anticipated, inevitably predictable, and superficially pleasant. There's so much to love about Lincoln! The swivel chairs, the setting, the lighting, the decor, the open kitchen, and the calm atmosphere. Notably absent amongst the highlights are food and service. That's a bit of a problem.FOOD:I heard they imported this super-cool uber expensive pasta machine for their pastas, despite the chef's initial hesitation. I hope they bought it at Kohl's because it needs to be returned. I could make better pasta with a play dough press. I've had pasta there multiple times and it's ALWAYS over cooked! Ugh!The rest of the plates are just not interesting. Ooooh, mozzarella salad? Brussel sprouts with pancetta? Steak for two? How on earth did they come up with this menu?!? Really pushing the bounds of creativity....In all seriousness, the food doesn't have to be innovative if it's made flawlessly, but that's not the case at Lincoln. The restaurant is completely too bland for its setting.SERVICE:Generally not good. Slow service, waiters disappearing. Many times I was surprised by our inability to get someone's attention considering the caliber of the restaurant.Overall, Lincoln may ultimately share the fate of many a prom queen... shining bright at a young age and then fading into an expired, knocked up, overweight, hot mess?

4.0,3/5/2011,"Full review in blog, highlights below:A pre-concert meal was obviously in order and as such I decided to spend it with the man who crafted the best meal I've ever had in New York City, a 25+ course extended tasting that still resonates with me over a year later - Jonathan Benno.My final amuse of the evening would be the best of the group and a substantial portion at that - tartar of big eye tuna with fennel, basil, and olive oil.  While tuna tartar is clearly a played theme, this ceviche styled version all but melted on the tongue while and the vegetal ingredients acted in composition with the fish to highlight the sweeter tones of the protein.Kicking off the menu proper, now approximately 50 minutes and ten different tastes into my meal, would be my request from the nightly tasting.  For $24, Terrina Di Anguilla Affumicata E Fegato Grasso (Smoked Eel and Foie Gras Terrine, Bosc Pear, Sicilian Pistachios, Balsamico Gran Riserva Oro) would not disappoint.  Weighing in at likely 1.5-2.0 ounces, the terrine itself was uniquely presented with the eel deboned, smoked, and packed into the unctuous liver - a remarkable taste and textural pairing that pleased the tongue and eye.  Sitting alongside the terrie was a boozy pear tossed with grassy pistachios while a line of balsamic graced the front of the plate.  While I'll note that I generally prefer my terrines with a warm bread or toast, the dish was otherwise quite impressive and balanced.Next moving into heavier dishes, my second selection was from the side dish section - in this case the daily gnocchi:  Gnocchi di Patate Al Tartufo Nero.  Listed at $25 but billed at only $14 (the normal daily price when the dish is served without truffles) this dish was the steal of the trip and every bit as good as the similarly fashioned gnocchi with black truffles that I remember from my extended tasting at the French Laundry.  Perfect morsels of melting butter and potato, castelmagno cheese, and earthy aromatic truffles - after watching me enjoy each bite my neighbor opted to forgo dessert and order one of her own.Course three would be another pairing of carb, cheese, and truffle - this time Speck e Polenta.  Presented in a shallow bowl patterned precisely off of those at TFL and Per Se, the dish featured creamy Anson Mills White Polenta intermingling with Castelrosso cheese and chopped black truffles.  Topping the dish off with four thin slices of uncured pork the flavors all balanced well and, as an additional surprise, the base of the bowl was layered with another thin layer of truffles.For my final selection of the evening, a proper pasta - I just had to see if a $3,500 pasta machine was worth the hype.  Noting to me that the portion sizes of the pastas had recently been increased and that I had ordered a lot of heavy food I assured him I would be okay, but when the dish arrived I had to admit I was surprised at the size - vastly larger than a pasta at Babbo, Del Posto, Marea, or Scarpetta.  Titled Rigatoni Al Salsiccia Piccante the nicely prepared al dente tubes were matched with spicy Berkshire Pork Sausage, Salvatore Brooklyn Ricotta, Fresh Basil, and a toss of mildly acidic tomato sauce.  Simply done, rustic, and delicious even if perhaps a bit overpriced at $22.Returning next with a spoon for myself and one for my neighbor it appeared Jeffery had clearly taken it upon himself to let us decide whether the house sorbetti and gelati were ""as good as Grom.""  Presented with three flavors each - Mint Stracciatella, Oro Blanco Grapefruit, and Malted Milk for myself and Chocolate, Fennel, and Bosc Pear for my neighbor.  With each scoop rested atop a complimentary crumble and topped with a thin crispy tuille I really cannot say whether the flavors were better than Grom, but they were all quite good and my neighbor definitely thought her Bosc Pear was Grom level.Moving on to my proper dessert (and at this point quite full,) this dish would be the first less-than-excellent ordered course of the night largely because it wasn't what I expected.  Titled Budino All Averna E Cannolo Di Ricotta E Cioccolato, I rather expected a proper budino pudding, but what I received instead was a sort of hybrid dish featuring two chocolate shelled cannoli stuffed with ricotta and mascarpone and an dense chocolate ganache flanking candied kumquats.Making my way down the street I was once again struck by the criticism that Benno has gotten for Lincoln - prices too expensive, the room too impersonal, the portions too small - none of it seemed valid, though clearly changes have been made since the spot originally opened.  While the experience is certainly not Per Se and the location certainly means different things to different people - a dining destination for some versus a pre-theater bite for others I think the space is elegant and unstuffy, the food precise yet familiar, and the kitchen like nothing I've ever seen.",0,0,0,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503

Highly recommend the Rigatoni Bolognese if you're in the mood for something on the comfort food side, and you won't go wrong with any of the antipastis. I would have given Lincoln a 5-star, but there was an awkward service moment when one of our servers got chewed out in the open kitchen by some German maitre'd fellow... totally lame.

2.0,2/15/2011,"I originally was not planning to post this, but I recently went to Marea and was reminded of how good a restaurant can be. So here is my review:What an utter disappointment this restaurant turned out to be. With a raving review by the NY Times and multiple magazines deeming it to be the top 10 to open in New York, I had high expectations. Instead I left extremely disappointed.  The atmosphere, location and service was great, and I expected as much. Unfortunately the food was not nearly as spectacular. Let me start by saying that I opted for their tasting menu ($110 per person) and did not choose anything al carte. Since it was my first time and was planning to return again, I wanted to let the chef decide.The first course was great. It was the smoked eel and foie gra terrine, along with a pear and pistachio salad. What a great way to start the dinner. Then it went downhill. The next two dishes were pasta dishes. Why the chef decided to have back to back seafood pasta dishes, is beyond me. Both were rich in flavor. The first dish, the malloreddus, had cuore di tonno (tuna) which somehow made the dish smell fishy. The linguine with crab tasted great, but the pasta was not. I'm sure they wanted al dente, but turned out hard. Also coming after another heavy pasta dish, it had already lost its allure. The menu said there was Maine sea urchin, but there was no hint of it. For the main course was the red-wine braised beef short ribs. This was very disappointing. The meat was soft but too fatty and the sauce was unexceptional. I could have had this at any other Italian restaurant but at Lincoln? I expected more. As I mentioned, the beef was too fatty so I couldn't finish the dish.  Finally the nail in the coffin was the cheese plate. It was blue cheese and quince, turnips and red romaine. If you are wondering what a combination of ""quince, turnips and red romaine"" can be like, well I can't really describe it either except that it was awkward. I didn't understand how any of the ingredients complemented one another. I complained to the waiter who offered us complementary drinks. The dessert was fine, but by this point, the whole experience was just disappointing. I wished it was better, but alas, it was not.",3,0,1,Go K.,"New York, NY",37,1,2
4.0,2/7/2011,"This review is for brunch. Firstly, I like the fact that they offer a comprehensive brunch menu on weekends unlike many places. The room is a contemporary marvel. It reminds me of a combination of the restaurant George Jetson took Jane to for their anniversary and the waiting area at the Amsterdam Airport. The floor to ceiling windows also leave you with a bit of a voyeur effect. ""Why is that Lincoln Center security guard standing in the rain looking at me like that? Is he a fan of a nice beet salad too? The food was good but didn't ""knock my socks off"". The brunch amuse bouche was a homemade yogurt/granola type dish with a thin coating of pear underneath. It was totally delicious! The aforementioned beet salad was also excellent with three varieties of beets with crumbled porcino cheese. The cuttlefish was cooked perfectly but I was a bit underwhelmed with the pasta that accompanied it. The Hampshire pork belly was a bit bland but it was saved by the farro and kale that came with it (even though the parsnips were unevenly cooked to the point where I pushed them aside). The Monkfish was cooked perfectly but the potatoes and artichokes did little to add much dimension. I loved the bite size pastry items that were thrown in for dessert. The $14 bloody mary tasted like Mr. & Mrs. T. Pass on that. I can't help but think this place will only get better with time. It feels like they started out with extremely ambitious plans and are still working out some of the rough spots.  I'm glad I tried the $100 brunch before the $400 dinner.",0,0,0,Paul Q.,"New York, NY",0,168,31
3.0,2/3/2011,"I was in New York for a weekend partying it up like a rockstar, and this was one of our dinner places.The Ambiance: Old. most of the people who came to dine were older. It's generally quiet, so it's got a very calm atmosphere. This was good because we had been clubbing two days straight and this was exactly what we needed. However i'm sure for a regular dinner the ambiance would bore me to death, and then when you take a look around, it's a bunch of old stuffy people.The interior is beautiful, though the bathroom is down stairs, and quite a trek, it is still nice because you are walking by the kitchen and you get a nice view of what they are doing in there.The Food:The food was good, I distinctively remember a polenta dish with prosciutto on it. It was delicious. The others were your run of the mill flavors, it's all good, and it's what you expect from such a restaurant.The service: Excellent, the staff were wonderful.I thought their desert menu was completely lacking compared to the dinner menu.

4.0,1/17/2011,"Came here and had the dinner tasting menu for $110.We started with some crostini, which consister of a crunchy breadstick that was a little spicy, and a sesame seed cracker (carta de musica) that was light, crunchy, and baked with herbs. The bread was served was cannellini bean paste, which was a little soupy but had nice flavor.The free starter that came with the meal was squash and goat cheese in a fried dough, that had a nice texture on the inside but I would like it more crispy. It was good.The testa with salsa verde and celery came first. The testa tasted incredible with the salsa but was pretty great alone. It was chewy, a little gelatinous and probably the best headcheese I've ever had. The celery on top seemed right and this was one of my favorite dishes. Next came the malloredus which was egg, tuna heart and lemon in pasta. It was salty, fishy, and al dente. Overall the malloredus had a strong sea smell and taste.The ravioli came stuffed with nova scotia lobster, chanterelle mushrooms and tarragon, and had an open bottom. The perfect bite of the ravioli would incorporate the mushroom, lobster and pasta (which was al dente all on one forkful. The lobster was very fresh and a little chewy, and there was a large piece of lobster meat in the dish. This was the best dish of the night. The red wine braised short rib with barley and mushroom came next. The beef fell apart without a knife, and the barley was a little chewy and al dente. The mushrooms added great flavor and the sauce was not too salty and great on the beef.The cheese course was quince, beets and gorgonzola. The quince was cooked in red wine and was a little sweet. On the bottom of the plate spiced red wine was made into a sauce. There were also turnips int he course and they were crunchy. The gorgonzola cheese was stinky and tasty. The sorbet came with a yogurt cube, anise curd, and on top of an olive oil cake. The anise curd was creamy and sweet, but you can definitely taste the anise. The yogurt cube was a little sour and sweet, but the sorbet was bittersweet. If eaten as a bite of curd, sorbet and olive oil cake it was tasty but separately it was just ok. Finally, the chocolate cake was warm and rich, and came with latte gelato and hazelnut sauce. The crushed toppings underneath gelato gave nice crunch and needed texture to the gelato.The decor was modern and you are sitting in a glass dining room inside Lincoln Center. There were people walking by and staring at us while we ate, which can be a little odd, but what do you expect in Manhattan? The service was great and the meal was enjoyable.

The ambiance: the interior design is gorgeous, top to bottom glass window overlooking 65th street, dim light and soft music (spanish guitar and lounge), good for private conversation, open kitchen where you can see all the action are happening. The whole environment is very high class and elegant, while still maintaining a sense of intimacy. Would be a great date spot :)The food: Before we ordered, the waiter put two plates of complimentary appetizer at our table, olive oil cracker and bread stick. I tired the cracker, so good! Jump to the wine list  I usually judge the quality of the restaurant by the wine list and the knowledge level of the waiter. Lincoln dose not disappoint me. I ordered a glass of prosecco based on recommendation. bellissimo! The wine list is extended and the waiter was very knowledge about the wine and pairing. Bonus 0.5 point!Ordering food. I have to mention, the portion for the entree is small, but the dessert is different scenario. We will get into that later. Being said that, the quality is well worth the $40 - $70 price tag. I had the Cacciuco, a mixed sea food dish in Spanish style tomato sauce. Yum! I was a bit surprised how small the portion it was when the dish came - literally a piece of Spanish Mackel, one sea  scallop, a prawn, 2 tiny little neck clams, a piece of lobster, $36. I have been to many high end, Michelin Stars restaurants in the city, but this is by far the smallest entree I have see. Even for a 90Lb like me. However, the flavor was very rich and satisfying. So I digress. My date ordered LASAGNE INTEGRALI AI FUNGHI. It was still smaller than usual size, but he was very happy about it. Before our entree was served, the waiter came and served our bread. 3 options, Coccacia, 12 Grain, and Plain. We both got the Coccacia, it was great!  P.S. the bread will be unlimited refill through the whole night, until you tell them to stop. Dessert. My date ordered TIRAMISÚ. It was huge! We had to share it,. It was one of the best I have had in the city. It was very different from the one you usually see in other cafe/restaurant. It was round, served in a bowl instead of a plate. More like a custard, but bigger. The layer of cake was thin. Love the flavor of cocoa rum :)After we finished the tiramisu, the waiter brought in some complimentary goodies: peanut butter cream cookies, chocolate rum candy, and some other cute little things I don't recall the name :) I am usually not a desert person, but they were too good to miss! All in all, I have a great dinner experiences here and will definitely come back soon for the tasting menu :)One regret though.

5.0,12/20/2010,"I had a chance to visit Lincoln Ristorante, a $20 million, 100+ seat restaurant operated by Patina Restaurant Group at Lincoln Center on my recent trip to NYC.  The restaurant has only been opened a couple months and is headed by Jonathan Benno, the former chef de cuisine at Thomas Keller's Per Se for 5 years.The restaurant is housed inside a glass-enclosed pavilion, topped with a curved, sloping roof covered with grass and open to the public.  Entering the building to meet the hostess on a rainy night, we were greeted with a coat check offering.  Looking around, the interior of the restaurant has a sloping ceiling covered in dark wood.  I got a sense that the place is modern and chic.  The kitchen is open and occupies a central spot that we were able to see from our round booth we were seated in that also overlooked the steps of the Julliard School.The bread offered was red pepper flake bread sticks which were crunchy with a slight heat and crisps dusted with parmigiano reggiano and pork fat. The crisps were addicting.  There was a second bread service consisting of focaccia served with butter and Laudemio olive oil.  I had to help myself to a second serving.  We put together our own tasting menu selecting several items off the a la carte menu although there was a set tasting menu offered.  We also relied on the sommelier to pair our food selections with wine and were not disappointed.  All the wines on the wine list are Italian.We ordered the foie gras, oxtail and beef tongue terrine (terrina di fegato grasso, coda di bue e lingua) which was phenomenal and full of complex flavors and textures.  I'm still thinking about this dish.Next we had the veal sweetbread (animelle e abalone in paccata) which came with tiger abalone, oyster mushrooms, salsify and spinach.  Never trying sweetbread before, I didn't know what to expect.  After I had a bite, I was informed by my company that it is prepared with a calf's thymus gland.  Call it what you will, I am now a fan of offal.We moved onto the lobster ravioli with chanterelle mushrooms and tarragon (raviolo d'astice). This dish was playful and seemed to be a deconstructed ravioli dish.  The firm lobster meat was the star in the center of the bowl with the tarragon chanterelle sauce surrounding it and an open ravioli pasta sheet draped over it.  It was absolutely delicious.With truffles in season, we also couldn't resist ordering the tagliatelle pasta with black truffle (tartufo nero) flavored with parmigiano reggiano cheese and the white truffle risotto (tartufo bianco d'alba) flavored with castelmagno cheese.  Both were exceptional.  The flavor is like nothing else on earth.  If I had to describe it, I would say it's a combination of earthy mushroom flavors and strong garlic-like aromas, but I'm not convinced even that captures it appropriately.  The truffles were shaved over the bowl of pasta in front of me and it was an otherworldly experience that goes beyond tasting and smelling.  Every food lover should experience it at least once.We ended the meal with tiramisu, a traditional Italian dessert, which I don't particularly enjoy, but this version was different than the standard ones I've had in the past and I thoroughly enjoyed the taste and texture.The entire meal was truly an event to remember with excellent service and memorable food and wine.  I'll be sure to visit this restaurant again during my next visit to NYC.",3,0,2,Aimee W.,"Pensacola, FL",8,10,0

I left 1/3 of it on my plate anticipating my fish, and woke up this morning with regrets. The space is lovely, being on the inside and spying on the kitchen and looking out at the water.  Service is pretty swift and professional and sassy (if you're the kind of person who makes jokes with waiters). We were the youngest of the pre-theater crowd and then just one other young couple as we left. Crostata was wolfed down and Monte Bianco was delicious, although not my total frozen treat. Cocktails were great - quince/prosecco/peach bitters and the manhattan. I will not run back to spend $120/person, but I won't say no if it's your birthday and you want us to go there - I'll just order the burrata (amazing) and crab pasta and call it a night.",0,0,0,Jessica S.,"New York, NY",13,166,0

Branzino tatare, Bacala and potato cake with a sweet and sourEggplant relish, pasta con le sarde, sea urchin pasta and split the fresh smoked sturgeon main course. Skipped dessert. Too full.All were standouts. So elegant and well prepared. The mustard vinaigrette with the sturgeon was just outstanding.Beautiful table service. Excellent wine. Lovely airy room.So-so bread service and petits fours. Nice chick pea amuse.My only quibble was the wait staff. All male and pretentious.

1.0,11/5/2010,"Much ado about nothing...I mean really...nothing.  This is a restaurant that doesn't know what or who it is.  They purport to offer a welcoming atmosphere, but I challenge any normal person to move their chair closer to the table so that they can reach their meal.  The chairs are covered in faux white leather and each weighs about 90 pounds.  The servers look scared of the supercilious manager who prances about when he is not glaring at his staff.  Like many other reviewers, I, too, found the food to be salty.  Even the dessert was salty.  Last, I find it interesting that Benno was reported in the NYTimes as ""courting"" the farmers at the Green Market.  This is a man who worked under Thomas Keller for many years,who, of course, promotes supporting local producers, etc..  Yet, Benno imports canned tomatoes and pasta from Italy.  Really?  Overall, nice try.  The servers and bartenders get an ""A"" for effort.  The space itself is gorgeous, but it would make a better art gallery than a highfalutin Italian ""Ristorante.""",5,2,1,CJ M.,"Astoria, NY",1,17,0
5.0,11/2/2010,"I first noticed the restaurant a week before it opened with my mother one night while in Lincoln Center.  When they opened the next week or so our party of 4 went to dinner there and my mother and I returned again by ourselves.       It is such a beautiful and well decorated restaurant/building.  It is quite inviting and not intimidating.  As may people have already mentioned there were peppered grissini, crisp flatbread brushed with pork fat and pepper, and flat bread brushed with olive oil and sesame served as we sat down.  They then brought the chickpea amuse bouche and a second bread selection of country white, semolina, or focaccia accompanied by Vermont butter or olive oil.       The first time we went, we all shared a simple salad and the Seafood Rigati to start.  The Salad was very fresh, but ultimately it was simply salad leaves spritzed with oil and vinegar.  The Rigati (a macaroni-iike solid tube pasta) is amazing every time, but it is heading to the point where it is bitterly salty.  It is full of seafood flavor with several lumps of sea urchin and crab.  The first time we went, I was blown away by the wonderful flavor and I did notice it was saltier than I would have liked, but the second time we went, the pasta was possibly even saltier.  It is absolutely delicious and I am addicted to the point that I will still order it next time, but I do hope they get enough feedback to tone down the salt.  This second time we dined, we also ordered the Burrata with Squash.  This is a delicious dish of creamy, salty, cheese over slightly sweet cooked squash.  It was perfect.     During our first dinner, our table ordered a Lasagna (which is no longer on the menu), the Red Snapper Brodetto, and a fish special.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  I even reordered the brodetto the second time I went.  It is a fresh piece of Red Snapper over Fregula (a couscous-like pasta) in a thick tomato sauce cooked with seafood (clams, prawn...etc.).  My mother ordered the King Salmon the second time we went and she enjoyed it.     Dinner ends with a wonderful plate of little bites each time and we didn't have time for dessert the first time, but we made sure to try something the last time we went.  We ordered the Monte Bianco a chestnut, chocolate, and buttermilk tartufo dessert.  It is a center of chestnut sorbet surrounded by buttermilk gelato covered in a thin shell of chocolate.  There are candied chestnuts and a small chocolate tart garnishing it.  It was wonderfully rich but not overly sweet.  The buttermilk gelato was interesting with the tart, yogurt-like taste.  The little plate of complimentary sweets differed slightly when we went the second time.  There is a anise biscotti, a ""rainbow cookie""-like piece though instead of almond it was flavored with yogurt and apple I believe, a coffee meringue, an almond and chocolate macaron, and a pistachio cookie.     The service is wonderful and getting better each time.  Go at an off time, for example: after the theater crowd has left, and you will have great, attentive service.  Things are running much more smoothly and professionally as time goes on and they will probably continue to perfect everything as time goes on.     It can be pricey depending on what you order, but it's not unreasonable nor unexpected considering the location and the clientele.  They are also offering a tasting menu of 7 dishes for $120.  I would definitely recommend it for a special night out at Lincoln Center or any occasion.",2,0,1,K Y.,"Yonkers, NY",91,16,3
3.0,11/1/2010,"2.5 stars for the food rounded up to 3 for the beautiful interior.Four words - Grand opening, grand closing. At least that's what I think will happen to this much over-hyped restaurant. Per the NY Times, Mr. Jonathan Benno (former chef de cuisine of Per Se) wanted to reinvent himself and had been scribbling down ideas for several years for an Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, those ideas lack the 1-2 flavor punches that Michael White serves at both Convivio and Marea (dined here a week after the Lincoln and thought to myself...boy can Mr Benno get some tips from Mr White). The restaurant itself was gorgeous, but I'm 99% sure that most people book fine dining restaurants for the food and not the atmosphere. The other reviews summed up the food perfectly - nothing memorable, just meh. I expected really big things for this restaurant and several friends flew in to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday here. What a disappointment...but at least ABC Kitchen the next night more than made up for a truly lackluster experience at the Lincoln.Take your money and spend it at Convivio or Marea for a truly delicious experience. For now, the Lincoln will truly disappoint you if you have high expectations based on any articles you have read in the papers or online.",4,0,0,Eugene K.,"New York, NY",4,6,0

2.0,10/22/2010,"With Jonathan Benno's leave from Per Se to launch his own Italian restaurant at Lincoln Center, a reservation at Lincoln Ristorante has become, de facto, one of the hottest seats in town.  It is also one of the worst values for money in town resulting from serving underwhelming, technically flawed dishes on high rent, prime real estate.  I attended dinner courtesy of Jeff C.'s Meetup group and was counted among a party of 4.  Once we were settled, the wine menus were pushed on us.  I found this strange wondering where the regular menus were.  I am of the strange school of thought that I make my wine choices based on the food I will be ordering, which is customary elsewhere.  Fortunately the waiter was kind enough to eventually bring a food menu, and I was able to make my wine and food order together.  While we were waiting for our dinner to formally begin, we  were brought a choice of bread (white, wheat, semolina, or focaccia), grissini, crackers draped with pork fat, and an amuse bouche.  With all of the selection, I was surprised that there was nothing memorable.For the first course, I began with the rigati ($30) which was served with dungeness crab, sea urchin, sea beans, and peppers.  The pasta was very lovely with perfect texture, size, and consistency.  The sea urchin was not especially present throughout the dish, and, as a result, missed in really overwhelming the dish in creamy goodness.  The sea beans were novel and worked well, but the crab was a miss as it was just not cleaned properly.  Both I and another diner found small shell fragments in our respective plates.  Another technical error was the high sodium level of the dish, so high that the other diner had to inform the waiter of the problem.  My glass of Lazio Bianco ($14) could not fix this problem, so I awaited the next course.For the second course, I had the brodetto di pesce ($38) which was served with red snapper, fregula, shrimp, and shellfish broth.  This was simply served, I must say, which was a missed opportunity for the waitstaff to grandly pour the broth into the bowl tableside, an elegant effect that always goes appreciated.  But of course they could not have done any such thing with my dish, as there was virtually no broth to speak of.  Indeed, what broth there was, was boiled down, presumably to enhance the flavor, but the effect was not rendered.  The fregula should have added a nice contrast in texture, but it was easy to forget that it was there.  The shellfish broth amounted to a couple of lone clams lost in a sea of less than wowing flavors.  The snapper though was of excellent quality, prepared perfectly, and tasted great.  The same can be said for the prawn which was served with its head on, a boast of its freshness with a hint of audacity.  Less than pleased with my two courses, I sat out the lackluster list of fruit-laden desserts, and simply opted for coffee ($4.50) and petit fours.  Imagine my surprise when I received my individual bill without an envelope in the amount of $103 after taxes and before tip!  Okay, so we agreed to be ""fair"" and split the bill evenly among the four of us, but adjusting for the cost of being fair, I clearly paid a lot of money for two courses of decent, but not great food.  At this price point I could have enjoyed a wonderful, I dare say amazing, sea urchin pasta at Adour Alain Ducasse or simply opted for a brodetto at Esca at a savings.  Chef Benno seems to think he has taken his Michelin stars with him with the opening of this restaurant and has adjusted the prices accordingly.  I say this is borderline shameless given the technical errors I witnessed.  Avoid.",18,4,5,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044
4.0,10/4/2010,"Disclaimer: My ratings are based on value compared to other restaurants of the same cuisine and of a similar price point.  A $10 meal could very well score 5 stars if the restaurant delivered excellent value.  Similarly, a $100 meal could score 1 star if the food was dismal compared to its similarly-priced brethren.  For the most part, my ratings will be based on the quality of the food, unless I explicitly comment on the service or the decor.In this case, I'd like to add another disclaimer: I cannot claim to be familiar with Italian cuisine, especially of the fine dining variety.  Thus, my only basis for comparison will have to be restaurants of a similar price point but of a different cuisine, and a number of Italian establishments in San Francisco but at a different price point.I will readily admit that I had read a number of reviews (from blogs, foodie forums, and newspapers) prior to my visit and, ultimately, the evening can be summed up in one word: surprise.Architecture: Everyone talks about the glass walls, the wonderful views and the awesome location.  The surprise?  The green roof, open for public use.  It was raining the night I went, but it would have been delightful to stroll up the roof and take in the view from there.Food: The first surprise of the evening was that there was no tasting menu.  Instead, we were encouraged to take the traditional route of an antipasti, primi, secondi and dessert - although the chef would have been willing to create a tasting menu if we insisted.  We chose to take up the challenge of ordering for ourselves.This, I think, is really where the subjectivity of taste comes into play.I loved the contrast between the amuse bouche of the saffron rice ball and the fried olive stuffed with sausage (surprisingly juicy).I loved the contrast between the refreshing burrata with tomatoes, cucumber and celery  (no surprise, it was yummy) and the creamy, chewy tripe in a tomato sauce with breadcrumbs.The rigati with dungeness crab and pacific sea urchin probably didn't have quite enough sea urchin for my taste, but it had a subtle, ocean-y creaminess that contrasted well with the burst of flavor from the cavatelli with razor clams, peppers and lemon thyme.  The surprise?  From reading previous reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect, but the kitchen delivered and I was suitably impressed.  If nothing else, this gives me confidence that the chefs are becoming more familiar with the menu every day and are ramping up at a rapid speed.The lamp chop and shoulder with sausage was wonderful.  The surprise came from (purely hypothetical speculation regarding) its construction.  My college buddy and I believe the chefs did something quite clever with the sausage and the lamb to achieve the balance between the gamey flavor and fatty goodness, but we forgot to ask for confirmation before we left.  This mystery will have to remain unsolved, for now.  The veal with gnocchi was probably the only disappointing dish of the evening.  The veal was definitely not medium-rare and closer to the well-done side of the spectrum, and the gnocchi that came with the veal was overwhelmed with cheese.  The surprise was the gnocchi for the table (a separate dish altogether), which was delicious.  It was hard to reconcile the two gnocchis, though it seemed clear that they used two different cheeses.  I have no other explanation.Dessert: We ordered the torta di ricotta with figs and fennel pollen gelato and the sbrisolona with coffee semi-freddo and banana rum sorbetto.  I expected to like the torta di ricotta more, not being a huge fan of coffee, but the sbrisolona was surprisingly good.  The crumbly cake complemented the sorbetto and caramelized banana slices in both texture and flavor.  We were also offered two complimentary desserts to celebrate my friend's belated birthday.Wine: We placed our palates in the hands of the extremely capable sommelier.  I would not consider myself knowledgeable about wine but, living only a drive away from Napa/Sonoma, I didn't expect to be surprised.  The Monastero Suore Cistercensi ""Coenobium"" Lazio Bianco is produced by sisters in a nunnery north of Rome and its fragrant complexity is worth trying.Service: Professional, friendly, pretty much what you would expect from a top restaurant.  Sometimes, it seemed like there were a few too many waiters around but that will probably change once the restaurant ramps up to capacity.  Currently, they're still limiting the number of tables served each evening.  I expect that the staff:diner ratios will normalize in a month or two.Overall, it was a wonderful four-course meal for two.  With a glass of wine each, the bill came to just under $260 (~$130/head), not including tip.",5,1,0,Cynthia Y.,"Oakland, CA",41,30,21
2.0,10/3/2010,"One of my most anticipated restaurant openings of 2010, I immediately booked my two-top when the reservation hot line opened up in early September. Suffice to say, the Lincoln is as stunning as the new renovations to Lincoln Center, with soaring glass walls, sloping white stair cases, tall vases with beautiful flowers, and an opulent view that makes you feel like you're eating in the courtyard of Lincoln Center. The service was impeccable as well, with a staff that's professional, diligent, and polite.However, with the feedback that I got from those who attended Friends and Family night, I thought my meal would be nothing short of amazing. Expectations were set extremely high before this restaurant event opened, and unlike Per Se, I have to painfully admit Lincoln failed to met them. Although there wasn't any technical fault with the dishes we had, nothing really stood out with the exception of the amuse bouches of fried olive stuffed with sausage and chickpea cake.For an antipasti, we started out with the tripe in tomato sauce and the foie gras and rabbit terrine with seckel pair. The tripe lacked the meaty unctuousness of the traditional dish, and the foie gras lacked a harmony with seckel pear like what you would get with a traditional foie gras / sauterne pairing.Next were the pasta courses: rigati with dungeness crab and sea urchin and sea beans and cavatelli with razor clams and peppers. The rigati was creamy, but you just didn't get the heady harmony between the crab, pasta, and buttery sea urchin that you get for the same dish at Esca. The cavatelli was probably the most disappointing, with the sharp, garlicky notes of razor clams failing to make an appearance.For a main course, we had the lamb chop with pressed lamb shoulder and the brodetto di pesce with red snapper and head-on shrimp in a saffron-tomato reduction. Both were elegantly presented, but straightforward and not very exciting. Lastly, we ended our meal with a sbrisolona, an Italian-style coffee cake milk chocolate mousse, banana rum sorbetto, and bruleed banana slices. The latter were a delight to eat, but the coffee cake was a bit dry.For any restaurant that just opened within their first month, there are obviously still some issues to work out, and no doubt the Lincoln will get better with every passing day. But for the $150+ cost of this meal, the value proposition wasn't there, especially with steep competition from Del Posto, Esca, Maialino, Marea, and Scarpetta.",14,4,7,Jonas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,166,0
1.0,10/3/2010,"THE EMPEROR WITH NO FOOD ON PLATES-  I feel bad for the nice staff.  They are working hard at a restaurant that barely serves food on its plates.  The whole thing is bizarre- the few strings of pasta (entree portion) were served on an oversized plate.  It made the presentation laughable.  I expected Ed McMahon and Dick Clark to come out with a Bloopers video crew.  Our friends at the table said immediately- ""Looks like we're getting pizza on the street.""We've been to fancy restaurants before. where portions are small and limited, but this took the cake (excuse the food reference as I must be hungry).  The pasta comprised about 1/9th of the empty plate.  I'm no fancy chef, but does the pasta cost that much that pasta needs to be rationed?  It's like SURVIVOR: LINCOLN on CBS.  ""You have four hours on the Upper West Side and 16 people must share an appetizer of pasta.""The fancy owner would make a ton of $ if he opened a pizza place next door.  Or maybe Shake Shack: Lincoln.The night started with a convoluted policy/pitch about unlimited water for $3.  The policy, the extra emphasis on this, the mentioning of cost was all wrong immediately and seemed ridiculously out of human touch.How did the food taste?  Honestly, I'm not sure and I'm not kidding.  The portions were so small that I tasted more fork, than food.  Will anyone tell the EMPEROR that he has no food on the plates and is lacking a human touch?  By the empty seats, my guess is he's already been told subtly.  If he really wanted to hear the advice, he should just go to the pizza places nearby and ask his recent diners.",2,2,0,Amy K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

5.0,9/24/2010,"I came here for the last Friends and Family night before Lincoln's opening and wow was I impressed.  First the space is just absolutely stunning.  We had a corner table at the 65th St side of the restaurant with a perfect view of Lincoln Center and Julliard.  The off-white carpet and chairs made me feel like I was in a 1950's living room a la Mad Men.  It's an awesome feeling, I recommend experiencing it.Even more awesome was the service.  When we sat down we were offered glasses of prosecco.  I'm on a hiatus from drinking right now but the waiter brought me some sparkling lemonade which was one of the little things that made the evening so nice.  To start we were given a friend saffron rice ball with cheese and a fried olive stuffed with sausage, both were amazing.  The foccacia bread was some of the best I've ever had.  For an appetizer I ordered the scallop which came with almond puree, slivered almonds, and another root vegetable.  The scallop was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I've honestly never had one this good!  Yes, it was a small dish - only 1, but huge, scallop.  However, this was perfect - the scallop was so rich and buttery I didn't need another.  I also tasted the foie gras which was literally melted in my mouth and the lasagna which was lighter than most and absolutely delicious.I had the loin of lamb for a main course which came with garlic sausage and roman cauliflower.  The loin was so good and cooked perfectly - medium rare.  It was just pink enough inside and so tender I barely needed to chew it.  It was also perfectly seasoned - I ate every last bite!  The garlic sausage was a little bland on it's own but with the sauce it was perfect.  We had the gnocchi and eggplant parmesan sides - my only complaint was that I wanted more.Then it was time for dessert - secret to fit it in, wear leggings.  The tea selection is great, I recommend the honey oolong.  It's also really apparent the staff knows their tea which is a nice change from a box of tea bags.  I don't remember exactly what it was called but I had the peach tart with caramel ice cream and it was amazing.  We also shared the tartufo with cherries which was delicious and the chocolate was perfectly rich.  I was lucky enough to try my friend Jenny's banana dessert which was definitely the best one of the bunch (yes, we ordered all 5).  Overall Lincoln was excellent.  While I cannot speak to the prices (I have no idea what they are) the food and service were outstanding.  It's a beautiful space and great atmosphere to enjoy a leisurely meal.",4,3,1,Margot A.,"New York, NY",57,136,3
