5.0,4/27/2019,Service is excellent and then food fascinatingly delicious ! Mona and James had us coming back for more. The happy hour is phenomenal- dollar oysters in Manhattan! A must do is the special bacon! The Salmon melts in your mouth and the burger is excellent. Location is great and ambiance is pure enjoyment.,0,0,0,Patty n.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,17,10
4.0,4/23/2019,"Came for Happy Hour around 6 and it was packed!  The specials are pretty solid with $10 burgers, $5 fries, and $1 oysters, along with $10 drink specials.  The seating is pretty comfortable at the bar and there are booths in the lounge filled with locals.The burger and fries are definitely the go-to items here: ~60% of the diners appeared to order those!  The burger was nice and juicy on a toasted english muffin - the only thing is that it was a bit on the saltier side  but not bad.  The fries were also solid - crispy and soft inside.  For $15 on the UES, it's very solid.They do have the Impossible Burger on the menu but they run out very quickly so I would call and ask if they have any if that is what you have in mind!  The staff are pretty friendly although your mileage may vary depending on the bartender.Worth a visit for Happy Hour if you are in the area and looking for a filling and quick bite.",2,0,1,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1915,85
5.0,4/22/2019,"Stopped in for lunch and I am delighted we did. The lunch menu has a great prix fixe option and we only wanted two courses. I started with the lobster dumplings, my daughter( a chef at a fine restaurant downtown) had the carpaccio. We both had the salmon entree. The food was excellent in every respect, and the service was great. Bartender and waiter were attentive but not intrusive. This is an excellent place for a lunch.",0,0,0,Errol G.,"New York, NY",2,75,0
1.0,4/7/2019,"Just completed a wildly disappointing meal here. Dishes that were awful: chicken noodle soup (bland, down right unseasoned broth), and the burrata salad which was extremely salty. Also it was much less of a burrata, as there was no enjoyable gooey center, and much more of a piece of mozzarella.Service was uninformed. We asked what was on the salad, as there were dietary restrictions and she only told us of 2/10 ingredients . Leaving out that there was pork, which presented an issue.  Sunday is half off bottles of wine, so that helped.The pretzel crab cake Benedict was good, as was the branzino.",0,0,0,Simon A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,28,6
5.0,3/20/2019,"What can I say? When you just hear the name David Burke you know your in for a great treat! With a menu Second to none and a wonderful and Extremely polite staff, dine on some of the finest dishes with exquisite flavors, come on down and sink you teeth into all natural foods.If there were 10 Stars I would give it that from the delicious food to the warm staff they treated us like royalty. You will not find food as good as this anywhere in the city, this is a must go too. David Burke himself frequently visited our table, explained food to us, how he prepared it and took photos with us not many places anywhere does a chef go out their way!The bacon appetizer is just as amazing as people say! The duck, duck, duck was great, though a little tough! The roasted chicken was the home run! Definitely recommend. The steamed lobster dumplings were  fantastic and a must try as well! Cane with a party of 8 for a birthday celebration and everybody enjoyed everything they had. David always has new twists old meals nothing is ever cookie cutter. Not only is the food delicious the presentation is always outstanding. Had a great time eating at David Burke Tavern with my family, they treat you like you're VIP, the atmosphere and the food is amazing, next time I'm in the city I'm definitely coming back!

I visited this establishment during Restaurant Week and it was beyond my expectations.The staff was very pleasant and attentive. They had a good amount of options during this RW. (Some restaurants are only have 3 choices for each course). The food was tastefully prepared and delivered in a timely manner.

3.0,3/5/2019,Came for lunch.  Ok... this place is still so conveniently located near Bloomingdales I'll  probably be back. Nice bar. However....  I won't get the chicken caesar salad again. Dry. I'm not gonna lie to you... the bartender was drier. Hard to get his attention. Wanted nothing to do with me or any of the others at the bar. I come to NYC to meet interesting people. Friendly bartenders are the secret to success. Not gonna find it here but again... Soooo close to bloomies. Bet you anything I'll be back. If it's still here.,0,0,0,Kassidy K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0
5.0,3/3/2019,"Went for my birthday during restaurant week.Service: service was efficient and friendly. They were very diligent when it came to filling water glasses.Cocktails: they make a good dirty martini. The old fashioned was just alright.Appetizers: the tuna crudo might have been the best thing I ate all night. Perfect balance of saltines, fat, and acidity, and the tuna was very fresh. My girlfriend enjoyed the burrata salad.Main course: the duck was cooked well and the sauce was delicious. My only critique of the dish is the thickness of the dumpling skin, especially where it was crimped at the top. My girlfriend ordered the chicken, which was moist with a crisp skin. The pistachio dumplings that came with it were delicious - very herb/fresh forwardDessert: the cheesecake lollipops were good. Nothing mind blowing, but good. The bubblegum whipped cream that came with it was very weird, and neither of us had too much of it. It wasn't bar, just very bubblegum-y and didn't seem to fit with everything else",1,0,0,Dan F.,"Ringwood, NJ",0,78,19
5.0,2/22/2019,"I made a surprised visit to the restaurant and I had the same server who remembered me. It was a very busy night. I wanted to try the duck dumplings for Chinese New Year good luck. The server said that these steamed dumplings usually come in 2 but they gave me an extra one, which was nice. The presentation was very nice. The dumplings were served steamed and it has a healthy bite to it, which was a bit unusual due to the type of duck. But, the best part of my visit was the Beets by Burke cocktail which was highly recommended by my server and it was bright and refreshing. The flavors and the juice to alcohol ratio was well balanced enough to enjoy the drink and get buzzed after dinner.",1,0,0,Chris P.,"ELMHURST, NY",91,53,182
3.0,2/12/2019,"I'll start off by saying - GREAT deal for restaurant week!  Busy ambiance, a bit of an older crowd, fairly loud and tables somewhat close together, but upscale tavern feel is still very enjoyable.The quality and taste of our food was very good (recommend the burrata and squash salad and the scallops and octopus entree), however, a few service components result in only 3 stars. 1) Having reviewed the wine list in advance, we were very excited to try Domaine Drouhin Pinot Noir - a great deal for $120 and a bottle that has been on our list to try!  We ordered and the waiter returned saying they did not have any, but recommended Flowers which was over $75 more expensive.  There was no cheaper alternative besides a $65 bottle which is questionable.  After this initial disappointment, the waiter also brought my boyfriend a second glass of the alternative red he ordered by the glass even though he answered he was ok for now. 2) The waiter did not seem educated on celiac / gluten allergies.  He said he would review the menu for ""starches,"" and further commented that the creme brulee was not gluten free (which is unlikely but also was not able to articulate why).Not rushing to get back, as prices also seem fairly high outside of restaurant week.",0,0,0,Michelle S.,"Manhattan, NY",121,61,43
5.0,2/12/2019,"Was in for restaurant week last week and had a very good time. Felt a little bamboozled at first that the clothesline bacon wasn't included on the restaurant week menu despite it being listed with the available appetizers. Either way, the food was very good including the Tuna Crudo (favorite) and the lobster dumplings. For entrees we got the pork chops and the duck. Both were very good and would order either one on a second visit. Prices are a little steep for their regular, non-restaurant week, menu but it's a nice place to try",0,0,0,Alex K.,"Manhattan, NY",118,5,1
2.0,2/8/2019,"Unfortunately, we had a very disappointing experience last night. We came during restaurant week, and the food was a mix of highs and lows, but the service was quite poor. Perhaps it was too hectic during the night, but we had to keep requesting for our waters to be filled and we waited a longggg time for any service (e.g., taking orders, getting our food, etc). The bread here also completely missed the mark... I've had better tasting dinner rolls on an airplane. They had different types of bread, but the server did not ask which we preferred. When I asked for the multi-grain one, he said okay but never brought it out.  Now to the food... I got the tuna crudo as an app and the branzino for entrée. Both were tasty... the branzino was cooked well, and still moist. The low came with the dessert. I LOVE crème brulee, and when I saw the online menu had pumpkin crème brulee as a dessert, I KNEW I had to get it. Lo and behold, they did not have pumpkin last night, and it was maple banana crème brulee. It was one of the worst creme brulee I've had... flavor was okay, but it was sooo sweet, with an inch-thick layer of sugar on top of mealy custard. I love dessert, and I could only take a few bites.Also, I made reservations and noted that we were celebrating our dad's birthday and to please write ""Happy Birthday""/add a candle for dessert. The occasion was never acknowledged and my dad did not a candle or anything... granted, I probably should have followed up at the restaurant. Just expected more from a nice restaurant. Even though the app and entrée were good, they were not OUTSTANDING and definitely did not make up for the lows of the meal. Needless to say, I will not be returning, and definitely not during restaurant week.",0,0,0,Kim L.,"New York, NY",0,6,0
5.0,2/5/2019,"My boyfriend & I stopped in for Restaurant Week. We went through many different restaurant options & decided on David Burke Tavern & we are so happy we did. For apps we started with the bacon, however, there was a supplemental charge but we didn't mind, we love bacon & we don't regret it. We also tried the scallop & chorizo kebab, OMGGGG so much FLAVOR. We also had the lobster dumpling & I was taken by surprise considering that I wasn't really expecting much but I was definitely surprised with how flavorful it was & the sauce complimented it so well. Our entrees were the branzino fish & my boy friend had the pork chop which I also tried  the best pork chop I've ever had. It was so tender & juicy.  What made the entire experience amazing was our waiter, his name Jon A. He was incredible from his knowledge of not just wines but other drinks as well, wine/drink pairings, we were blown away & also learned so much. We also had a kick out of Jon pointing out how we were a bit quiet when we first were seated but as we received our food our spirits lifted. We laughed because we had shared with him that we do intermittent fasting so we were very hungry! If you find yourself here I would definitely make sure that he's your waiter.

5.0,1/24/2019,"Probably the best ""Restaurant Week"" ever, and we've been doing Restaurant Week since it started! Probably?  No, DEFINITELY, the best Restaurant Week meal.  They have the full menu with very few supplements, and the regular portions, so not like most restaurants that participate in Restaurant Week where they give you small portions of the cheaper dishes.  But the scope of the menu and size of the portions is secondary, what's important was that the meal was spectacularly good!  Lobster dumplings and the duck entre, can't remember a meal I've enjoyed as much.   This form asks if we would recommend David Burke Tavern and I said yes, but really, it's much stronger than that, I would urge you to go, David Burke Tavern is as good as it gets!",1,0,1,Martin B.,"New York, NY",0,81,0

1.0,1/23/2019,"I was enjoying a wonderful evening celebrating my husbands birthday. We we're having drinks at the bar when suddenly a woman fell to the ground. She was in her late 70's and very shaken from the accident. My husband was the only person who helped this poor woman until I complained that no one in this restaurant offered to assist. Meanwhile David Burke sat in the corner  watching this occur. Once we were able to get this woman on a chair, David decided to stroll over and make an appearance to check on his customer. We now proceed to our table, not interested in partaking in restaurant week. After discovering that we are paying for a full meal, the waiter immediately changed his attitude and became very friendly. The entree that my husband ordered was not served in the proper dish so when he went to cut his pork chop the broth splattered all over his shirt and tie. The general mangers did not care at all. The attitude we received from the manager is not proper customer service.  I will never return to this restaurant. There are so many other better restaurants in NYC.

5.0,1/5/2019,"We had one of the best experiences at David Burkes.  The food was Ahhh-mazing!!  We order the special that night (pork skank) and the seared scallops.  Appetizer was a burrata with greens and pomegranate, nice and creamy!! Another reason why we rated 5 stars was because of our server, J'on, he was an absolute pleasure, always on point, friendly and just truly understood customer service.  He wasn't a server just trying to raise the average check he was there to provide the service to his customers.  He was honest and genuine, he was passionate and made the experience fun!!  When we were leaving the host asked us ""how was everything?"", we complimented on the food and J'on and she said that she already had multiple common comments that evening with our server.  Another big bonus is when Chef David came out to greet his customers....I truly enjoyed that so much being from the hospitality field myself!

3.0,1/3/2019,"I tried this place because of the reviews. I wanted a nice, high end meal with an inviting atmosphere. *Cue arrival* My boyfriend and I walk into the restaurant which puts you in the bar/lounge area. We checked in for our reservation which is past the bar, and sat at the bar for a pre dinner cocktail. At the bar... two bartenders on... the bar is more on the half empty side... NEITHER BARTENDER ACKNOWLEDGED US for TEN MINUTES. I don't know if we smelled or what because I have never felt more uncomfortable in a bar situation. We never ended up being greeted, so I said screw this and we asked the host if we could be seated early because the bartenders clearly did not want to serve us. LOLThe dining room is upstairs... Very cool atmosphere. Our server didn't really have much charisma, he was simply an order taker. I love going to high end establishments because I love to learn about dishes and cocktails I may not be familiar with. He was NOT a passionate person. The service all in all- below average.Moving on... appetizer (Angry Lobster Dumplings) WOW. The lobster was so fresh it melts in your mouth. I ate this dish so slow because I didn't want to stop eating it. The subtle heat from the glaze on the plate was a perfect combination of flavor.I ordered the Branzino. The skin on the fish was flaky and cooked perfectly. The fried artichoke on top was a great touch. I tried my boyfriends duck also... OUT OF THIS WORLD. We ordered a side of brussel sprouts as well, however his meal came with them. It would have been nice to know considering we would've ordered a different side. Service was definitely not anything to rave about- except the host and server assistant were hustling. The food was extraordinary!",2,0,2,Nicole F.,"Rochester, NY",11,64,49

Had Bloody Mary's and Bloody Maria's (tequila), as well a the brunch martini. The drinks were excellent. Had the Chicken and Waffles with hot honey. It was amazing. The branzino was also very good. The blueberry pancakes were excellent. The eggs that came with the crab cakes were over cooked and sent back. Replaced with burrata salad, which was also excellent. I would like to see some additional items on the brunch menu but overall it was excellent. Used to go every year to Bobby Flays Bar Americain for New Years but it closed last January.

Basically -- why are you here and what do you want...The food is presented well, but had smaller portions than I anticipated. The kitchen staff had pretty good execution despite the fact the food came out tepid at best.

3.0,11/14/2018,I liked the ambiance of the restaurant. Classy but very old fashion styled decor. Intimate setting so perfect for date night. We ordered the hanging clothing line bacon. It was a interesting a unique way to display the hanging candied bacon. It was good but a little too salty for my taste. My friend did enjoy it. I only had 1/2 of strip. I'm a huge fan of grilled octopus but the octopus chorizo skewer appetizer we ordered was so disappointing. It didn't have the chewy texture. It tasted as if it was way over cooked. My favorite part of the meal was the entree. I ordered the Duck breast with duck foie gras tart and sweet potato purée. It wasn't too heavy and it tasted delicious. The duck breast was so tender and cooked perfectly. The sweet potato purée was an interesting touch for the foie gras. I liked how it balanced the taste and flavors out. My friend got the lobster pasta squid ink pasta. Ingredients very fresh but I've had better squid ink. The sauce base was too tart for me. The brussel sprouts were tasty but not crispy enough on the outside. I wasn't a fan of the starters but I'll be back to try other entrees!,0,0,0,Kaienting T.,"New York, NY",38,79,109

To begin with the tables upstairs are well spaced and, unlike  so many of the ""in"" restaurants diners can have a conversation without having to scream across the table.And now  the food... Maybe I'm overly picky, but if the bread is not good, I am immediately just a little turned off. In this case two different warm rolls were served; both were unusual and outstanding. Our appetizer of pumpokin tortellini in sage butter was delectable. As for our main course, the salmon looked like a filet mignon; it was crisp on both top and bottom, and tender within. As for dessert, we shared a pumpkin crème brulee, delicately sprinkled with cranberries.This was the best meal I've had in a very long time.

4.0,11/1/2018,"Note: While the Yelp App says ""Tavern62 By David Burke"" - it was actually closed in September.  Reopened as David Burke Tavern with a similar yet updated menu.  So this review is for my dining experience at David Burke Tavern, 10/25/18.  Overall, 3.5 stars for the dining but I'm rounding to 4 as our service was great!My buddy and I decided to go light on dinner entrees so we could try more of the menu items.  Too bad I have a shrimp allergy; I was not able to try the lobster dumplings nor the crab cakes (just in case).  I mentioned my allergy so the waiter steered me clear to be safe.For starters, we opted for the mushroom Mac and Cheese. No surprise, it was creamy and delicious. There were two tasty surprises in this dish - olives (crumbled) and chorizo (bits) -- I didn't know how the elements would work together.  To our surprise, it worked very well, all of the flavors blended seamlessly.  This is a must try if you're a mac & cheese fan.For our entree, we shared the roasted scallops and octopus.  The octopus was very salty.  I think they got too heavy handed with seasoning it - and very unnecessary since Octopus has a light taste naturally, just leave it be. The scallops were delish...cooked perfectly and had a beautiful sear.  It went well with the tomatoes and capers.  It was served with Jalapeno's as well but I picked it out after one taste.  We also tried three sides to complete our meal.  (It was economically priced at 3 for $25).  First the creamy spinach and leek. I would've wanted a little more leek flavor (yes it was subtle); the creamy spinach was fine.  The second side, the hipster fries w/ bacon, were very good; well seasoned and had bacon pieces to boot.  We waited too long to enjoy them though.  Given all the sides arrived with the entree at the same time, we had to choose what to eat first.  So the fries would have been great right when it came out - not their fault, it was my fault eating it later.  The third side we had were the brussels sprouts with horseradish sour cream.  I totally recommend this one.  Any place that makes a good brussels sprout dish is a plus in my book.  Onto the dessert - we both had mixed feelings on this one.  It was called the Baked Alaska (intended for 2).  On the one hand, I was excited to try this combo - red velvet, vanilla ice cream, and bananas foster.  Three desserts that I like, just not sure if it was executed right.  The dessert presentation was fun (see my photo of the dessert on fire...blue flame was cool).  The fire gave the dessert a charred ""s'more"" look on the top.  I tasted and saw the red velvet but the bananas foster was like frozen inside with the ice cream.  It was a huge ball of something - tasted the bananas but it seemed too frozen.  Not sure if that was meant to be that way.  Skip this.  David Burke is actually well known for his cheesecake lollipops but both of us are not big on cheesecake.  I kinda wished I opted for that instead.  Overall a good dining service throughout the evening!  Try the ""cricket cocktail"" - I forgot the name.  (Yes, I took a pic...there's like 5 crickets in my drink).  It was quite a drink...great for storytelling.  LOLWahh!  I so miss ""Fishtail"", the former David Burke restaurant that was located in this same Townhouse space.  But, I was still excited to try David Burke Tavern, since I'm a fan.",8,2,6,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7611

2.0,8/21/2018,"I've had better. Came here for Restaurant Week with hubby on Friday night at 8pm. Made a reservation easily on OpenTable a couple weeks in advance. Perhaps one of the best things about Tavern62 is that they have a generous restaurant week menu where mostly everything is available and that some items require a supplement which is a standard practice.  Perhaps the bad thing about this is that they must have had amateur night in the kitchen, because everything was cooked terribly. To start, the amuse was a watermelon gazpacho - standard but it was infused with some kind of hot oil so it wasn't really cooling or cleansing.  I had the lobster dumpling to start. It was fine but didn't taste much chunks of lobster in the four dumplings. The complimentary bread (cranberry raisin) with butter and pickled veggies were good though. My husband got the pretzel crab cake which I swear they changed over the years. Instead of lump generous crab the cake tasted like a chicken or tuna salad. The pretzel shell didn't work anymore, just got kind of wet. I remembered being wowed before but not this time.The mains is where it really went wrong. I had the chicken, which came with a yummy pistachio pea pesto chimichurri and ravioli (one lol) but the chicken was horribly overcooked. Hard, not juicy with a luscious salty chicken skin which is what you come to expect if the menu price tag is $36 Hubby ordered the short rib with bbq shrimp. That was fine but even still parts of the ribs were chewy. How was that possible with ribs... polenta was good though. Dessert might have been one of the worst parts of the night food-wise. We paid up to get the Baked Alaska - I know this could vary because everyone's baked is different. There was cake, no ice cream and a yummy mixed berry sauce. But what was universal is that you light it on fire and infuse it with Grand Mariner or some kind of flavored liqueur. Firstly - this was some straight up moonshine they used. Secondly - we shouldn't even taste much of the alcohol - but the waiter did not let it burn off long enough and they used too much alcohol.  The end of the dessert was simply a pool of disgusting alcohol, it drowned out any sort of flavor the rest of the dessert had. On the bright side, we had some great glasses of wine. I had a traditional peppery Pinot Noir, and my hubs had a rich California Cab. The server went out of the way to mention they were doing a wine auction that night where we could buy any bottle for some discounted price. He spent more time doing that rather than making detailed food recommendations that didn't feel rushed.  In fact, the entire dinner felt rushed. Not sure if they were going through the motions or understated. We did get a nice corner table though so props to the hosts.What's worst is that he incorrectly ran our check at first (We didn't even check), then we had to wait forever for the correct check to be processed.  There just was not a lot of care in that night's service.Not what I come to expect food and service wise from a premium restaurant, won't be dining with David Burke again. I hate to write such things, but it's better to send some hopefully helpful feedback so they can keep a check on their operations. I hope it was just an off night but not worth while coming back.",5,2,2,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25
4.0,8/18/2018,"Overall good food. We went for restaurant week and were able to try their regular menu items. For appetizers we had the dumplings which were amazing and the crab cakes which weren't anything special. For our entrees, we shared the branzino (very light and well seasoned), bison short ribs (very tender), scallops (average) and salmon (underwhelming). Although the food was good, the dessert was nothing special. My least favorite was the strawberry panna cotta, it was basically thick liquid. The creme brûlée was cold (including the top). Baked Alaska was essentially overly sweet fluff. The lollipop tree is an interesting concept but not a great dessert. The apple tart was probably the best out of all of them. Our server was extremely awkward and snarky which made our whole dinner experience uncomfortable.",0,0,0,Amal S.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",2,40,10

5.0,7/4/2018,"I love David Burke....his food, his restaurants, his personality, everything. I have never had an unsatisfactory meal or sub-par service at any of his restaurants. Therefore, when a few of my chef friends suggested we check out Tavern62, I was thrilled. The ambiance is very classy, upscale, and sophisticated, so 'Upper East Side'; yet there's a feeling of comfort and homeliness in the restaurant as well. The downstairs has a bar with low copper ceilings and booth seating. We sat in the upstairs dining area which resembled a gentleman's library with red leather chair booths, mahogany tables, and chairs, navy colored walls, and a beautiful book alcove carved into the walls. We started with their east coast oysters and clothesline bacon, which came with strips of maple bacon hanging from clothespins on a little stand. It was easily one of the coolest plates I have ever seen. After that, we ordered tuna tartare with mango and avocado and angry lobster dumplings. They were both delicious. The angry lobster dumplings came 4 to a dish and had little lobster claws coming out of the dumping. (These lobsters are so angry!) Then we had the asparagus, burrata, and prosciutto salad, which was perfect for the summer. The watermelon paired nicely with the balsamic and burrata. After that, we pretty much went to town and ordered everything on the menu. Highlights included:*Slow roasted chicken: excellent dish, the chicken was very juicy and roasted to perfection and the skin was so flavorful. The dish came over carrots and snap peas and three dumplings on the side. *Wild mushroom cavatelli: a nice and creamy pasta dish with peas, asparagus and pecorino cheese with a dallop of black truffle mousse on top (I asked for extra cheese on the side and was given a small bowl of freshly grated cheese, delish). *Their Monday evening special: green market special: red snapper. They came out and showed us the whole fish cooking in salt before they brought us the dish. Nice and light with veggies on the side. Perfect for summer. *34 oz Porterhouse (bone in): I wish I could say I eat red meat, but I don't. However, my crew went at this dish. It was huge, but you bet your butt we finished the entire thing! Side dishes: creamy spinach and leeks and asparagus with parmesan and truffle. Both were excellent. I absolutely loved the creamy spinach.Dessert: so many excellent desserts here! *Sorbets and fresh fruit: excellent summer dish, it came with two scoops of different types of sorbet, fresh strawberries, and blueberries with whipped cream on top. *Creme brulee: a staple dish. Very tasty. *Cheesecake lollipop tree: eight delicious lollipops: both vanilla and chocolate. *Chocolate waffle lava cake: this dish made me think of fresh waffles down the shore or at a street market, it was such a unique tasty dish. Two fresh waffles with whipped cream in the middle, two scoops of ice cream on the top, and blueberries and strawberries on the side. You think you're in Coney Island with this dessert!

4.0,2/25/2018,"Delicious food. Came for restaurant week. Made reservations which was very easy and got seated promptly once arrived to restaurant. For appetizer I had the bacon which is basically two thick cut strips of bacon that come on a clothesline and they give you a pair of scissors to cut the pieces to eat. The texture is like a jerky and the outside is candied so it's sweet and salty. It was delicious however portion is HUGE for one person. I basically shared with 3 people and it was still more than enough. Next I had the short ribs with polenta as my main meal. Polenta was delicious. Short ribs were soft and juicy however the sauce was a tad bit salty for my taste. For dessert, I had the cheesecake tree. The bubble gum whipped cream is interesting but I liked it. The outside of the cheesecake pops were a bit too sweet so I just ate the inside of it. My friend had the creme brûlée and that was so good.

2.0,2/9/2018,"I went here for Restaurant Week dinner with my bf and two other friends. When we all showed up, well before 6:45, we were told that our table would be ready by 6:45. We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for our reservation and were finally seated at 7:05. I was, by this time, pretty unimpressed but still willing to keep an open mind. The service was decent and friendly. I was disappointed with the disparity in serving sizes. For appetizers, we ordered clothesline candied bacon, tuna tartare, octopus & chorizo kebabs, and pretzel crusted crab cake. The bacon was the star, both visually and taste-wise. It tastes and feels rather like sweet jerky and was super filling. The tuna tartare was quite good and so was the crab cake (but much more difficult to eat as the pretzel crust was composed of pretzel sticks lined up in a row). I was disappointed with the kebabs: only two sticks of small pieces of meat, placed in a wooden block to make it seem like much more than it really was, and super oily which made it unpleasant to eat. For mains, we ordered two black rigatoni with lobster/shrimp/calamari, roasted duck breast, and bison short rib. The rigatoni was the agreed-upon favorite. The duck breast was quite good, although the pie wasn't immediately recognizable as containing anything on speaking terms with foie gras. My friend regretted his choice of short rib which contained only 1 prawn (menu said prawnS?) and a small unsatisfying rib. Talk of a post-meal McDonald's began to drift around the table.Two creme brulees were ordered, each with a single cookie (evidently, the menu writer(s) have issues with counting as the menu promised cookieS). They were, however, quite good. The caramelized apple tart was even better and and came with a tiny, vicious-looking knife for cutting. I was sorely disappointed with my choice of sorbet with fresh fruit. The lychee and mango sorbets were delicious but the promised fresh fruit consisted of small chopped fruit that were definitely not fresh but also definitely came from a can (your regular clientele may not be basic enough to recognize what canned pineapple tastes like, Tavern62, but I definitely am.)I feel a bit bad for this review as it was actually a fairly decent meal.

The $45 pre fix was an amazing deal!Peanut brittle: while you are waiting to be seated, you can munch on some AMAZING homemade peanut brittle. Thank god we go seated quickly or I would've just filled up on the brittle.Appetizer: I got the lobster dumplings. I'd say the flavor was above average but wasn't in love with the execution. It tasted great, but they have a lobster shell sticking out of the top (attached to the lobster meat in the dumpling). It made eating the dish a bit awkward. I'm usually a proponent that everything on the plate should be edible.Entree: was hoping to get the Bison short rib, but they were unfortunately out. I elected, instead, for the 7oz filet on a mushroom risotto. I have nothing negative to say about this dish and could eat it every day. My filet was a perfect medium, super tender, and needed no extra seasoning. The mushroom risotto was also incredible and stood out even next to the filet.Dessert: we got the cheesecake lollipops. The presentation was playful and the lollipops were a delicious and sweet bite for dessert.

4.0,2/6/2018,"Went here with a friend to check this place out for Restaurant week.We decided to split every course so that we could try more of the menu:Candied bacon (5 stars): All the hype about this dish is real. From the presentation to the flavors, everything about this dish is spectacular.Tuna tartare (4.5 stars): This was also a great dish as the tuna was super fresh and paired nicely with the mango and yuzu.Bison short rib (4 stars): The short rib was good--but not as tasty as some  of the classic beef short ribs I've had in the city. On the other hand, the polenta was so creamy and delicious--some of the best I've had.Peking pork shank (3.5 stars): This dish was a little bit challenging to eat being that it's fried and includes a lot of fat. Some of the flavors were there, but the meat was a bit underwhelming overall. Despite that, the fried rice it was served with was delicious, as the taste and chewiness of it really elevated the dish.Creme brulee (4 stars): This dessert was a decent take on a classic. The eggyness and sweetness was there and the fruit on top was a nice touch.Apple tart (3.5 stars): They were out of the panna cotta, so we went with this dish. The tart itself was decent--but nothing out of the ordinary flavor-wise. The cinnamon ice cream on top was very tasty, though I could have used another scoop.Overall, this place has to be the best restaurant week destinations in terms of value. The whole menu is available to be ordered and all of the portion sizes mirror the restaurant's regular dishes. The appetizers were definitely my favorite course, but each dish had at least one component that was excellent. Service was friendly and attentive and food came out at a good pace.

1.0,2/5/2018,"I want to start with we had reservations for 8 for dinner on Saturday 2/3. We are all foodies. I called the prior Saturday night to inquire if Tavern 62 was participating in Restaurant week on Saturday night.  The hostess stated yes, then placed me on hold to verify with the manager and when she returned she again stated yes but that the menu may not have ALL the selections as posted on Tavern 62 website as their restaurant week menu.When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by 2 lovely hostess.  We were brought to our table which was set for only 7 people which was now awkward as we stood around trying to figure out what was happening.  I hailed a waiter who stated the reservation said party of 7. I smiled and informed him I called to confirm and it was 8 as we were 8 people standing in the middle of the room.  The 8th setting and a chair was brought to the table.  Once seated the waiter brought the menus.  I asked for the restaurant week menu. He stated that they are NOT participating in Restaurant week tonight.  I told the waiter that I called last week to inquire about the menu for this evening and was assured that Tavern 62 was offering the restaurant week menu. The waiter left and returned with a very skimpy menu with a couple of selections for each of the 3 courses.  Well, I must say that the hostess on the phone understated dramatically when she said that they may not have ALL the selections as posted on Tavern 62 website as their restaurant week menu. So as for our party of 8 only 3 people decided to go with the skimpy limited menu selections and the other 5 in our party ordered from the regular menu.Now to the food, Open Tables and Yelp speak about a special bread and dip that the restaurant serves. We did not see that but instead were given what appeared to be a store bought loaf overly toasted with some butter.  Several of the appetizers were tasty but the Little Gem and Beet salad was ""Little"" with just a couple of tiny pieces of beet. For ($17) one might expect a normal size salad with the ingredients listed included in the salad. The Lobster bisque (cup) was more of a tomato broth base with a hint of pepper and 3 croutons. The Cesar Salad ($17) was bland at best.  For the main course 2 of our party had the Scallop special ($39).  This small appetizer sized dish came with 3 scallops ($13) each for dinner. It could not have even been 1/4 lb of Scallop. The Slow Roasted Chicken was undercooked and red and a bit bloody in the center. Most of this was left over by the diner. The bottles of wine and beer that we had were very nice and they have a good selection to choose from.My husband and I had invited our group for dinner and although the company was great the food was not what we had expected. The next day we received a call from one of our guests again thanking us for a great evening. She again commented about the skimpy 3 scallop main course dish for $39 and although the dish was tasty it seemed very small for a main dish and much of the evening had left her with a bad taste. She stated that she would not recommend this restaurant to friends and she and her husband would probably not return.",1,0,0,Suzane P.,"Stamford, CT",0,1,0
4.0,2/5/2018,"I came here with my sister and mom for restaurant week. We got there about 15 minutes before our reservation so we sat at the bar for a drink until we could get seated. The bartender was friendly and recommended several drinks to get us started. My sister got the Bourbon Smash and my mom got something with beets in the name? Both were very good with a good amount of alcohol in them.  My one star that I took off from my rating was from the service. We arrived before our reservation so we decided to wait at the bar while having a drink. It had been over 15 minutes since we had been waiting so I went to the hostess to see if our table was ready. She ignored me and went over to the bar to tell my sister that our table was ready. I don't know if she was trying to be courteous so as to not make me walk back to the bar? We were finally seated about 10 mins past our reservation. I had also put in the comments that it was a birthday celebration and none of the hostesses ever followed up on that. Other than that, the rest of the night went well. The food was amazing. Restaurant week offered a list of wines for $55 a bottle so we opted for that. For appetizers, we had the lobster bisque (great! my sister loved the lobster chunks they included in the meal), the beet salad (my mom loves beets!), and the smoked salmon (went really well with the small arugula salad on top of it). For mains, we had the seafood rigatoni, bison short rib, and the duck breast. They were all so good! The rigatoni included a small lobster tail on top. The polenta that came with the short rib went really well together. I thought the meat was a little gamey, but both my mom and sister didn't find it a problem. The duck and foie gras just melted in my mouth! To finish it all off, we had sorbet, apple tart and creme brûlée. Creme brûlée is always my favorite, but if I had to choose one, the sorbet would be favorite here. The sorbet came with two different flavors with little pieces of fruit at the bottom.

I came for restaurant week and tried - lobster dumplings (came with 2)- octopus and chorizo skewers (came with 2)-short rib with a shrimp and polenta (polenta was so rich and flavorful!)-Peking pork shank (super tasty but don't get it if you don't like a lot of fat..oh and fried rice wasn't the BEST) --panna cotta and -creme bruleee. At the beginning of the meal they also serve you complementary pickled carrots, lightly toasted raisin? bread, and small profiteroles with herbed butter ( soooo good). I would recommend!

Crispy, salty, garlicky and just so delicious.  I had the bison for dinner which melted in your mouth and the polenta was a great complement to the dish.  For dessert I had the Butterscotch Panna Cotta which wasn't bad but I tasted the Creme Brûlée and wish I got that instead.  Our friends ordered the cheesecake pops and said they were good but the whipped cream on the side tasted like bubblegum and was not very good.  Overall, I'm glad we got to try it.. a little pricey for what we got but hey, that's NYC for you.

It sounded crazy but I love beets, so I obviously had to try it- it was amazing!  Also sitting at the bar was a lovely patron who we had a great time chatting with- so friendly! I love sitting at the bar and meeting new people.  (thanks for being so fun, susan!!)Moving onto dinner.  We shared a bottle of wine to start; the restaurant had special RW wine bottle deals which was great.  For appetizers, we had the beet salad (I wasn't kidding, I LOVE beets), the soup of the day (cauliflower with tempura rock shrimp), pretzel crusted crab cake, and caesar salad.  Everything was so good.  I think the soup might have been the favorite. For main courses, we had the bison short rib, filet mignon, black rigatoni, and scallops of the day (I forgot how they were prepared that day).  I personally thought the short rib was the star- it was so tender and not at all gamey.  The polenta it was served with was fantastic.  everyone enjoyed all of the entrees as well.  We got 3 a la carte sides to add on- broccoli, brussel sprouts, and French fries.  Again, all very good.For dessert we had the crème brulee and the cheesecake tower.  I think we all unanimously enjoyed the crème brulee more, however the cheesecake pops were good as well.also- at the beginning of the meal, they brought out an amuse bouche which was an herbed bread.  They also served mint marshmallows at the end of the meal.  I loved that even with RW, you got the same level of great service. Service was very good, everyone was friendly.  The presentation for every course was unique and exciting.  I had also mentioned in the open table reservation that it was someone's birthday in our party.  When the cheesecake tower arrived, there was 'happy birthday' written on it with candles.  I love when restaurants add these special touches.  I'm so glad we were able to come here for restaurant week to try so many items.  I'll definitely be back!",0,0,2,Laura M.,"New York, NY",119,145,26

5.0,1/26/2018,"I decided to come here during restaurant week because their RW menu looked very similar to their regular menu, which is usually a good sign. Clothesline candied bacon - okay it takes a lot for bacon to impress me but this was amazing. It was perfectly candied without being too sweet, but still savory and delicious. Some of the pieces were too fatty for me, and I felt like my arteries clogged up after eating this, but in the words of my husband - ""worth it"". Angry lobster dumplings - while the bacon was a huge portion (3 generous strips), this appetizer came with two measly dumplings. I didn't even taste any lobster, and the sauce was just okay. I would not order this againBison short rib - the meat tasted very much like beef. My husband thought it was a little gamey, but I hardly noticed it. The meat fell right off the bone! The sauce was great, and I wish there was more of it. The shrimp was my favorite part of the dish, but there was only one piece, and it left me wanting more. The polenta paired nicely with the dish, kind of like shrimp and grits. Lastly, I really wish this dish came with some vegetables to round out the meal. Black rigatoni with lobster, shrimp, and calamari - this was surprisingly the highlight of our meal. I don't normally order pasta when I go out, but this dish was such a delight. I couldn't stop raving on how perfectly chewy the pasta was! It came topped with a whole lobster tail plus several pieces of lobster, shrimp, and loads of calamari. The sauce had a nice kick to it, but wasn't too spicy for me - and overall very tasty even for someone who does not usually love red sauce. Duo sorbet and mixed fruit - I asked the waiter what the flavors of the sorbet were, and he said mango and raspberry. I love mango so I ordered it. The ""mango"" sorbet was white and tasted extremely sour and was definitely not mango. The raspberry was not bad. The mixed fruit was refreshing, but it was drenched in a sweet syrup/juice. Would not order this again.Creme brûlée - this was one solid creme brûlée. We ate the whole thing and wanted seconds. The description said it would come with butter cookies but it came with one single tiny cookie lol. We were disappointed that the dessert options did not come with a chocolate or cake choice, but we really enjoyed the creme brûlée. Overall, the food was on point and the service was great. One thing I didn't like was their seating arrangement for groups of two. You sit next to your partner instead of across from, and you are facing the bar, where it's a bit loud. Next time, I would ask to be seated upstairs.",3,0,0,Lina Y.,"Flushing, NY",156,96,90

I came in and to be honest with you the happy hour wasn't that ""happy"" I ordered oysters & the oysters came out very dry inside and lacking that natural liquor that they are supposed to be swimming in. They just looked tired and not fresh. Now to the burger, it was over cooked and lacked flavor BIGTIME and just overall not good, maybe needed more salt and pepper and less time on the grill due to it being over cooked. Something that really bothered me was about where I was sitting. It was towards the end of the bar where the staircase is and servers come pick up drinks. It was a bit annoying listening to the servers gossip & talk about the chef / cook or whatever happened in the kitchen recently and learned that the chef / cook had quit or ""had enough"" of Burkes antics. I honestly don't want to hear workers bitch & moan about their jobs or work related stuff especially on the floor where patrons can hear. It just makes it that much more unpleasant for people like me to hear stuff like this. Companies like this should have a human resources office for workers to vent to if they need to get something off their chest. I also went to go use the bathroom and i looked into the kitchen while waiting for one of the bathrooms to open up and noticed all this smoke in there. It was crazy to see all this smoke in there and a cook battling the grill with that burger. Then it hit me! thats why my burger wasn't good, he couldn't even see it!!  Anyway, glad i didn't pay full price because i won't be back. Good luck.",0,0,0,Richard G.,"New York, NY",0,13,6

The best part of poached eggs would be the runny eggs... these eggs did not run. Solid and cold. Clothesline bacon as an appetizer not appetizing and cold and came late after the appetizer course. And nothing to cut it with nor plates to eat on. Fries soggy. Crabcake Benedict was served deconstructed and dry. Chicken and burnt waffles. Branzino was too fishy tasting and bland. I expected the servers would come around and ask us for more drinks. Did not happen and this group loves to drink. Too bad.We sat here for two hours and no asking for extra drinks.

For starters, we ordered the candied bacon, which was served dangling from a mini clothesline (see pics from other reviews) with some smoldering rosemary and a pickle on the side. The bacon was lightly sweet, perfectly chewy, and the fat just melted in your mouth---soo good. The group was also served complimentary breadsticks in wasabi oil (basically savory Pocky) and toasted whole grain raisin-nut bread. For my main, I got the black spaghetti with lobster, calamari, and crab; a side of brussel sprouts; and a glass of pinot noir. Everything was excellent. All the seafood tasted very fresh, the black spaghetti had a pleasant texture with just the right amount of tooth, and the tomato-vegetable sauce was quite good.

When the food arrive, he picked at the black octopus ink pasta with suspicion- kind of funny, really! I think it is a really neat idea to upgrade the common Mac & Cheese. He ended up loving it and is now eating the left over. I had an absolutely amazing seafood with octopus ink spaghetti. Hubby had a out of this world Asian inspired pork over rice dish. It was a nice moment when Chef Burke made an appearance in the dinning room. Seeing him make us feel like he cares about his patrons and his food! The price is reasonable too for the quality you get. The service was fantastic too!! The only bad thing is that it is very noisy. I bet if they change the ceiling, it would help.

When I asked the waitress what was taking so long she said it takes 45 minutes to make the steak which makes no sense. They  gave us a free appetizer because we were waiting so long. When it finally arrived it was room temperature and had a spongy texture with no crust like you get in most steak houses or do yourself at home. I should have sent it back and just cancelled it.

It was 8:00 and if we couldn't get a drink, and we now were forced into a rush, we had to go somewhere else.

No...I've literally been sitting in front of you and 4 others for 20 minutes with literally zero service.

Our server, Patrick, made the entire meal enjoyable - he was very helpful in recommending wine to go with the Duck, Duck, Duck dish, and pointed out the popular and unique dishes on the menu. He also suggested desserts when we couldn't decide on our own - overall very glad we got seated in his section. I started with the pretzel crab cake, which was delicious - highly recommend! I then had the NY strip, which was excellent. The salt and crust on the steak was particularly good (must be that Himalayan salt slab room it is aged in!), and the sides we ordered went very well with it. Other dishes that were ordered: mango and shrimp salad, soft shell crab, Peking pork shank, coconut banana pie, and apple tart. Everything that was ordered was enjoyed. The atmosphere was perfectly set - the booth-lined walls felt much more stylish than anyone would expect of the UES. We sat upstairs in one of the booths, and it made for a lovely meal. There was a party of eight that took up the volume a few notches, but it was unavoidable. That was the only damper on the evening, but that was out of the restaurant's power.

The grapefruit and orange supremes weren't necessary and the entire dish was greasy.Lobster dumpling: doughy and the ""spicy"" sauce was one note/not spicy.  The dumpling flavor was overloaded with basil and lemongrass, barely tasted any lobster.Brussels sprouts: drenched in oil and the bacon tasted fine but it was soggy and not crispy.Burger: for $27 a burger better be out of this world. It wasn't.  It was very small, not flavorful, overpowered by the same spicy mayo from the crab cake and one would think have more than just a slice of cheese. The coleslaw was inedible and had two useless shrimp. The fries were fine but lukewarm.My husband who eats all could not even finish his meal.

1.0,12/2/2016,"Well, because my husband is a much nicer person than I am, he attempted to reach out to the restaurant (via email through their website) to discuss our concerns before posting anything publicly. After a week with no response, I decided it was time to share our experience. Our waiter came over to greet us and let us know that he had worked at Serafina for years before coming here. I wasn't sure why the resume was necessary, but, off we go. He proceeded to hand us a wine list and return to serving other tables. I realized, very quickly, that the list was only bottles. My husband was planning on drinking liquor and I really only wanted a glass. I called him over and asked if they have a list of wines by the glass. ""Yea, we have Cabernet, Pinot Noir and Bordeaux"". Did I specify that I wanted red wine, you ask? No. But, alas, that was what I wanted. I describe the type of wine I like and he responds that he will bring something over. He brings something, I say I do not love it, he replies ""Well, why don't you think about it for a few minutes."" Ten minutes later, without his voluntary return, I ask for a glass of cabernet, assuming it will be tolerable. I then ask him if he can help my husband who is thinking of drinking bourbon. Does he have a list of liquor or beer? He says, yes, what would you like? My husband says, ""you know what, I'll just have a Jameson."" Waiter replies- ""that's not bourbon!"" Right. Next come the specials. He tells us there is a special truffle pizza on the menu that is only there since thanksgiving and will be gone soon. It is out of this world! I ask, how much is the truffle pizza? He says, "" you need to get it, it is so good, you don't believe me? hold on"" and proceeds to bring a truffle over and shave a piece on my plate. I say, thank you, but I want to know how much the pizza is. ""It is $30"". Okay, we'll have that. We usually order two appetizers but, since we went for the truffle pizza, we decide one is good enough. We order that and a burger and steak. Burger - ""would you like that medium rare?"" I very clearly reply NO, Medium WELL. He repeats it back to me. ""Okay! Medium Well!""The ""truffle pizza"" arrives and is actually the mushroom pizza ($18) that is listed on the menu with truffle shaved on top. Okay, for $12 extra, I guess we'll accept the deception of a ""special pizza"" because of the truffle supplement.The dinner arrives, medium RARE burger, under seasoned steak. The burger was, in fact, delicious, as were the fries. All other food was mediocre. Then, it's time for the bill! My husband and I enjoy a good ""guess the check"" game before looking. And, I HATE losing. Why did I lose? Well, the random, not very good, glass of wine I ordered (without any option for a wine glass list) was $23. And, we were charged for a mushroom pizza ($18) plus truffles ($30). I call over the waiter and say, excuse me, I asked how much the truffle pizza was and you told me it was $30. He says, ""oh, no that is the extra charge for the pizza! That's okay, right?""  I say, ""no, it's not okay, you clearly told us it was $30. But I'm not sure what to do about that now"" He says, ""Oh, yea, okay!""There was no attempt to rectify the situation. I do not expect a free meal. I don't even expect a free pizza. But, the pizza should have been charged at the quoted price. And, with all the other ridiculous mistakes that went on, there should have at least been some attempt at an apology after my husband contacted the restaurant directly.

Staff took wine glasses away before it was finished.- we were ripped off by a truffle garnish suggested by the waitstaff for some of the dishes. It was implied that it was a garnish that came with the dish. Guess what... they socked us with a $30/per person extra charge for it in the bill. That was what equal to a cost of an entire dish for 2-3 shreds of truffle that was so minimal that it did nothing to enhance the flavor. That alone spoiled what could have been a 4-5 star meal. Atleast they should have told us. We were not happy but didn't complain since it was a company sponsored meal, but I am hesitant to come again on my own dime.

1.0,11/7/2016,"Over-rated.  Sanctimonious.  Over-priced.The interior is beautiful. Unfortunately, neither the service nor the food lived up the promise.The very fact that this restaurant had to use the 'David Burke' brand in order to attract clientele was a warning I should have heeded.Enough said.",1,2,0,David M.,"Portland, OR",0,7,0
4.0,11/4/2016,"I'm STILL ooh-ing and aah-ing over the ""clothesline"" bacon and thinking about how when it came was delivered to our table everyone else just gawked in jealousy. What a cool restaurant. Though the name Tavern is in the title, it really was nothing like a tavern I'd ever been to. Hard to have that casual, low-end tavern feel on the upper east side on 62nd St. between Lexington & Park. Not so much of a low end area, if you know what I mean. And the prices here were certainly not ""tavern"" prices. The downstairs bar is eclectic and intimate with an open upstairs with a bustling number of tables, an insane number of waiters and bus boys all working very hard. My friends and I arrived on time and were promptly seated for our 7:30 reservation. The place was crowded, but no one seemed to be waiting for a table. We ordered a bottle of wine and perused the menu (although we came on a mission for burger night to try the Tavern burger). The bread service was presented beautifully too and was really delicious. It was a half plain-half cinn raisin swirl bread crisp served with butter on a piece of rock salt & a sweet pepper jam. Mmm! We ordered the ""clothesline"" candied bacon, and OH. MY. GOODNESS. It was so decadent and amazing, thick cut, candied and peppered to perfection. The presentation was pure genius, and served with a giant dill pickle and a pair of scissors was amazing. My friends and I shared 2 tavern burgers, with the rock shrimp coleslaw and fries, and a side of Brussel sprouts. The burgers were big, and served on a toasted, larger than average English muffin. Again, everything was presented beautifully, and the fries were in a little tin wrapped in paper to resemble a chef's hat. Loved it. The burger was good. I wasn't mind blown and it will not be topping my list as best burger in NYC. The flavor was just not there for me. The service was pretty impeccable, I really liked that the chef showed face and walked around making sure everything was good. I definitely want to come back here, and order some other items from the excellent looking menu!",3,0,1,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",480,227,524
2.0,11/1/2016,"Dinner Friday at 7:30. Took forever for waitress to acknowledge we were sitting, got the drink order wrong and did not check on us to order food. Food was pretty good. A-B+. Coffee was served without milk and coffee was literally cold. Desserts were also ordered. After searching for waitress re the cold coffee, another coffee was brought which was only warm. Ten mins later we got the sorry for dessert delay and it will be a other 2 mins. Manager comes over after 5 mins to say it will be delivered in 2 mins. Major staff and service changes are needed",3,3,1,Jeffrey G.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",1,10,0

5.0,10/22/2016,Dave Burke is back. In the old Fishtail location Dave has done it again. The man is very innovative with menu items and all items my wife and I had were excellent. Walk to central park and it will be a day to remember.,1,0,0,Mike E.,"Hazlet, NJ",0,10,0

Townhouse style with an open kitchen in rear, I had an impromptu dinner here.Ate:Whole roasted Branzino with charred broccolini w/ Veracuz sauce $33The bread service here is a knockout- round Boston brown and jalapeño corn bread with tomato chile jam.The Branzino was delish. Crispy skin, the charred broccolini and sauce were a perfect combo. Desserts looked ridiculous for the next time!",4,0,2,Franny A.,"New York, NY",865,1322,1125
5.0,10/10/2016,"What else can one say?  David Burke...an absolutely amazing dining experience!   If I could give it 6 stars I would.  From the friendly staff to the insane menu...absolutely loved it! I had the Skirt steak, which was ridiculous and my wife had the Tuna Steak which was fantastic.  We started with the Naked Oysters, Tuna Poke and Angry Lobster Scramble (yes, 3 apps) and again, amazing.  Congrats to David and his team...this place is special!",1,0,0,TK 1.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
