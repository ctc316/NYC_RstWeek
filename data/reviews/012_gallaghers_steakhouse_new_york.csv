4.0,4/30/2019,Oldie but goodie still executing well.  Probably one of the better lunchtime midtown spots.  Plentiful menu options available that that don't make you regret not ordering steak.  Cocktails mixed with precision so make sure to have one or some.,2,1,3,Ben D.,"South Orange, NJ",85,224,1447

1.0,4/26/2019,"We went to Gallagher's steakhouse 228 west 52nd street on our 10 year anniversary after a play. It was around 10 PM and we asked to be seated for dessert. The Hostest asked the manager what to do and he said sit at the bar! I asked if their were seats and he said go look and pointed to the bar. After walking around the bar area and seeing that they had no seats we aproached the Hostess and said, to bad she would not serve us and left. I wish I could say how the food was but never had a chance. Thumbs down, very rude and would not ever go back. Gallagher's was Recommend buy the Hilton and we will make sure they know as well.  After, we went to Rosie O'Gradys where we were welcomed with open arms and had a great dessert.",0,0,0,Robert F.,"Naval Air Station Point Mugu, CA",0,2,0
5.0,4/25/2019,"My New York City visit is incomplete without a visit to Gallagher's. This time I went with family on Easter Friday for lunch. We elected to go for 3 course fare for $29 PP. Some restaurants will compromise on portions and quality to provide cheap meal, like during summerlicious and winterlicious. Not Gallagher. The restaurant takes pride in its brand. Same quality, same service, same ambience. Gallagher is one of the best restaurants in NYC. I reserve my compliments for the likes of Gallagher, Jean George's, Le Coucou, Avra and Milos. There are many others of course amongst my favourites but for now, the above mentioned deserve culinary kudos. CheersSuresh ChawlaToronto, Canada.",0,0,0,Suresh C.,"Toronto, Canada",7,32,0
5.0,4/23/2019,"Went for lunch on a Saturday..Opted for the price fixe lunch($29, 3 course..upgraded to a 10 oz filet for an extra $10)..Received the same bread basket for myself that a party of 4 would get, was warm, butter at the perfect temp..a walnut raisin bread was part of it, yum..Wedge salad was the right temp also,  to.ato was ripe and small but thick cut cubes..nice starter..filet came out cooked perfectly (seemed a bit shy of 10 oz but I am guessing that at this price point you are getting the cuts that are as good  quality  wise but not as  visually appealing)mashed potatoes (5 stars) & creamed spinach (3 1/2- average)..Chose the cheesecake  for the closer, was very good with fresh whipped cream and strawberries..The waiter went out of his way to make me feel comfortable as a solo diner and was just as good with the couple sitting  next to me..HIGHLY RECOMMEND  for lunch !",0,0,0,Brian A.,"Huntersville, NC",11,58,93

1.0,4/21/2019,"When you go to Gallagher's, don't think high-end steakhouse. It's not. Think of a lunch counter diner that serves steak. They will make you feel like they're in a hurry, literally throwing dishes at you on your table.  And they crowd you in within elbow distance of the table next to you...and we even had reservations.  I will give them props for the New York Sirloin - perfectly grilled, medium rare, tender and flavorful. However, my wife's medium rare salmon was first served as an overdone piece of swordfish and then after we convinced them it was wrong they replaced it with an overdone piece of salmon. They agreed to comp us for the fish, but the night was lost. Not likely to risk a night on this experience again.",0,0,0,Tom D.,"Lincoln, NE",29,92,65

4.0,4/15/2019,Thanks to Nicholas and John we enjoyed the exceptional service we've read about...and our appreciation to the host for squeezing us in on a booked Saturday night.  We chose the porter house for two and it was prepared to perfection by the chef's of Gallaghers who gave us a memorable night.  The shrimp and lobster dumplings started off our meal and they alone could justify recommending you try Gallaghers for yourself.  John was attentive and frequently checked up on us so it made the experience on par with the high quality of our steak.  Looking forward to trying the tomahawk on our next visit.,0,0,1,Michael M.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",22,62,47
5.0,4/15/2019,"We were in NYC visiting family and staying at the Novotel next door and we could smell the hickory wood wafting as they fired up the coals. I don't know if it was this that awakened the primordial fire=food Neanderthal in me, or if it was the glass-fronted beef aging room that faces the street with gorgeous slabs of dry aged cuts beckoning us in, but it worked. We made a reservation (along with our 14 year old daughter who is a restaurant connoisseur) for a mid week treat. It was absolutely buzzing when we got there at 6:30, and the gracious manager (a handsome Caribbean man with a mega-watt smile) bid us wait a few minutes while our table was readied. After we chatted with him for a bit about theater (becoming more and more Disney-fied all the time) and his writing aspirations (please follow that dream) we were seated at a table very near the kitchen. Normally I would have asked for a less busy seat, as my husband and I like to talk and the frenzy was distracting but I found it amusing to watch the waiters and their carts full of luscious food come and go. We proceeded to order what turned out to be the best crab cake I have ever eaten, so full of juicy whole lumps of crab that it was barely held together by its crunchy panko crumbs on top. My daughter ordered the French onion soup which was velvety goodness, perfectly salted. She also ordered the shrimp and lobster dumplings and polished off every one. My husband and I ordered the T-bone for two, asparagus, and baked potato for a throwback meal a-la Musso and Franks in Hollywood, which we love. The beef came out perfectly charred, perfectly salted, and perfectly rosy on the inside. Now, I'll tell you this: we'd lived in Italy and had the infamous bistecca fiorentia a number of times and this steak won over the Italian cousin HANDS DOWN.  The aging process rendered it buttery and luscious, and they serve a little sauce alongside that it completely unnecessary but savory and delicious, as bit like Ballymaloe relish (I've you've ever been to Ireland and had that icon of condiments). We capped it all off with a superb bottle of SeaSmoke pinot noir (a little taste of home in CA) and ended with the profiteroles stuffed with vanilla ice cream. We were groaning full at this point, but found a way to also sample the beautiful fruit plate the kindly manager had sent our way. With his graceful style and the food's show-stopping quality, I will always recommend this restaurant to friends traveling to NYC. p.s. It's pricey, but worth it. It is a meal we will always remember.",0,0,0,Lisa D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,31,17
5.0,4/14/2019,"My husband is a big meat eater and for his birthday do you want to go to a steakhouse we've never tried before. We had plans to go see a Broadway show so I decided to make reservations at Gallaghers Steakhouse, which was nearby the show.  Upon arrival, we were seated properly. The waiter introduced himself and gave us the menu he asked for a drink water then gave us a couple of minutes to look over the menu. When our drinks came, he explained to us there were several items not listed on the menu and went through it. As soon as I heard calamari (which was not on the menu) I knew I wanted that as an appetizer! We ordered calamari and oysters as appetizers. As our entrée, we ordered steak grilled salmon french fries and spinach. I forgot to mention the bread bowl at the table. All the breads were so delicious, one tasted like a carrot cake. I had to stop myself from filling up with bread. The calamari was great my salmon was great my husband steak was amazing the french fries were great I have nothing bad to say about this place.

3.0,4/6/2019,"Went here last night spent $300 dollars on a dinner for two here and it was honestly barely worth $100. One they charge you for the sides. When you spend $50-$100 on an entree you'd think they wouldn't charge you for the sides #cheapskates. Not only that the cauliflower curry I got was cold. The baked potato my wife got looked like a basic bland spud. I honestly could have gotten my over charred steak that lacked some flavor at a Texas Roadhouse and it would have been better. They put bread crumbs on a lobster tail (this should have been a red flag to me because at first I even questioned it in my head, who does that???) but it was decent. This is the North East why would you think that's okay. My wife got the lamb chops same result over charred and there was only three of them. The highlight were the drinks because I was buzzed enough to get through the meal without being upset at the end once I saw my check. The service however was phenomenal, the waitstaff was more than friendly and helpful. If you don't mind spending a lot of money on a dinner for two go to Gramercy Tavern. Way better food.

3.0,4/6/2019,"I came here with my family for lunch and had the filet mignon, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes which was good for the price.

My husband and kids drinks also sat empty half way through the meal and were never asked if they wanted more. I did flag down a waiter that was not Robert as Robert couldn't be found and asked him to please refill our waters which he did promptly. We sat for about 15 minutes waiting to order dessert until again I flagged down another waiter that was not Robert to take the order. We ordered our deserts to go and again had to flag down a waiter for our bill to which he said ""oh no one has given you your bill""?

We also had the creamed spinach and salmon tartare, both were wonderful complements to the steak.Our waiter Nicholas was incredibly attentive, funny and made the experience great.The only reason for four stars and not five was the awkward experience while arriving. We held reservations for 9:30, and arrived on time and we're told we were checked in and would be seated when the table was ready, have a seat at the bar if we wish. Great, no problem. However after 30 minutes went by, I checked back in with the person at the front, she told me they had marked us as a no show since they went around the bar asking for us several times. This was simply not true. We were seated near the hostess stand and had made sure to pay attention when she walked out to find parties. Her colleague also doubled down on the accusation that we simply must of just not been paying attention. I have no issues with waiting, or small hiccups, things happen.

Delicious. My wife and I split a porterhouse for two,  medium. Cooked to perfection.  The steak was tender and delicious served with perfectly cooked sautéed asparagus.

Also the NY Sirloin steak I had was not the best cut. It was also a bit over cooked and butter on top was used a bit too graciously (why mask the taste?!) The service was great, and I may be nit picking because I really did love the dining experience... but there were some point to improve on (and rather big ticket items that a steakhouse should never flop on.) I will give this another try, but even with some of the mistakes, this place is a 3.8 (pushing a solid 4, maybe more if some aspects are improved upon.)

We passed by Gallagher's several times while walking around the city, pretty hard to miss with all the cuts of steak displayed in the window! We made a reservation at 9pm, but they were able to accommodate us earlier.We started our night off with drinks - our waiter was great at recommending a red wine to pair with my boyfriend's meal. We ordered the shrimp & lobster dumplings as our appetizer. To be honest, it wasn't extraordinary, but it definitely tasted like high quality shu mai dumplings! The bottoms of the dumplings were slightly overcooked, as it stuck to the plate and were difficult to peel off. Besides that, we both ordered medium-rare Ribeye Steaks with creamed spinach as our side. Our waiter truly wasn't joking when he said each side feeds about 3-4 people! When he brought out our steaks, our jaws dropped! They were humongous cuts with the perfect amount of grill marks and fat on the sides. So excited to dig in and devour our steaks! It was cooked to perfection and each bite was flavorful and juicy. Even though we weren't able to finish our entire steaks, we loved every single bite of it. Finally, we ended the meal with a slice of NY cheesecake! It was what you expected - a classic slice of cheesecake with fresh strawberries on the side. So fresh and excellent way to end dinner.Overall, our steakhouse experience was excellent! The food was amazing and definitely worth a visit if you're in NYC. The only thing that slightly bothered me was our waiter's attitude.

My steak steak came out with the right doneness however theirs came on the medium rare which I was not happy but didnt voice it to the waitstaff as they were clearly busy with the services which itself was a bit slow imo. We also ordered the jumbo crab cakes and it was great just as the cocktails( french 75, old fashioned)that we ordered were more than satisfactory. Texture of the steaks are as much as you expect them to be; a thin layer of burnt crust on top with juicy and chewy, if I had to nitpick, center of the steak. It wasnt much flavor to explore.

3.0,2/7/2019,I have always wanted to come here and finally had an opportunity. We came for restaurant week on a whim so didn't have reservations. Because of this we sat at the bar. Chairs are very comfortable so didn't really feel like a bar. Love the vibe. Felt like I was in a steakhouse from 80 years ago. Service: I am not a picky person and don't usually comment on service. The bartender was so busy and completely overwhelmed. Took us 30 min to get our drinks. Food was faster but it was wrong. We both ordered the sliced filet mignon with asparagus and the upgraded mignon with potatoes and spinach cane out. We are both eating Low carb so didn't want the potatoes or the super large steak. I pointed out the mistake and he said would you like me to slice it for you. Um no I want the other meal without the upcharge and the asparagus. Took us 30 more minutes after finishing to get the check. People around us had the same problem. There needs to be 2 bartenders on duty on Wednesdays especially during restaurant week.  Then we get the check and we are both up charged for the filet we didn't want or get. We had 15 min to get to our show at this point. We were there for 2 hours. My friend was afraid to have him take forever to make the correction so we overpaid.  1.5 out of 5Food:  wedge salad was very good. Bacon was delicious on it. 4.5 out of 5 filet mignon was good cooked perfectly. 4 out of 5 Drinks: were also very good but slow to get 4 out of 5,3,0,0,Amy B.,"Furlong, PA",22,50,2

5.0,1/28/2019,"My god is this good! Best steak I've ever had. Best crab cake as well and surprisingly some of the best salmon tartare. Gallagher's is an old school steak house. Think Goodfella's or The Godfather. There is definitely a mob vibe, or maybe that's just wishful thinking, but this is not a sleek, modern steakhouse such as SW or STK. It doesn't matter. When you're paying $50 for a steak, you expect perfection in all departments, and you get it here. From the service, to the bread, to the expansive wine list, you will not leave disappointed. Tables are close together and the ambiance is loud, but good luck finding intimate in NYC.Coming from Maine, I actually expected to spend more at a restaurant in the heart of Broadway. Two 10 ounce filet specials (one with blue cheese crust and one bone marrow...still drooling), the crab cake, salmon tartare, two glasses of Pinot Grigio and an $85 luscious Kingston Pinot Noir was $320 after tax and tip.

4.0,1/27/2019,"Classy and romantic steakhouse. Dark wood, chandeliers, low lights and mood music out of the past. The waiters are meticulously groomed, soft spoken, sporting the penguin look with white apron. Very professional and they make you feel important.The bar is huge, circular and beautiful and very much suitable for dining if you so choose. Excellent option for those flying solo.  The coat check is complimentary. We came on the coldest day in recorded history (well that's what it felt like) so it was great to shed all that outerwear before being escorted to our seats. The room temperature was perfectly comfortable. The dining room is pretty good sized so you could have a bit of a crowd in here. This is the place where the steak aging room can be seen through storefront windows from the street and as you walk in. Gets your mouth to watering.We shared a rib steak which was juicy and flavorful. It was cooked to the requested medium rare - warm red center - though I did get the impression the center was 'smaller' than I would have liked. It didn't 'fade' to the more well cooked outside; more like medium well out and an immediate change to medium rare middle. I think this may have something to do with their particular cooking method and possibly the reason some Yelpers have complained of overdone meat. Notwithstanding- it was absolutely delicious. Our sides were both specials- roasted cauliflower with curry and pine nuts which was a great flavor combo. A salad of fresh crisp green beans blended with sweet onion, peppers and firm chunks of jumbo shrimp all in a bright vinaigrette. Both of these dishes had excellent textures as well as taste and were perfect accompaniments to the steak.  We shared banana cream pie for dessert which I didn't like that much as there was too much banana and not enough cream. I did like the coffee which came in enormous cups!  Wish I'd got the Key Lime pie...next time! Hope that comes soon.",9,1,6,Gloria Z.,"Hempstead, NY",149,407,2443

I stayed due to I flew from South Florida to eat at this great place that been wanted to experience for a while & it was a let down regarding the experience.

The salmon was well done and I'm talking about how it was cooked not how I feel about it. The highlight of the meal was the vegetables, they were all delicious.

3.0,1/17/2019,"We decided to do a nice dinner right after watching a musical, and this steakhouse popped up as one of the many in the area. We called for a reservation and got a suitable time without any issues. There was complimentary coat check right at the front, which was very convenient and nice, and we were seated promptly. Many things on the menu looked delicious, though we ended up with the following: Lobster bisque: Very creamy and not so much lobster flavor, though I may be still thinking about the amazing lobster bisque from Chelsea Market.Cocktail shrimp: Decent, but the texture was just not up to par with another place in Chelsea Market. They are definitely jumbo though, which was pretty nice.Ribeye: My partner asked for Medium rare, though it was closer to the medium side. This usually happens when the steak rests just slightly too long, though the meat was still delicious. Creamed spinach: I was thrown off with the strong spinach taste as I'm more used to creamier spinach, but once I got over it, it was fairly okay.Mushrooms: This was delicious! All sorts of mushrooms all cooked very well, but I do love my mushrooms.Overall, everything was ""okay."" There were minor complaints and tweaks about most dishes, though not enough to send anything back. Service was good though and the gentleman who helped us was always around to answer any questions and offer further assistance, which was much appreciated.

Service was a little slow (but they were busy so it's fine) but all the food came out surprisingly fast. The bread was really good- lots of variety! We got calamari (their daily special) as an appetizer. My brother got the sirloin steak, I got the filet mignon, and my mom got salmon. We also got brussel sprouts and broccoli rabe to share. All the meats were huge- only my brother finished his. I personally wasn't super impressed by how the food tasted. Not a meat person, but I thought the vegetables lacked any sort of taste.

After passing by their well-presented meat display near the entrance (which will get your mouth watering), you will feel like you stepped back to the mid-1900s. Everything is well maintained and makes you feel like this is what the place probably looked like when your parents and grandparents would have come here when they were young. I cannot say enough about the staff here- the service was top notch. Our waiter was conversational (with a good sense of humor),  well knowledgeable about the food options, and clearly enjoyed his job. He definitely worked hard to make sure we had the best experience possible at Gallaghers. Unfortunately too much time has passed by between eating here and writing this review, so I cannot remember the specific dishes we had.

The host was available to seat us as soon as we arrive at our reservation time 5pm. We sat right by the kitchen. There is a glass window between the dining room and the kitchen. You can see part of the seafood and the meat station of the kitchen. The kitchen staff were well groomed. My boy friend really enjoyed his meal watching the kitchen. I sat facing the dining room. It was very cozy with the holiday decos and dining area was pretty spacious. We ordered the porterhouse for 2 medium. Sides: creamed spinach & sautéed onion. The tbone steak medium was Perfect! My bf and I both really enjoyed the steak plain. However, the sauce that they give you is amazing too! It like a sweet bbq sauce with garlic. The porterhouse for two was the perfect portion for us. The creamed spinach wasn't as creamy as I wanted it to be but still good. The sautéed onion was average. Nothing special. Just sautéed- crunchy slightly caramelized onion. The side sizes are very big. We did not finish the creamed spinach or the caramelized onion. I ordered the chocolate cake with a candle for my bday but the server told us there was a bday cake special in the house already. The complimentary chocolate cake was big enough for the two of us. They brought it out with a candle and sang the bday song for me. I will definitely be back for more steak. I will skip the creamed spinach. I will try the creme brûlée next time. Our server was great! One thing that was disappointing was that I called ahead about parking and the gentle on the phone told me there was ""free parking available directly across the st from the restaurant and also around the corner ..."" however, the parking directly across the restaurant was not free. 1.5hrs = $23.

The bone in filet mignon was slightly over cooked, not enough to send it back but if you notice the pictures I posted you'll see for yourself.

Walking in, you can see the room where all the cuts of meat are stored. It's pretty cool (even if it does look like something straight out of a Saw movie). The decor of the restaurant is beautiful. It gives off that ""old school"" NYC feeling. There are vintage photographs of celebrities everywhere dining at Gallagher's! Also, the wood panel and dim lighting definitely add to ambience. The staff is incredibly friendly. Now that we got that all out of the way, let's discuss food.OMG.I ordered the grilled 1/2 chicken (yes, I know... I went to a steakhouse and got chicken) and it was delicious! I've heard other restaurants use the phrase ""grilled to perfection"" but this chicken actually was! And, it had such a great pepper flavor to it. The chicken is served with a side a of couscous. Now, in no way shape or form as I a couscous fan, but Gallagher's couscous actually wasn't too bad. I also had mashed potatoes and onion rings on the side and both were just as amazing as the chicken.

Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides were delicious! We were seated near the bar and the bartender named CHRIS dressed in a white long jacket, was loud, rude and condescending to all other employees. We heard him OVER and OVER FBombing and such!

4.0,12/1/2018,"This truly should be a five start restaurant and I hate to take any thing away from them because their food was amazing but the service was terrible.  We had a reservation for 3:45 but we were not seated until 4:15 because they marked us as already being seated and didn't realize until after I questioned them. The server took another 10 minutes to take our drink order then another 15 minutes to take our food order. We ordered salad,  Ribeye, prime Rib, creamed spinach and onion rings. The Ribeye was great, the Prime Rib was amazing and both sides had really good flavor. Then we waited again... finally another waiter noticed us and came to remove our dishes and refill our drinks. He came back to give us a dessert menu then came to take our order after another 15 minutes went by without our waiter coming around. Creme brûlée was good. Then we waited some more until we literally waved down our waiter for the check. Good thing we didn't need change because who knows how long that would have taken. There were so many people waiting to be seated and all I could think was that our THREE hour meal could have been a 1 1/2 to 2 hour meal and people would have actually been seated during their own reservation times. If the restaurant was crowed when we first got there then maybe I would have understood the insanely slow service but that was not the case, there were four tables open in our area alone for the first 30 minutes we were seated.

4.0,11/15/2018,"Ate at Gallaghers recently and the food was really good! I would say it was for sure not the best steak house I have ever been to, but for what we got it was very good.  We made a reservation the day of and got the time we wanted. We arrived about 20 minutes early and our table was ready for us. We were seated very close to other people at the restaurant but it was not bad. We thought by the pictures online this place would be a little more classy, but it wan not. People were wearing tee shirts and other not dressy clothing here. Do not worry about the dress code, no one follows it.  We started out with Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and they tasted amazing! They were big and plump. They came with cocktail sauce and we added some tarter sauce.  Our next course was soup! I got the Lobster Bisque and my friend got the French Onion Soup. The lobster bisque was very underwhelming. The soup could have used more salt and flavor in it. It was just okay.  For the main dinner we each got steak. My friend received the ribeye and I got the Filet. The filet was slightly overcooked and was not packed with flavor. The ribeye my friend got she said was good, but again not the best she has ever had.  The sides here are huge! We got the mushrooms and a loaded baked potato for the sides and they were huge and good. We both did not finish our meals and I think the waiters were annoyed we did not want to take them with us, but it was too much food and we wanted to go a few other places while in town.  Overall an expensive but good place to go out at. It was right in Time Square which was nice!

3.0,11/14/2018,"Had a delicious meal at Gallaghers. For appetizers we ordered the shrimp & lobster dumplings and the burrata with coal-fired peppers. Both were delicious, especially the burrata. For my meal I had the filet mignon with the blue cheese crust. It was very tasty and perfectly cooked, I ordered it rare. I have dined at many of the popular steakhouses in Manhattan. Although we had a really nice meal and I do not have any complaints about the food, I wouldn't say that Gallagher's stood out in my mind compared to any of the other steakhouses I've been to. You will usually get a great steak at any of the high end steakhouses in Manhattan, but the overall experience is usually what determines if I will return. Unfortunately, I most likely will not be returning to Gallagher's. We sat upstairs in a separate room that almost seemed like it was where they placed all of the misfits that were not suitable for the main dining room, which we had a laugh at. It ended up being nicer as the room is much quieter than the main dining room. We had an adorable elderly man as our waiter who was very attentive and full of recommendations. What turned me off the most about Gallagher's was our experience before being seated. We arrived 5 minutes early for our 7PM reservation on a Saturday night. We were told it would be a short wait while our table was being prepared. After waiting for 10-15 minutes we inquired on the status of our table, because several other parties had walked in after us and been seated. We were told the table was not ready so we decided to get a drink at the bar. I will spare the details in hopes of not turning this into an essay, but the overall vibe we received from both the host and the bartender was, for lack of a better word, pretentious. It put a bad taste in my mouth and although we had a great meal, I would rather dine somewhere, such as Club-A steakhouse, where from the second I walked in the door we had a really great experience. If it weren't for the host & bartender and 30 minute wait time, when we had a reservation, I would have given this 4 stars.",0,0,0,Tayler F.,"New York, NY",2,14,38

1.0,11/13/2018,"What a letdown. Cool looking old space with an awesome meat window but the dining experience was mediocre across the board. Cocktails were the highlight. Their signature old fashioned was excellent. Their bacon appetizer was also very nice - a bit different than Luger/ Wolfgang. Everything else was a train wreck and we left a full steak for 6 uneaten on the table.  First complaint - someone ordered a dirty martini and it came red. Three times. Sweet vermouth in a gin martini is amateur. Not understanding and messing it up 2 more times is just sad. Second complaint - nothing came cooked at the requested temperature. Ordered lamb chops rare, got medium well. Ordered steak medium rare, got blue.  They were gracious enough to bring us new steaks (can't refire a steak once sliced).  Even the new steak disappointed. Left it. Third complaint - the food just wasn't very good.  The lobster in the seafood tower had a coating of white slime on it. The steaks were all dry and had a funny aftertaste - maybe it was the wood. Skipped dessert and won't go back. Wolfgang's near the port authority is a much better choice in that neighborhood.

3.0,11/6/2018,"Had dinner with a buddy here and really enjoyed the food and the service.  This is a steakhouse so it's pretty loud and there is plenty of testosterone floating around but it's not as bad as some of the other steakhouses in midtown.Service is great from start to finish.  Because we were having steak, we didn't order any appetizers.  I had the sliced sirloin which was awesome, but it was so much I had to take a doggy bag.  We also had onion rings which are exceptionally delicious and the twice baked potatoes, which were also great.  For dessert, we had key lime pie and pecan pie.  Key lime was just okay but pecan was very good.I had to ding some stars off for the drinks, however.  I started with the house old fashioned, which sounded promising with a blend of bourbon and rye but when I got it, all I could taste was lemon.  Also, none of the bourbon or rye really came through and there was no sweetness at all.   It tasted a bit like those canned iced teas with lemon flavor. Thinking that may have been a fluke, I ordered a bourbon old fashioned with Buffalo Trace.  Again, the lemon was overwhelming and I really couldn't taste the flavor of the bourbon.  It had that canned iced tea taste.  Thinking it might be the lemon, I ordered another one and requested no lemon.  That was marginally better, but still no bourbon flavor coming through.  I don't know what their deal was but I would not order anything bourbon-related there again.  My friend's Tito's with a twist was fine.Overall, a decent place and prices aren't too crazy considering this is midtown.  Go for the steak, but not the bourbon.",13,3,8,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300

Our evening began well - we ordered a dozen oysters, burrata with peppers and wine from their tremendous selection to start. Oysters were excellent, burrata was delicious and the wine was outstanding - a dream start for any meal. We ordered the porterhouse next and that's when the wheels came off; when it arrived it wasn't the 'medium rare' that we expected - it was just 'rare', it had large chunks of un-rendered, un-eatable fat - extremely off putting, given that the one thing that you are proudly showing off on the window of your restaurant is the dry aged meat itself.

The rest of the dinner the managers kept visiting our table and asking how we were enjoying our meal which only added insult to injury.

The crab cake is only one but it was a good piece to share for two. Such fresh crab and delicious flavors! Entrees and sides: two 14 oz filet mignons. One with the bone marrow crust and the other with the pepper crust. I got the bone marrow crust and if you love bone marrow look no further. It was absolutely mouth watering! I thought I was going to pass out from the flavors. It was also my first steak in over a year so maybe that had to do with it but the steaks were just SO PERFECT. I had mine cooked to medium and it was stunning. Our sides were creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. WARNING- the sides are HUGE. literally enough for 4 so be careful! We couldn't finish our sides. They were both so delicious I almost forced myself to eat it all! Glad I wore my stretch jeans that night. The ambience was lovely, music wasn't too loud, such a classy joint.

I informed them that she was not joining us for dinner and will only be sitting. The host said we must still wait and when she arrives we will be seated. Once she got there 5mins later, we let the host know that the 3rd person arrived. He just completely ignored any eye contact and continued to help other people. I asked once more and he said ""Sorry You need to wait another 20mins."" And turned his face and contributed to ignore us. Service is a crucial part to any restaurant.

My boyfriend and I ordered prime rib and a side of asparagus. The prime rib was just okay, it could of used a little bit more flavor. I was kind of bummed out because I heard such good things and saw pictures that drew me into this place. The asparagus were honestly so bland and hard nothing special at all. Our drinks and food came out in about 20 minutes which was weirdly fast but it was nice. The waiters are super nice and out going but the only thing that bothered me was they would check in on us about every 10 minutes which was just too much. When we finished they immediately took our plates and then came back with a complimentary cake with a candle and sung to us which was very nice.

Well seasoned but nothing phenomenal.The French Onion Soup was just ordinary, probably much better elsewhere in walking distance.The 10 oz. Filet Mignon came out well overcooked, quite past the doneness of medium when ordered medium rare. We had it taken back to have it come back out completely rare. With an obvious change of attitude of the waiters when the manager showed up on our side of the restaurant, the waiters came back so apologetic. The manager decided he would take off $10 from our tab as courtesy. Under appreciation, I am rating this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1. I could see that the manager was trying to brighten up our experience but unfortunately, the damage was already done.Not to mention a steakhouse that does not know how to control the doneness of their meat, they need far better training or supervision of their waiters.

1.0,8/9/2018,"Poor service and food quality. The whole experience would have been better had the waiter not been so defensive and arrogant at the end. We ordered 2 New York Sirloin steak, one filet mignon, one Rib Eye steak with bone and a grilled salmon. We were very disappointed as the New York steak and the filet mignon were very tough and chewy! We honestly told a staff who worked there how we felt about the steak and he was very nice about it and asked if we would like to change it. However, we felt that we wouldn't be able to finish the steak and did not want to waste the food. Hence, we respectfully declined his offer. After the meal, we were given a complimentary fruit platter. However, we found mouldy blueberries in it and since it was complimentary, we weren't too concerned about the spoiled fruit. But when the waiter came to clean the table, I told him about the mouldy blueberries as a gesture of kindness for other guests who might receive the fruits. I think this is meant to be a joke but I'm not sure, he replied ""this is what you get for trying to do something nice!"" At that time, I took it as a joke and didn't think much of it. I then went to the restroom afterwards and I met the waiter on the way back from the ladies' room to my table. He stopped me and explained that he sent a fruit platter to our table because we weren't satisfied with the quality of the steaks. It seemed to me that he was very defensive about serving mouldy blueberries to us, and tried to justify it by saying that the restaurant was simply trying to do sth nice for us. In that case, I would rather not have them served me mouldy blueberries in the first place. It would have been nice and would have left the night at a good note had he not been so arrogant and felt the need to justify putting mouldy fruits on our table. I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and very unhappy with how he handled the situation. Poor customer service and attitude overall, and ruined his initial good impression on us. The food we ordered did not meet the standards of the price we were paying, even though we saw Gallagher's had received decent reviews. In our experience at Gallagher's we received poor quality food and terrible service! We did not receive an apology during this event. Too bad I forgot our waiter's name!

1.0,8/3/2018,"Very disappointing experience at Gallaghers for my dinner in New York with my father, I've been to many different steakhouses but this one was offensive and un-accommodating.I get there a tad early and the maitre de said that my pop wasn't there yet, so I went to the bar for a drink.  The bartender was brisk and not very personable, when I asked for my favorite whiskey they did not have it, and when my dad said Coors Light he gave him a shade stare, like dude who are you to judge, the guy doesn't like coors light, just get him what he likes. The drinks were not that good either.Then afterwards, we move to the dining room because he's hungry and we meet the server, an older gentleman, and look over the menu.  The maitre de comes over and says it's policy that I can't wear my hat in the dining room.  Um, excuse me, in my religion we must keep our heads covered at all times.  I wasn't wearing a keepah or anything but, it's a lil ridiculous that this is a rule. Its archaic and old school. Wakeup, its 2018. If people are paying for it, they should do/wear what they want.Next thing, we get to ordering our steaks. My dad wanted his steak cooked one way, and the waiter literally said to him ""The chef will get mad, he doesn't want to cook it that way, we'll see what he can do"". Listen man, again, this is a restaurant, you don't tell the customers how to eat/cook their meals. If they want it that way, they get it that way, and you don't judge. It was ridiculous.Food comes, I got a Filet Mignon and some Spinach. The steak was whatever, nothing to write home about or really that good. For my dad they gave it to him RARE.  He was pissed, and told the manager about the whole experience. He was doing his best to accommodate, but overall this place is just rude, boogie, and not worth your time.There are dozens of other steakhouses in the city that are worth a trip. This spot.

A simple cappuccino order with dessert was ignored for 15 minutes until I reminded the last person who came to our table.  Needless to say, they never made it so I just cancelled it.  Overall, a great atmosphere and great food.  However, the inconsistency in service one night over another does not convince me to visit again.   At 150.00/per person dinner, my expectations are a little more, especially after seeing what they could do when properly focused/encouraged?There are too many great steakhouses in NYC to take another chance at this location.  Disappointing - as I wanted to love this place.",0,0,0,Frank M.,"Shelton, CT",0,4,0

It came out to be fairly rare, so I had to ask to have it cooked a bit more. It came back somewhere between medium rare and medium. The steak itself, which should have had the most marbling of all the steaks, didn't actually have a lot of marbling (maybe it was just my cut). It therefore made the meat a bit tough and the chewing was a good jaw workout. The steak had a bit of a grainy texture to it as well. Not bad, not great. Just okay.The sides were excellent - mushrooms, lyonnaise, broccoli rabe, asparagus. Yum.

5.0,7/6/2018,"On my last night in NYC, our daughter booked a steak place and she couldn't have picked a better one. The historic (over 70 years) restaurant has had a million dollar make over. Several of the waiters have served there 30+ years. Although our waiter, Adam, has only worked at the restaurant for three years, he handled us like an old pro. I kept it simple with a filet mignon, medium served with mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly with a good crust on top. The mashed potatoes were creamy. For dessert I ordered the cream brûlée'. The top cracked perfectly and the rest was just heaven.

The breads, Cesar salad were great and the French onion soup was to die for. Our main gripe was the sides. Cream of spinach had no cream, Brussels were ok and the mushrooms were very earthy chanterelles (which I liked but others in my party would have preferred button). Apple strudel a la mode was excellent. All in all a good steak house experience that would have been great if we had liked the flavor of the sides better.",0,0,0,Clive H.,"Santa Clara, CA",31,30,0

5.0,7/1/2018,"A true 5-star steakhouse. From the seating by the host to our servers (Ceasar and Juan) to the managers who check-ed in to see that our experience was wonderful (Lawrence) we have to say this was a truly great dinner. We started the breads and butter, which had a touch of sea salt to make the taste even better. Then we continued with clams oreganata, and then a sirloin and a rib-eye steak, with sides of corn off the cob and mac and cheese. The steaks were great, and the steak sauce (a Gallagher secret) was a great compliment to the meal. The dessert was a birthday raspberry chocolate cake, and a large cup of pressed tea -- and a espresso martini, which my hubby says is the best drink he has ever had (photo to follow so you can see what this lovely drink looked like). The meal was great but truly the service was outstanding. The recommendations by the waiters was spot on. The kindness of the waitstaff made our meal comfortable and enjoyable. We appreciate a place where you are not rushed, but that will get you finished in time for a show if you are seeing one. We also appreciate a waitstaff that takes the time to talk to the patrons and make recommendations that make sense. We have visited a lot of restaurants in Manhattan, and there are a lot of choices in the Theatre district. Gallaghers Steakhouse is now in our top 5 places to return to. We see why for over 90 years this has been a NYC staple.",4,0,1,Stacy K.,"Oceanside, NY",300,203,217
4.0,6/30/2018,"Spent weeks researching the perfect place to have a steak in NYC...Pros: Great location, close to theaters in Times Square. Atmosphere was great, loved the music and it felt very cozy. The host was very helpful in helping me adjust my reservation. Cons: Steaks were just okay.. we were just very underwhelmed with the flavor in both of our cuts. I had the filet and boyfriend had the rib steak. Both cuts were cooked to our desired temperature, but the flavor just wasn't a hit. Our waiter was not the friendliest and that was the most disappointing honestly. Overheard him talking about another patron after he had left the restaurant... Would be willing to try again, but will order different cuts of steak..",0,0,0,Lauren W.,"Bossier City, LA",113,6,2

The bread they served was an excellent variety! The meal... my 13 year old and I both had filet. We both asked for medium and it came out perfect. My dad had lamb chops which he said were delicious and my mom got fried shrimp! The size of the shrimp was awesome! Like double jumbo! The flavor was so good, I was surprised!

5.0,6/22/2018,"We really enjoyed our meal at Gallagher's. The building, service and food were all great. Since I had beef for lunch, I chose  the broiled swordfish with creamed spinach and baked potato for dinner. The others in my group had steaks. The fish was prepared perfectly and it was a huge piece. The side dishes were easily large enough for four people and they too were very tasty. I topped it off with a piece of key lime pie that was as big as Manhattan itself. We cut it into three pieces so everyone could have some. The restaurant was quite interesting. It was built in the early 1920s and Gallagher's has been operating continuously since then. There is dark wood everywhere and that was typical for Manhattan steak restaurants of that era. There are pictures of race horses back from the 1920s on all the walls. The restrooms are 1920s in design with modern plumbing.The wait staff is primarily men in black uniforms. The head waiter told me that open flames in restaurants is strictly prohibited by the NYC fire code, but they still found a way to cook the fish and steaks with the dark grilling lines.

5.0,6/20/2018,"We went to see ""Mean Girls"" at the August Wilson Theatre and wanted dinner after. We saw a Cuban restaurant across the street and walked over. Once across the street we got into a match of 'what do you want to eat'. If you are in a relationship, you know how annoying that is. As we walked by the window with all the meat in the freezer the fight was over. If you are a meat lover, how can you resist. We walked in, but didn't have a reservation. We waited about 5 minutes and we were seated. We were immediately approached by Rick, the server. Let me tell you he was classic New Yorker; gruff voice, well mannered with an edge, even called Chris my boyfriend 'Boss'. I giggled. I did notice that he would address Chris more. I guess he looks like the boss at the table. (giggle)I started with a Caesar; romaine, garlic croutons, grana padano $13. The dressing was fresh, delicious. Salty from the anchovy, which I love. I ordered the Surf & Turf. Wonderful lobster tail with a thick piece of Filet Mignon (10oz). Medium rare. The most tender piece of meat I've ever tasted. And I've had a lot of meat in my life. (hold the jokes).As sides we got the Brussels Sprouts $12 and Cauliflower with curry, pine nuts and raisins. (special of the night) $12. For dessert we had Pecan Pie and NY Cheesecake, each for $12. I don't do dairy so I only took a small nibble of cheesecake, but it was so smooth. No ice cream on the Pecan Pie, but it looked delicious. Try it and let me know. Overall we had an amazing experience, we even chatted with the couple at the table next to us.

I had to stop him three times from walking away from the table so that I could order appetizers and drinks. After we got our food which was undercooked. we never saw Rick again.

Also, I got the dirty plate and fork then I asked for the change. My server took so long. After 20 minutes waiting, I asked help from the food runner instead!!! The way to cook steak is pretty cool and professional but due to high volume of customers, you should expect the delay in every single things you requested except when you asked for the check.

4.0,5/27/2018,"I had a nice dinner with my boyfriend at Gallaghers after catching a late Broadway show. During the intermission, we took a chance and called Gallaghers to see if they could take a last minute reservation around 9:45pm. Luckily, someone had cancelled their 10pm reservation just before we called, so we took it. We showed up about 15 min. before 10, but the maitre d' was able to get us a table in the next 5 min.The restaurant is beautiful, well lit, and had a nice ambiance. With the Sinatra and big band playing in the background, it reminded me of an Italian restaurant from back home. Overall customer service was great - From the awesome maitre d' who was super accommodating to our head waiter who was friendly, personable, and very attentive. Loved the food. We started with a split wedge that came with a thick cut of tomato, chunks of blue cheese, and bacon pieces. Typically a wedge salad comes with blue cheese dressing, but something about the fat chunks of real blue cheese that Gallaghers uses took this salad to the next level. My boyfriend ordered a rib eye, and I got a prime rib. My prime rib was cooked to medium rare perfection, and I certainly preferred it over my boyfriend's steak. We also ordered a couple of rich sides. The Mac and cheese wasn't bad, but the creamed spinach was the best I've had at a steakhouse so far. The horseradish cream paired nicely with my prime rib, but it wasn't as spicy as I normally like it. The Gallaghers house sauce is BOMB!

Gallaghers impressed with it's recent remodel......Dark woods, deep cordovan colored banquettes, more than adequate space between tables, expansive bar and that amazing aging room upon entering.Appetizers were a wonderfully rich and boozy French onion soup, smooth, creamy and sensual Lobster bisque and of course the thick cut bacon with a sweet, salty sugar glaze.The 28 day aged Porterhouse arrived.....all 4 of them, perfectly medium rare with nice charred ends, sides of mashed potatoes,mushrooms,creamed spinach,grilled asparagus and horse radish all quite good but on to the star of the show......The steak.The Porterhouse was soft but not too soft with a great mouth feel and just that little bit of funky blue cheese background that comes with a dry aged steak, with just a tiny dab of creamed horseradish the meat really impressed. The charred ends, fatty and delicious with just the right amount of seasoning was to fight over and I can't wait to attack those bones in the privacy of my own home....isn't going to be pretty but most assuredly tasty.Dessert was a crumbly blueberry cake with a tart berry sauce and vanilla ice cream, a wonderfully sweet Banana cream pie and a chocolate cake after our very attentive and professional server, Nicky, overheard us say it was a birthday lunch for my wife's niece. Thank You Nicky!This was one of the best meals I've had in a steakhouse in awhile and I've had quite a few over the years.

2.0,4/28/2018,Had an early diner at Gallagher's since we were already in area and my husband used to go here about 10 years ago. They specializes in dry aged steaks and you can see them in display the moment you step in. The ambiance is nice but a little bit touristy. So we started with beet salad and crab cakes. The crab cakes were very good but the beet salad is a little bit lacking. They were cut up so small that you'd have to use a spoon to be able to eat them which it shouldn't be. Then to the main course we both had 10 oz. filet mignon with sautéed spinach and a special twice baked potato. The filets were dryad tough even with their steak sauce. It tasted like it was deep fried and the twice baked potato wasn't good either. They were very salty and almost burnt. So yeah overall it was a let down. Not what my husband used to remember it to be. There are so many better steak houses in NYC with the same or lower price point. I think it was actually overpriced for the quality that they delivered. The service was ok. I wouldn't go back nor recommend it.,0,1,0,Simone G.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,30,7

My other boys steak was blue/raw and tremendously fatty to the point it was inedible...  I couldn't cut it with the heavy duty steak knife.  Thin grainy raw membrane so tough & under cooked it couldn't be cut.  as a dad I switched with the Birthday boy and reluctantly & embarrassed mentioned and showed the atrocious waste to my waiter the manager offered a new steak late into the dinner.  They offered to take it off the bill.   I declined they removed the steak anyway.  The Desserts were amazing they even sent a complimentary fruit platter.   My complaint is why serve the kids a inferior thinner less quality steak but charge the same price?  We felt like it was a con on the kids... they asked ""is this a Kids menu"" ? That was the Tremendously disappointing event .  On what could have been / should have been an epic celebration it still was but it was deflated due to the choice of meats served to my 2 athletic carnivores.  Be ware I think they bait & switch kids shave 6 ounces here 6 ounces there.   Bad cuts to kids thinking what do they know.   PS I left hungry on steak full on DESSERT.  1st for me.

The bartender had the chef come out cut open my steak and it was clearly over cooked 50% of the meat. Then he basically pushed the plate back at me and said ""what do you want""? Why attack a client?

Sat promptly with a high chair. We were there on Tuesday (3/6/18) around 4pm and the waiter seemed disgusted with us, most likely because we had our child in a more uppity steakhouse. He was very short with us and had an attitude as if he was trying to get the meal over with as quick as possible to get us out.

We had a reservation somewhere else for over a month, and got very lucky that we were able to get a reservation at Gallaghers about two hours before dinner service on a weekend. Everything about our experience was phenomenal. I was actually surprised to read some of the negative reviews about the service here, because that was the highlight of our evening. Our server was incredibly warm and attentive, and it seemed like there were 2 or 3 other servers waiting in the wings at all times to refill water, scrape crumbs, and flawlessly change out courses like clockwork. We have been to other high-end steakhouses in our home city, where we were left feeling very unwelcome and insignificant, but Gallaghers left us with the complete opposite feeling. My husband said it was the best service and best prime rib he has ever had in his life. My steak was equally delicious - perfectly cooked to medium rare, and great color on the outside. The sides, sautéed spinach (somehow the best, garlicky, fresh, spinach ever) and mashed potatoes perfectly rounded out the meal.

First impression was meeting the Host, a gentleman,and I use that term loosely, who frowned upon our 20 minute early arrival, by telling us we could sit at the bar and wait there, problem was, the bar was already full, and there was no waiting area on this cold,rainy night, so we had to stand next to him for 20 minutes,no fun for either of us.I ordered the 14 oz Filet Mignon, cooked medium. After I cut off the first piece the rest was raw red !  I asked the waiter to have them make it well done (considering what they think ""Medium"" was.  I finished my two side dishes,and the bread before the steak reappeared. This along with only a choice of 3 Cabernets (by the glass) and "" Cain"" at $22 a glass, was nothing to write home about , it was a disappointing night on many levels.

Despite the extravagant room where all the steaks are out for display in front of you as soon as you walk in, the rest of the experience was basically a pricier Morton's. The mac and cheese was probably my favorite dish of the evening. The wine selection was severely lacking, and even worse was the abysmal service. We had a reservation and got seated an annoying 20 minutes late. But the real offense of the night was yet to come. How dare you walk us to a table that's basically an intimate booth meant to seat 4 people and suggest that we sit there WHEN THERE'S ALREADY A COUPLE SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER THERE. What, should we just have had an impromptu double date with what appeared to be a new couple who clearly didn't know each other very well and most probably had just connected on tinder? The gaped mouth faces they made when our server walked us over to their table to suggest that we join them for their diarrhea fest of newfound love and empty promises was priceless. My girlfriend nearly had a seizure worth calling an ambulance for when she realized where the fuck our server was about to seat us. Luckily they had a bar style circular table with barstools available for us to sit at when they failed to make us make new friends with strangers at a steak house.Tldr, I'd tell them to fire all of the employees aged 65 and older but then they'd have no one left.

We had a tough time deciding on appetizers--chose shrimp/lobster wontons and crab cake-both delicious. Wedge salad was impressive. We split a petite filet and twice-baked potato. Filet was wonderful--potato the only underwhelming choice we made.

4.0,2/10/2018,"I came here with a group of friends to celebrate my belated birthday dinner. My friend who is a regular at the restaurant made the reservations so​ that process was seamless. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by the host. We were seated at a round table towards the middle of the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant was posh, sprawling and supremely​ comfortable and inviting. So much so that we ended up staying until midnight! There were plush red seats and photographs of celebrities who have visited Gallaghers all over the brown walls. We were served complimentary bread and salted butter. There were 2 different kinds of bread: A soft, slightly sweet loaf and the other was of the savory variety with sesame seed crust. There were several specials tonight, including the Surf and Turf (lobster and filet mignon), fried calamari, green bean salad and cauliflower appetizer. I was trying to decide between lamb chops or the filet mignon. Ultimately, up ordering the Surf and Turf, as well as calamari and french fries to share. My friends also ordered the following sides: Mac and Cheese, Broccoli Rabe, Mushroom, Broccoli, and Creamed Spinach. The calamari came first and I was not impressed. It wasn't crispy enough for me and was a bit bland. In retrospect, I think the green bean salad with bacon would have been better. Then the rest of the sides came out and my Surf & Turf came with a large bowl of warm melted butter. The lobster was delicious... Nice and tender with great flavor and wonderful seasoning. The filet mignon I asked for medium well but it definitely was well done, with the outer part being slightly charred. It was tasty ​but was a bit dry and tough. Also, I would have liked some sauce to go with it. Out of the sides, I really enjoyed the french fries and mac & cheese. The fries were perfectly crispy and full of amazing potato flavor. The mac and cheese had bread crumbs on top. It was extremely creamy, cheesy, gooey and the cheese was well blended with the macaroni. The mushroom and broccoli rabe were also good and quite fresh. The broccoli came in huge chunks and could have been a bit softer. When it was time for dessert, the restaurant servers came out with an adorable mini individual chocolate cake with a pink (my favorite color!) candle in it and sang Happy Birthday for me. The cake was absolutely delectable! It was covered with light brown chocolate frosting with darker chocolate dots around the rim. There were multiple layers and I detected a taste of raspberry, which was a nice touch. The chocolate frosting was rich, luscious and sweet, while the cake itself was velvety and moist. Our waiter, Rick was awesome. He catered to all of our needs with grace and ease. When it came time for the bill, each of us got separate checks. My friends all had a lovely experience and I certainly want to come back but it's a little on the expensive side so I won't be making regular appearances.",21,9,13,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876
5.0,2/9/2018,We visited Gallagher's over a week ago and cannot get the meal out of heads!  We opted for prime rib and lamb chops with broccoli rabe (sides are to share).  Both meats were prepared to perfection and so unbelievably tender and mouthwateringly juicy.  Our server was totally down to earth and proud of the restaurant's history.  Sad to say but you do not experience this level of old school service any more.  We can't wait to return!,0,0,0,Jennifer S.,"Port Chester, NY",0,23,3

2.0,1/28/2018,"I was looking forward to attending Gallagher's all week. We try to cross off a couple restaurants every time RW comes around, and this time it was Gallagher's turn.The interior is quite nice and the meat locker is pure picture bait. The staff made us wait an additional 20 minutes to be seated, which was no big deal as we were a party of 5. The tables are a little close together and overall it felt somewhat stuffy once seated. After being seated, it took nearly another 10 minutes until we were even acknowledged. The gentleman dropped the menus off and did not return for some time. I am not sure if this was because we were there for RW and he assumed we would not be a large tip table.Unfortunately, this would be the theme throughout the rest of the evening. Never in my life have I felt so insignificant and utterly blown off by a waiter let alone at what I assumed to be a top steakhouse in NYC. We were never checked in on again for another 45 minutes. The entrees came, and one was forgotten making us all wait longer in order to begin eating. I cannot stress Just how disappointed we were for the duration of the meal for how our table was treated.Finally we got to the good stuff. At this point, it could have been the best steak I ever had in my life and I would have still had a sour taste in my mouth. But not even the meat met my expectations. The filet was somewhat tough, and just not nearly up to par. Not that we could have complained about anything being our waiter had no interest in taking care of our table. The sides (hash brown, onion rings) were great, but unfortunately that just doesn't cut it. The waiter had to be reminded to bring us the food we asked to be packed, we were honestly just going to leave it at that point. Such poor, disappointing service ruined this spot.

Well, Med. Rare and Well Done.  Each was cooked to perfection!  Flavors, tenderness, juiciness.... it was all there!  The creamed spinach, sautéed spinach, mashed potatoes all were served in quantities large enough to feed more than two people.  They each were amazing in their own right.My girlfriend is already making plans to return.  Can't say I blame her!  Gallaghers, you'll have four more new repeat customers soon!",0,0,3,Lawrence D.,"New York, NY",46,127,47

2.0,12/13/2017,"I don't write reviews, but yesterday's conversation with Javier at this restaurant has really pushed me to write this review. My mother and mother-in-law were visiting New York and asked me to find a steakhouse close-by. After reading the reviews and looking at the online menu, I recommended to go to this restaurant. The online menu showed the price to be $51 2/3/4 for porterhouse. Although it was surprising to me, that it was so low for this cut, it did not say anything about per person. My mother and her companion do not speak enough English to comprehend everything said to them, but when they saw the recommended porterhouse they ordered it. When my mother called and said that they were charged $102, she called me and put me on the phone with Javier who apologized to me about confusion, however began to say, that although he did not hear the conversation between the customers and the server, he was insisting that the server told them that it was the price per person. Saying that it was a mistake and it will be fixed. There was no consistency in their menu information. I am attaching the screenshot of the menu online, which does not mention anything about per person price. Without further conversation, this person I spoke with, hung up the call, and did not show any good customer service, did not want to accept the fact that they made a mistake. Where is the time when the business did things to reach good customer satisfaction? Or to just simply accept the fact they made a mistake, misinformed the customer, and the customer paid twice more than it was expected? I am disappointed at the way it was handled. I give two stars, because I know the steaks are good, but it's not only about the food, it's about the experience. I will not be coming to this place.

4.0,11/15/2017,Made my own surf and turf by ordering the rib steak and grilled shrimp. Rib steak was above average but a touch oily and heavy. Thankfully their house sauce has a delicious flavour and tang that cut the heavy feeling. I despise using sauces and this is an extremely rare exception. The shrimp was over cooked. Overall it's ok with classic steakhouse ambiance and a price to match that plus the fact that it is in the theatre district. Overall I would come back if I had to have steak in the area but otherwise there are better choices. Not Peter Luger. That place is overrated,0,0,0,''Rob C.,"Toronto, Canada",82,61,34

He took a look around and said he had just given another couple a check and they were wrapping up.  As soon as they were getting up he called us over  and bussed the section and we got a seat--super clutch!We asked Don what's a good app--he recommended the lobster and shrimp dumplings, which are unique so we decided to give them a try.  They were amazing! My wife got the filet mignon and I got the bone-in Ribeye (this is what we always get at all steakhouses).  The quality of the steaks were superb--Gallagher's might have inched out Strip House and Keen's for our favorite steaks. As for drinks, I asked Don what are some good speciality drinks--I said I like whiskey and my wife likes champagne.  He recommended the 52nd Street Old Fashioned and a French 75 for my wife.  The drinks were excellent.We will definitely be coming back and doing the same thing all over again--wouldn't change a thing.",0,0,0,Joey L.,"Ramsey, NJ",0,13,0

It's a beautiful building, with class and sophistication, and deserves to be treated as such. With that said, the food, again, is always perfect. The price is average for a great steakhouse, with a decent meal with no skimping for the people who really like to eat good food going for an average of 80-100 dollars a head(that's on a gluttony scale, I can never control myself here).I don't go often, but when I do, it's always an amazing experience.

Service: Pretty attentive, knowledge and quick. Food: everything we had was pretty spot on but I have to point out a few items that we always order since our first visit - porterhouse - perfectly seasoned and cooked (I like mine medium rare) - prime rib (my friends fav- personally I like the porterhouse) - burrata - calamari (specials not on regular menu) - beef carpaccio - lyonnaise side is pretty damn good as is the hashbrown - blueberry cake (it's a special sometimes they have it sometimes they don't) Pro tips: if you want prime rib call to reserve as they do run out If you need a high chair call ahead to reserve as there is only one on the restaurant If you're celebrating a birthday like we did the birthday person gets their own personal chocolate mini cake it's quite delicious All in all by far a must visit steakhouse in NYC.",7,1,4,Pattie L.,"Queens, NY",36,325,4162

I know it's steakhouse, but the shrimp was ridiculously tasty. The rib steak had a great char and the natural aging process definitely enhanced the flavor. Oh, I can't forget the side dish we had.

The filet mignon with mushroom garlic butter was the best steak I've ever put in my mouth. Just heavenly and so tender.

I would have enjoyed this gazpacho soup a lot more if they didn't skimp on the crab meat. It was still good with the fresh ingredients and perfect for summer. My main course was the filet mignon, medium with the perfect amount of pink meat. I enjoyed the side veggies, but also would enjoy a potato side dish, like a side of frites.

Went with the veal rib chop which was really good. Split a few appetizers with the group (Burrata, Shrimp and Lobster Dumplings, Veal Carpaccio and Crab Cake), once again all good.

We mention to Frank it was our 10 year anniversary and by the end of our meal they came and wished us a happy anniversary in song. In conclusion this was by far the most we have ever spent on a dinner. But the food and personal service we received also made it one of the best dining experiences.

It adds an awesome flavor that you won't get anywhere else. Lots of sides to choose from but the fries are fantastic, and I'm not even a big French-fry person. It's loud, crowded, and the waiters have to run to keep up but it's worth it. Go with someone and get the porterhouse for two.

Our waiter Adam was attentive and informative just plain helpful.  We all agreed that this may have been the best steak dinner we had in a very long time.  Btw, the filet of sole was fresh caught, deliciously prepared and filleted table side.  Sorry no report on desserts as we were totally stuffed by the time we got to it.  Five stars are well deserved!",1,0,0,Alan G.,"Livingston, NJ",29,4,0

The mac and cheese was creamy, and the lyonesse had a smoothness about it that was delectable.

First, this place has a stunningly short supply of prime rib for a popular steakhouse located in midtown Manhattan. We were told there were only a dozen a night!

Overall, it was worth the $10 surcharge. - Lamb chops - not recommended when the beef is so much better, plus it had a $5 surcharge. Asked for medium well but meat came out as well done.- Mashed potatoes - solid- Creamed spinach - solid as well and not overly creamy- NY cheesecake - the best we've ever had. Smooth texture, not too sweet and very indulgent. Quality ingredients and without the cheap sugar that causes headaches.  Graham cracker crust and thick whipped cream were authentic as well. We were stuffed after the entrees but through teamwork, we succeeded in finishing the huge slice.  - Key Lime Pie - also excellent. Creamy mousse type and not too tart. Enjoyed the graham cracker crust here as well.

I wouldn't suggest you do that also, but if you must have steak, it'll be okay. I was worried that we wouldn't be able to get a table with no reservation at 7:30 on a Friday, but we were sat right away. As soon as you walk in you can see all of the cuts dry aging in a big windowed room with fans blowing. Beautiful marbling was on each cut. We all ordered the ribeye steaks with a couple of sides.I ordered the steak medium rare. It came out perfectly cooked. Like perfectly, the texture and doneness was perfect, but in terms of flavoring it could have used just a bit more. That bit more was perfectly solved with the salt shaker.

5.0,5/29/2017,"My family and I came here to New York for a spontaneous Memorial Day Weekend vacation. It being our last night here in this amazing city, we were craving for some good steak. Initially we were on the hunt for some prime rib that was near our hotel. After a few Google searches, we were led to this steakhouse.The first thing that catches your eye is a view of all the kinds of glorious meat, displayed in a room during it's drying age. Great way to attract the customersWait time: On a Monday night (Memorial Day) - We didn't place a reservation but were seated immediatelyService: Excellent! Our waiter/server PJ and another young man were very friendly, attentive, and accommodating. As stated, we were on the hunt for prime rib, and my family  (3 of us) all ordered it. Parents got medium-well and I got medium. However, after a few minutes of placing our order, PJ came back to regrettably inform us that they had 86'd the prime rib for the night. My mom, who clearly loves her prime rib, was vocally upset with the news. BUT, PJ had offered us an alternative, and honestly I'm so glad we stayed. We ended up getting the rib steak.  *Note: Future referencd, call in with a reservation to make sure whatever meat you want is availableFood: SO GOOD. For a first time experience, we all left happy and satisfied. We were all so very pleased with the perfect temperatures of our steaks and the amount of flavor, juicyness, and portion size that came with it. For sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes and asparagus. When we had leftovers to be packed up, the other guy that served us (wish I knew his name) was kind enough to give us a warm batch of mashed potatoes to go. Big thanks to him!Ambiance: Fine-dining, great atmosphere, staff was very welcoming. Vibe of the place overall was very pleasant.Closing thoughts:Coming from a tourist, I surprisingly really loved this place, even for my first time coming here. It's too bad that Gallagher's is only here in New York. I wish there was one back home in Chicago cause now, this place has become my favorite steakhouse.

4.0,5/15/2017,"Decent steakhouse in midtown. I came here for a Mother's Day lunch with my family and my boyfriend. They have a $29 lunch special which allows you to order an appetizer, entree and dessert  - it's a lot of food at a fair price! I ordered a Caesar salad, 10 oz filet mignon, and chocolate ice cream. As a table, we split a side order of asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was decent, but nothing really stood out to me. Since I became full during the second course, I ended up taking half of my filet mignon to go. My brother, who didn't order off the lunch special, snagged a creme brûlée during dessert. I was kinda jealous that wasn't an option for me. Although the lunch special offers a great deal, the menu can be a little limiting.Throughout the meal, the waiters were extremely attentive and friendly.

Not one of the better steaks we've had in the city.I ordered the tuna steak medium rare. It was far too fatty and also, it was a huge, thick cut almost in the shape of a cube as opposed to the thinner cut most restaurants usually give. There was a lot of fat and crusting along the outside, which I didn't love. Wasn't able to finish, which never happens for me! Though I commend them on the large portions. We also got mushrooms for our side, which were really good! But definitely overpriced. I loved the Gallaghers sauce--not necessarily on the steak, but just in general.

I know this place is legendary, and a heavy hitter in the NY steakhouse scene, but saying this is the best steak i have ever had would be a lie, and lie i do not on Yelp. My boyfriend and I made reservations her via open table, so that was a breeze. We were here on no special occasion, more of a- just because lets treat ourselves. We arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation because we knew we wanted to have a pre dinner drink at the bar. Checked in at the host station, and made our way over to the bar. We luckily saw a couple getting up so we grabbed those seats, otherwise the place was packed!The bartenders were moving at a lightning speed. Running circles around one another, grabbing different bottles. Both of our drinks we ordered were delicious and strong! As we sipped our drinks a glass was broken in the bar area- it happens. About 20 minutes later one of the hosts came over to let us know our table was ready.We had a great able for the evening. Great view to the open kitchen, yet it was also romantic and cozy, perfect for a date. We already knew what our main course was going to be- we studied the menu all week. We ordered our drinks, and this is where things got shotty. Our drinks took a while to come out. Diners that were seated after us had there drinks before ours.  Our server explained to us the long wait was because they could not find the certain whiskey my boyfriend requested...ugh ok whatever...We ordered our food for the evening. Started with the veal carpaccio app. It was a nice starter to a meat heavy meal. Very light and refreshing. I had the filet with the bone marrow. And he had the sirloin. We both agreed they were good, but we have had better. You could taste the smoke from the wood fire which was nice. But for the steaks being prime, aged, all that good stuff, it did not have that flavor that i was expecting, and tasted at other establishments. Our side of onion rings were good, i had to add salt to the creamed spinach. I would come back here for a drink at the bar for sure.

I don't know what cook everyone else ordered, but looking around the table, not one was over medium rare. This chef knows what he's/she's doing!)

3.0,4/14/2017,"I had a dinner before a Broadway show here. Surely they attract a crowd due to their location and well-known dry aged steak, cured and stored right in the front of the restaurant. You can see the room through the front window. Their steaks have excellent fragrance and flavor! My guest enjoyed the steak so I was very satisfied. It's a real bummer because I would truly loved to give them a 4 star review, but I have to minus the star due to their unreliable service. His demeanor was so lovely and  seemed experienced but he got every order specification wrong and was never present! First, I asked for dressing on the side for our salad which he originally kindly responded to (we even had a quick conversation about it). Yet, the salad came mixed with loads of dressing. I also ordered two glasses of wine in the very beginning but it never came. We had to look for our waiter, tell another waiter, but then it never came again so I had to ask again after we ate our appetizers. The worst part was when our steak arrived. Our steak was rolled in and delivered on a cart by an unknown waiter. It sat their for at least 5-7 minutes without being served. I was originally confused whether or not it was our steak but our waiter was not even around so we couldn't ask. Sadly, our steak was served to us afterwards. My medium-rare steak was turning close to medium. Luckily, I had a few bites of my medium-rare steak and it was delicious. Towards the end of my meal, the steak had become medium. Very, very sad for 10 oz of $45+ slab of delicious meat. I didn't express my frustration on the spot because I was with a guest and was also heading to a show afterwards. Overall, my guest was happy...but I left wondering where else I could have taken my guest.

Mom's ribeye was rare instead of medium rare and my porterhouse was medium well instead of medium rare. Fixed appropriately but such a waste of good meat due to inexperienced or unfocused chef work. Honestly expected higher class treatment being the elite steakhouse in NY. Like pulling out of chair for a lady or at least my elderly mom. There was a coat check in but refused to take our shopping bags... which made seating for two very uncomfortable. When you don't mind spending money for an experience, atmosphere, and high quality food, it truly puts a damper on things when you have a rude server who doesn't have time to explain things to you.

4.0,3/18/2017,"I was super excited to see a restaurant like this. I'm a big fan of dry aged beef, and have had a lot of dry aged beef at home. My local meat market where I live provide aging service and sell them at a a very reasonable price. Therefore the dry aged taste and texture is not unfamiliar to me. The pictures seen on yelp and the aging room told me that I had to give this place a chance. Immediately, I looked up OpenTable and they had reservations because of weather. We were stuck in New York on 3/14 due to severe weather warning, or should I say a March snowstorm. It was also a special day today, so I had to look for a place to eat. We arrived, told them we had a OpenTable reservation. They seated us immediately in the back of the restaurant, near the corner with a partial view of the kitchen. I questioned the host, ""How many lbs of steak is in the dry aged room?"" He responded with, ""I don't know in that factor, but I can tell you that we have around $250,000 worth of dry aged steak in that room."" My jaw totally dropped to the floor when I heard that. The main server was attentive and offered bread with menu right away. He told us the specials for the day and explained some details to us. I decided on the following:-Cesar Salad-52oz Dry Aged Tomahawk Cut (shared for 3 people). -Shrimp Scampi-Side order of baked spinach-Side order of sauteed mushrooms. I had a small request for the server. I wanted to take a picture of the Tomahawk raw before it hit the grill. He took me to back of the kitchen to fulfill my childish request =). The experience of going to the kitchen was awesome. I had the honor of smelling the dry aged aroma in the kitchen, like it was cut straight from the aging room. With all the excitement, I was left a little disappointed by the tomahawk. The serving wasn't presented so well. Wished they cut in front of us. The kitchen and second server didn't communicate too well either. The seat wasn't served too warm, it was lukewarm.. Yes, I understand you have to let it rest to cook through, but still.. The outer skin was too charred and we tasted too much of the burnt aftertaste. This also took away from the distinctive aged taste. I think the reason for this is because the cut was super thick, and we wanted it cooked to medium. It wasn't quite medium, but closer to medium rare. As for the other stuff.. Giant shrimps made to scampi style was great. Baked spinach was good. Sauteed Mushroom was just sauteed mushroom. 3.5, but rounded up to 4. The reason for this is because they did something for us during dinner.We celebrated a birthday that day. They gave us a cake, and did a quick happy birthday for our table. Thanks. Service - main guy for our table was super. Chatted with us, and was cheerful. The second guy who helped him wasn't as fun. Seemed like he was just there because it was a job.

For my birthday we came to New York for the weekend and decided it was finally time to try this highly rated steak restaurant. We ordered the filet mignon and the New York bone in steak with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were delicious and one order was more than enough to share between the two of us. In addition, the steaks and service were also great. About 4 hours later my boyfriend started feeling nauseous and had an upset stomach. Unfortunately, the remainder of his night (our last night in town) was spent in the bathroom. After reviewing our day we realized the only thing he had eaten but I had not was the steak sauce from this restaurant. I called Gallaghers to let them know that I believed my boyfriend had gotten sick from their steak sauce. I did not call with the intention of blaming them or asking for my money back. I just wanted to let them know so that this wouldn't happen to anyone else. However when I called, the man on the phone quickly became defensive and kept stating that there was no way it could be from them because food poisoning takes much longer to set in. He did not feel sympathetic to our situation at all and just kept repeating himself that there was no way it could be from them. He did not ask for my information, what we ate or even seem at all interested in the details of our meal . All I wanted to do was let them know to prevent this situation happening to anyone else. My complaint is solely towards to way this restaurant handled the situation. What started as a great meal in New York for my birthday turned into an unfortunate night in the hotel.

Aged steak was literally one of the best either of us had tasted in years of being foodies. Simple yet perfect mashed potatoes. The BEST sautéed spinach either of us have had. I enjoyed an excellency glass of Napa Valley Cabernet which was full and reasonably priced. Service: spot on. Never wanted for anything yet were never imposed on. Recommendations were exactly as described. Excellent conversation and character... when I jokingly asked if they were going to dribble salt down their arm like that silly guy on the interwebs, the second server picked up the shaker and gave our pre sliced steak an over the wrist spritz of salt. Just perfect service from Armando and his team. Location: on 52nd near several theaters and in a good spot mid town. Easy walk back to the Warwick which helped ease the fullness. Decor: same place since 1927.. 90 years old and looked impeccably appointed with obvious care and attention to maintaining the original decor.

3.0,2/28/2017,"I have said this before on Yelp: I am a connoisseur of steakhouses.  I have been to Smith & Wollensky, Peter Luger, The Palm, Keens, Delmonico's, Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille, Bobby Van's, Ben & Jack's, Uncle Jack's, Rothmann's, Gallaghers, the Bull & Bear (in the Waldorf), to BLT (in Washington, D.C.), to Shula's (in Indianapolis), and to Brumus in London (U.K.), (which is not a steakhouse, but the way they cook their cuts of meat--SO GOOD, they might as well be).  Mostly in New York, often in Long Island, often in D.C., and as far away as London (indeed, I have even been to the top steakhouses in Dhaka, Bangladesh!); I have been to these places to eat, and savor, steak.   Multiple, multiple times.  Yes, I have never been to a Morton's, or to Sparks in Manhattan (even though I worked at the United Nations for years).  But outside of that, I have more experience . . . than most.  Consistent with my past reviews, I think the only 5-star steakhouses are Smith & Wollensky and Peter Luger.  Next are all the 4-star (excellent, beyond delicious, on their own) steakhouses: Keens, Uncle Jack's, Delmonico's and Rothmann's.Next come the 3-star steakhouses, and I would put Gallaghers solidly in this category.  Mind you, if you are reading me for the first time, my view of a 3-star *steakhouse* is that it would be a 5-star restaurant in any other category.  I think steakhouses like this are worth the big prices customers shell out (if you can't afford a top-line steakhouse, don't go to one; there are economy/chain steakhouses that do a similar, but nowhere near as amazing, job well enough for someone who can't spend more than $60 on diner for two-ish people, go to that if you have not got the money to spend on a top-line steakhouse).The 3-stars are the ones that are still worth the amazing price, and are great steakhouses on a more absolute scale, they just aren't in the same league as those top-of-all-of-America steakhouses listed above (i.e., *relative* to the best--Smith & Wollensky, Peter Luger, Keens, Uncle Jack's, Delmonico's and Rothmann's--they are 3-star steakhouses).  So, in line with this, Gallaghers has amazing service, great creamed spinach, its cuts of meat are great, it cooks that meat very well, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is really great.  It is not a friggin' museum, like Delmonico's or Keens, but it is a very old establishment, that has the right ""mood"" to every corner of its rooms, and the Gallaghers Meat Locker is a really awesome thing to behold.  This is one of the best steakhouses on the far-West Side of Manhattan.  It is a *great* establishment.  Go, when you get the chance.",2,2,0,Bradford S.,"Chantilly, VA",38,119,750

Tonight, I was in a party of four with two of our guest being Japanese with limited English skills. Despite my asking the waiter - nicely and with humor - to slow down his speech, he rattled off the specials and instructions so fast I barely understood him. Throughout the meal, I felt the service was inattentive and gruff. I had to ask for water refills. But his cardinal sin was grabbing our $100+ bottle of wine with an inch or so left in the bottle and dumping it. When I questioned him, he said, you don't want that, it is just the sediment. The wine was a 2013 and there wasn't any noticeable sediment. No apology. No effort to make amends despite my very obvious dissatisfaction. There were so many things he could have done but didn't. The food was typical Gallagher's. I thought my rib eye was ok. The baked stuff shrimp and Dover sole special ordered by our female gusts looked great and they were happy. Sides were good. At these prices, though, I expect first class service and we caught the short end of that stick. Actually reminded me of the ""old"" Gallagher's where the ancient waiters were always rude to my Japanese guests.

However, we didn't mind waiting because we got seats at the bar. We were seated at the nice corner table. The bread they serve is delicious and warm.. I ordered spicy tuna poke, it was okay, not great. But I am not going to rate the restaurant based on tuna, I'm giving this review because of the amazing rib eye steak that was so flavorful, juicy and delicious! I asked for medium, and I got medium which makes me very happy because some places don't cook steaks the way you want, and you waste money... This place though, just amazing! My friend got bone in ny sirloin which was also delicious and a Caesar salad that was also good. For sides we ordered mashed potato, spinach, and asparagus. Mashed potato and spinach were good, asparagus were plain... it's like they were boiled and served with some sauce that I didn't like at all... Asparagus need some pepper/salt and oil.. for dessert we ordered chocolate layer cake and NY cheesecake. Both good, cheesecake better though. This was a great experience!

Talk about freshness. This Broadway-style restaurant is located in Theater District of NYC providing you with an upscale, but old-school feel.A group of friends & I traveled up to NYC from Philly for the day to celebrate a friend's birthday. We ended our night at Gallaghers. Thankfully we took the train down, because FOOD-COMA. Zzz...I started with the French Onion Soup, which was basic. I expected the cheese to be more melted and elastic, but it was just chunky; boring to eat. As for my entree, I had the Rib Steak,  requested to be cooked medium, but received rare, so I had to send it back. It was cooked perfectly when I received it the second time around. The steak wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but it was still enjoyable to eat. Each bite melted in my mouth. It was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the Lemon Sorbet, NY Cheesecake, Chocolate Layered Cake, and Creme Brulee for the table. The Lemon Sorbet was refreshing to eat; perfect after a heavy dinner. The NY Cheesecake and Creme Brulee was tasty and delicious as expected. The Chocolate Layered Cake was humongous, but mediocre as it was a bit dry.The service was a little slow. I expected more from Gallaghers as an upscale steakhouse. Our waters were not refilled at a timely manner and our server hardly checked in on us. When I had to send the steak back, I had to flag someone down since our server was nowhere to be found. I've been to other steakhouses that would wait for each person to check if their steaks were cooked at the right temperature before departing.

First of all, as soon as he took an order from us, he started grumbling about us picking tea for the drink since I was not 21, I could not drink any alcohol beverage and do not like pop at all. Then he goes, actually whispering to another waiters, ""Now I have to serve little kid and a cup of TEA!!"" with an emphasize on our selection of drink loudly as we could have heard. I am not that upset, but my mother seemed very worried and feel anxiety. After couple of minutes, he come to our table again and start putting a salad into two plates and tea into my cup, however, he INTENTIONALLY dropped some leaves onto the table and SO ROUGHLY poured wine and tea into our cup and glass of my mom.   In addition to that, he Tried to make as many noise of plates and utensils hitting each other while he was serving. Because all of these, I had to ask another waiter if I could talk to the manager about if the service we experienced was what is usually done at Gallagher's.

We both had rib eyes, med rare, tasteless, and one was so full of gristle I actually had to spit a chewed up bite in my napkin for the first time since I was a kid.As I was leaving I had to tell the host 3 times that the experience was awful, after he laughed it off the first two times I told him.By the way, when a 50 year old man walks into your establishment in full cowboy dress and he keeps his hat from the coat check,after checking his coat, you do NOT need to remind him to uncover for dinner while seated. Respect is expected, and should be assumed in a spot that an average check averages what Gallaghers averages.This 5 day, 1st timers trip to NY ended on this dinner, and was to be the cherry on top of what otherwise was an outstanding little getaway from Utah.Don't make the same mistake I did folks, really sucks!",2,5,0,Staci D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,0

He was discriminating, as No one was looking or complaining music was loud too in CA this never happened and I was trying my best to talk to my son at the moment.

5.0,2/1/2017,"One of my favorite steakhouses in the city, just not in my favorite location. Chose this place for my birthday one year since I had tickets to see Wicked on Broadway later that night, and I needed to find a nearby steakhouse since it's my tradition to enjoy a delicious porterhouse steak every year to celebrate. Highlights:- Porterhouse steak was cooked to perfection - rare and soaked in its own savory juices.- Service was amazing and attentive. They recommended one of my now favorite red wines to pair with our steak and also delicious side orders. - Interior looks like most other steakhouses (very large but cozy with dimmed lighting and Ron Burgundy style rich mahogany), but at the entrance they have a rows and rows of all their fresh beef cuts on display. The most beautiful marbling of meat ever.",0,0,0,Josie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,140,270

1.0,1/29/2017,"Known foodies, my daughter and I had to check out the cuisine at this famous steakhouse.  It is restaurant week in New York City and they offer a fixed menu including soup or salad, main coarse and dessert.  I ordered the Cesar salad, sliced filet mignon and cheese cake.  My daughter ordered the wedge salad, short ribs with mash potatoes and also the cheese cake.  My steak was cold dry and tasteless.  It had a tomato base  sauce that did nothing for the steak. I asked for medium well and basically it was cooked medium. My salad was wilted. My daughters mash potatoe was cold and tasteless.  Her short ribs was served in a barbeque sauce that did not enhance the flavor of the meat.  The only enjoyable thing about this meal was the bread which was delicious for this reason i gave them one star.  If your not going to put care and interest in the meals your serving for restaurant week specials, don't bother at all in joining restaurant week.  Truly disappointed.",1,0,0,Dulce L.,"Elizabeth, NJ",35,139,314

Their 10 oz fillet mignon reminds me of the 75-day dry aged delmonico streak at Bern's - juicy, tender, slightly seasoned to both preserve and enhance the flavor of the meat itself.I also ordered New York cheesecake after reading great reviews about it.

5.0,1/21/2017,"I've grown up eating dinner at NYC steakhouses, and have spent a couple of years working at one, so I'm familiar with all of the greats. That said, Gallaghers is on a whole other level -- which is evidenced by the dry aging room you can peek into as you walk past the restaurant on the street. Who ever thought that mold growing on meat would be so enticing?Literally everything on the menu is delicious, and while every time I visit I try to convince myself to try something new (one day, roast beef hash, one day .... ) I always find myself going back to that 10 oz. filet mignon. There aren't enough adjectives to describe it -- tender, juicy, savory, perfect. Get some roquefort to top it off and you're good to go. The onion rings and potato chips also can't be beat, which is why we always manage to go through two family size orders each for a group of four. I've also tried a few bites of my boyfriend's cheeseburger (a 10 oz patty!) and have to say it's probably the best burger I've ever had in my life. The fact that it's somewhere in the $15 range is incredible -- you can spend more at Bareburger for an inferior experience. As far as dessert goes, go with the cheesecake (usually every NY steakhouse's best fallback option).For the five or six times I've visited Gallaghers the service has been wonderful, with the exception of an early December holiday lunch with my family. Clearly it was packed given the season, but our server made it clear that he wanted our table to turnover ASAP, which made it difficult to sit back and relax. Typically, though, we're seated in a different section and tend to get the same server who is very friendly, conversational and helpful.

3.0,1/20/2017,"Steakhouse du jour when in Manhattan. The decoration is very classic, elegant and gives an old money vibe. We went for an early dinner before catching a Broadway show and were seated promptly. For appetizers we tried the lobster bisque and steak tartare, which were good but nothing memorable. For the main dish we ordered the classic New York sirloin and a Filet Mignon, both meats were juicy and flavorful but were brought to us way too long after the appetizers, to the point when we actually asked the waiters if they had forgotten about our order. For dessert, we split a creme brûlée that was pretty good even for a creme brûlée snob like me. Gallaghers has a beautiful ambiance and decor but the service time could be better, do not go if you're on a tight touristy schedule that day.

4.0,1/15/2017,"Came here on Saturday evening after Jersey Boys.  Place is very upscale and service was tops.  However, the food was about a 7 on a 10 scale. I think that the steaks (we had Porterhouse for two) lacked seasoning and were a bit tough for the dry aging process they claim to have.  It was sort of bland.  The starters, clam casino and French onion soup were ok.  The soup was very salty.   The sides for the steak, Mac and Cheese and sautéed string beans were just ok too.  My mac and cheese at home is much better.  The drinks were very good as was the complimentary bread and butter.  For a $300 tab for two people, I wish I was  more satisfied.   They also pack you in like sardines.   This is quite common in most NY restaurants.  There was a couple next to us, who we found out, are quite regulars of the city.  They told us they felt the same way.  They said the best steaks  around are Peter Lugers, Wolfgang's, Keens, and Quality Meats, in that order.  Hope this helps.",0,0,0,Greg G.,"Waterbury, CT",0,8,6

Great for his bday night in NYC.  Their bread they bring out is delicious and it comes with banana bread along with the normal cuts of bread (white, wheat etc) their butter comes on a small palate with salt crumbled on the top. Superb. We ordered the porterhouse steak for 2- medium and the macaroni and cheese side dish.  Our server (Adam) was amazing and explained everything in full detail for us...down to some off the menu specials. The porterhouse steak was AMAZING. It literally melted in our mouths and we were so stuffed we couldn't even finish it! The macaroni was superb as well. This place was the BEST last stop for us in NYC. It was also my hubbies birthday dinner and they gave us a chocolate raspberry desert. Needless to say we couldn't even touch it because of how stuffed we were...too bad we couldn't bring it with us to CA! Thanks Adam for a wonderful dinner...The only thing I would comment on is the seating.  They seated us at the bar when there were clearly tables available.

5.0,1/8/2017,"There may steakhouses as good in New York, but I doubt that any are better. Every element of our first visit was letter-perfect, from Teresa at the coat check to our incredible and wonderfully Irish lead server, PJ Hennessy (""like the cognac""), to Joe, the manager who made sure we were being perfectly taken care of by his team.A one-pound lobster cocktail made for sharing and group swooning. Caesar and chopped salads likely better than any you've had before. Perfectly aged steaks cooked perfectly over hickory coals that provide flavor but don't get in the way of that beefy goodness. (Even the chopped steak, made with sirloin, is delicious.) A great selection of excellent side dishes (especially the creamed spinach and the sautéed mushrooms). Desserts that are just over-the-top enough to complement the rest of the meal deliciously. And if you happen to enjoy any refreshing adult beverages before, during, or after your meal, their bartenders definitely have you covered with traditional and unique-to-Gallagher's options.Everything you could want a traditional, old-school steakhouse to be, Gallagher's is, and more. Yes, it's pricey, but no more so than other steakhouses that will not be nearly as satisfying or as much fun. Have a light breakfast, skip lunch, make the reservation, spend the money, and have a great meal and a memorable evening.

4.0,1/4/2017,"Great ambience....nothing beats a streak house with deep leather and wood paneling and this place delivers!  The food backs up the promise of the ambience as well!  The french onion soup was rich and cheesy (but they had no container so I could take my leftover soup?!  what's up with that??).  The wedge salad was good -- could have used a little more roquefort for my taste but I'm being picky. The iceberg was crisp and fresh and the beefsteak tomato was good as well.  The main attraction -- the steak was really, really good and helped to make me forget about the little miscues along the way.  I had the sirloin -- cooked on the bone and then sliced for you (the best of both worlds in my opinion, I get kind of lazy cutting steak!). It's served with a sauce (on the side thankfully since a good steak should stand on its own -- bare!) and it came at exactly the temperature I ordered.  The host that greeted and seated me was outstanding and even though I was a single I didn't get relegated to some obscure spot.  I had a comfortable table out in the open. That counts a lot to me.  The service was just okay (as others have noted). Not bad but not outstanding either.  Just okay.  The food makes up for the service deficiencies.  You've got all male waiters being pretentious in their service. That's part of the steakhouse ""thing"" and I'm actually okay with that.  I wasn't treated rudely at all and I was left alone to enjoy my meal.  Overall a really good experience and it's a place I would return to when I'm back in NY.  It's expensive, but actually no more so than the Capital Grilles or other ""chain"" steakhouses.  Good job Gallagher's!  Oh! and there's a pretty nice bar where you can eat also so that's an option.  Very close to all the theaters so if you're pre-theatre I would make a reservation.",0,0,0,Nancy G.,"Providence, RI",0,9,25

It had cognac,brandy,honey,lemon,egg whites,and sparkling wine. It was incredible.We got seated at 1030 which is no good because my gf was tired from the long day.

1.0,11/29/2016,"A college student celebrating an early birthday with her boyfriend decided to eat here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Biggest regret ever. It wasn't crowded and the atmosphere was intimate. They took our coats and seated us. We decided we only wanted to share a steak because we weren't that hungry for a full meal and it was only lunch time. The waiter gave us attitude telling us that it was unusual for people to share a meal as if it were a frowned upon thing to do. He rolled his eyes and told us if one person wishes to not eat then one steak would be enough. We ordered one New York City steak and onion rings and a baked potato and it was more than enough to fill both of us. We didn't even finish the onion rings. I feel like because the atmosphere of this place is so wealthy, they aren't welcoming to average people like college students even though they don't understand our occasion for wanting to treat ourselves here. I never had such an awkward time ordering food before. And when the food arrived, the baked potato is literally a potato and sour Creme on the side. That potato was $10 and it was so sad because there was nothing special about the potato. And the onion rings were mediocre too. The sparkling water we got was $8 and Unrefreshing. And lastly, the steak we shared was dry, hard, tasteless and not savory or juicy or delicious at all. I was really disappointed in eating here. Being from California, I am a big foodie and I love eating fine dining and fancy steaks but this place we decided to eat at in New York was beyond unsatisfying. Save your money and might as well eat steak at TGIF's because they will treat you right, it won't hurt your wallet and the steak will be tastier.",0,2,1,Kimberly H.,"Santa Ana, CA",34,77,112

What's even frustrating is that a gentlemen skipped us and he was offer service first when apparently the host saw that we were patiently waiting in line. I mean I will not argue about it but it was unprofessional to be offer service first just because you know the customer. We were finally guided to our table. We were given the dinner menu. The waiter then asked us what can he start us out with?, I told him let's start out with water first. After he return to our table, he didn't even give us the drink menu. He automatically assumed that we didn't want to drink anything. We ordered the baked clams casino for starter, porterhouse for two for entrees, Mac&cheese and creamy spinach for the sides. The clams tasted great . The steak wasn't cooked to the temperature I wanted it to be, but the sauce was good. The spinach was too salty. I like the layer on top of the Mac, it was crunchy. Water was refilled every now and then. I guess they wanted us to leave quicker because I already saw new napkins and utensils set on the table next to us so that they can reset everything on our table. They kind of rush us out.

The manager, Brian, said he only had a 6:45pm available. I told him I'd call him back as we needed to decide. When we called to confirm the 6:45pm reservation he informed me that it was already taken. (It couldn't be THAT crowded i thought to myself). Needless to say I was a bit disappointed and was about to hang up, but he then said,  ""Hold on, you know what? Come in and I'll find you something. Just ask for me when you get here. We'll make it work somehow."" So we went. When we got there the place was PACKED. People were getting turned away left and right. I thought there was no way we'd get a table. But then I found Brian, explained who I was, and he found us a lovely table within minutes. I can't thank Brian enough for his hospitality. The minute I met him I could see that he really cared about his job and wanted to make the experience a great one for all his customers. In fact, the service in general was top notch, which made all the difference. Now as for the food, it was delicious. The best part (aside from the incredible steak of course) is the bread basket they give you at the start of your meal. Along with a delicious fresh baked assortment of breads comes a banana nut pound cake that is TO DIE FOR. Everything was super fresh.

After all it's some of the best steaks I've devoured are in NYC. First off entering the building my smile brightens up by the site of a massive dry aged meat locker you walk past upon entering the establishment. Now that steak rests in this flesh musalium for over 21 days before they meet you for dinner. Once you stopped drooling a gentleman will greet you and escort you till a table where a team of waiters will serve your needs while dining for the next 90 minutes. I've come for lunch on many occasions and dined on the skirt steak which is only served at lunch time or French Dip ( amazing with onions in it ). Not many places serve skirt steak yet I'm always drawn to ordering it here. They really marinate correctly cause it melts in your mouth. For those diners who want to keep it simple then try the $29 (3) choice menu of appetizer , main coarse & desert.My dinner carnivorous desires takes me to the rib eye, corn shucked off the cob and Gallagher's home made chips & Caesar salad. Maybe on occasion I'll grab a PORTERHOUSE for 2 ! The PORTERHOUSE allows you to sample two sections of beef cooked on the bone. Depending on mood and my lady of the night I may enjoy the NY Side of the Filet side cooked medium for the juiciest flesh explosion is your mouth.

He gave us recommends & even told of some items he didn't love - which is rare.

They go above & beyond. Even to the point the people sitting next to us ordered the brussel sprouts but didn't like them & he went over to ask if everything was ok & they mentioned they didn't care for the brussel sprouts so he took it off the check.

My Filet Mignon......was not so good. I asked for my steak to be Medium Rare and it came Medium. It was quite cooked and the inside was completely pink. There was also no fat whatsoever on the meat either and it was a really tough piece of steak. Really lean and I don't recall much flavour other meat and salt. I tried best as I could to just eat my steak as is, but it was really tough and painful to chew (hello wisdom teeth) so I had to mention it to my server that my steak was not cooked Medium Rare. Service was really good, they apologized and quickly took care of it. I had a new steak come out and they actually watched me cut it which was a little nerve wracking, LOL. It was Medium Rare! At least, the first couple slices or the outside was. It was an uneven sear and the middle of the steak was more like Rare instead. The texture and taste was much better (slightly more beefier?), but it was still a really lean piece of meat and tough to chew. Creamed spinach and potatoes were really salty! They're good but way too much salt, it was enough to sting my tongue and left me quite thirsty. I tried their Porterhouse which was good, especially the fattier cuts. However, it was the same case as my steak where it was generally lean and tough to chew, and not much flavour either (it just tasted like beef/meat nothing really going on) despite being cooked medium rare as well. Chicken Parm and Beef were good, nothing special. Dessert was great, cheesecake was creamy and smooth. Strawberry sauce was actually really good, perfectly sweet and very strong. Key lime pie was good as well, hint of lime and custardy, although I much prefer the cheesecake. I was quite stuffed from the lunch special, they do give good portions but I feel like the food was really mediocre. Hearing that this was one of the best places to get a steak in NYC, I'm quite disappointed since I don't feel like the meat was very good and didn't live up to the hype. They couldn't cook my steak the way I wanted to either, twice, which was really disappointing. Prices were also very steep which is understandable, but the food just didn't match up.",3,1,0,Irene L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",51,54,80

3.0,8/15/2016,"I came here yesterday for RW lunch with a few friends.  Only some of us got the RW menu though.The waiter was super nice and quite attentive so that was good.To start, both of us got the ceasar salad which had this odd kick to it.  A little bit sour at the end which was kind of weird.  It was also slathered in dressing - probably should have told them to put it on the side.  Regardless, it was okay.  The presentation didn't look so appetizing though.For the entree, I got the short rib which was recommended by the waiter plus he said it's good if you're not TOO hungry which I wasn't.  It was actually a pretty decent amount of food.  A lot of mashed potatoes and this super tender large slab of short rib.  There was no point for a knife so my fork was able to go right through.  So tender.  There were also some fatty bits in it which made it more delicious.   A relatively solid choice if you're into beef and mashed potatoes.  I would have liked to see some sort of veggies there though.My other friends both got the beef hash which was told by the waiter to get if they are SUPER hungry which I guess, they both were.  It literally came partially burnt on top plus it didn't look like any beef hash I'd ever seen.  It was if they cooked it in a pan, left it there to slowly burn on the bottom to get that crisp but left it there a little too long and then just flipped it over onto the plate.  The beef was also pretty burnt as well.  They both complained that it was pretty salty too.  Neither of them finished.For dessert, I got the cheesecake and my friend got the key lime pie.  Both were just okay - the cheesecake was a little on the watery side.Overall, just okay.  My friend didn't enjoy it so much though and my other friend thought it was just okay too.",0,0,1,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",202,214,33

Maybe because I am young and Asian he assumed I will not pay tip and thus provided no service at all. I also find his request offending given he knew it very well that he provided no service (not once did he ask how was the food and whether we need anything) but still asked me for tip.

4.0,8/6/2016,"The meat locker up front does create curiosty from passersby. The restaurant ages the meat 28 days before serving to its customers. A good practice for a steak house, from what I heard. Yet, this place doesn't believe in taking temperature of the cooking steaks. Tough luck if you're very precise of how well you want the steak to be cooked. Waiters will warn you again of this fact when taking orders. Many football players' posters and drawings are displayed on the walls. Well, this place does have a 80-yr old history since prohibition years.From Restaurant Week menu, I ordered Beefsteak Tomato & Onion for appetizer. My friend got the Wedge Salad and lobster bisque. Waiter brought out 2 big slices and tomato, 1 big slice of onion in the middle and salad dressing on the side for me. It for sure doesn't take a cook to prep this plate. The lobster bisque looked amazing, however. Soup was poured into the lobster plate at the table. For entree, my friends got Sliced Filet Mignon (Caramelized Peppers & Onions, Asparagus, Roasted Garlic Jus) and 10 oz. Filet Mignon (Creamed Spinach, Mashed Potatoes, and $10 Supplement). I got the Short Ribs of Beef Braised with Tomatoes, Molasses, and Vinegar, Mashed Potatoes. Loved the Sliced Filet Mignon, which came with a surprise poached egg on top. Delicious by the look itself! 10 oz. Filet Mignon was served medium rare, instead of medium as ordered. Again, they don't take temp of the steaks~. The steak was tender but not exactly butter-knife-cut-through soft. My Short Ribs rocked. It's tender, juicy and a bit fatty. Excellent with smashed potato.  We finished the fulfilling meal with Raspberry Sorbet for dessert. Yum. Do order steaks here. All 4 stars were for the short ribs and sliced filet mignon.",0,0,2,Chau H.,"Manhattan, NY",286,63,171
3.0,8/6/2016,"Pleasant experience but falls slightly short against the top steakhouses in NYC. This place makes a great Bloody Mary, offers a traditional upscale steakhouse ambiance, professional and courteous waiters and a check to match. We ordered the French onion soup, porterhouse for 2, creamed spinach and gallagers (potatoe) chips. While most of the dishes were good to very good, there was nothing exceptionally notable or having that wow factor. To be honest, I'm being a very harsh critic and I am matching this restaurant against the likes of Peter Lugers. The porterhouse presentation was excellent but I noticed the lack of salt that would have made the perfect char on the outside. There were also some fatty portions that were difficult to cut thru which tells me they haven't quite perfected the aging process. The saving grace was the great staff and dining experience that gets 5 stars but if you are looking for the perfect steak, this is probably not the place.",0,0,0,Ray L.,"Manhattan, NY",59,103,82

The short rib was tender and flavorful and the steak & eggs was a generous portion and are probably better choices for RW...The cool looking meat locker in front of the restaurant is where we were told they age the steaks for 30 days.

There is also a bigger dining area towards the back of the establishment.  There are also high seats by the walls in the bar area, which is more dimly lit if you're looking for a more intimate atmosphere.Service at these high end steak houses are all very good and professional.  For a party of four, we went for a sirloin (medium) and porterhouse for two (medium rare).  Also a few appetizers which was more than enough.Hamachi appetizer - this raw yellowtail dish was very good, small portions, but would recommend! 5/5Sirloin - not bad, what I expected from a sirloin steak, but very dully seasoned. 4/5Porterhouse - we said medium rare but it was more like rare. The meat was very hard to chew. But they did offer to put it back on the fire for us, which helped.

2.0,6/2/2016,"Since i travel a lot for business purposes, i get a lot of travel references on taste, meal quality, steak quality etc. Well, i went to Gallaghers Steakhouse expecting a great steak and a great service. I wanted to compare the quality to the Argentinian and Uruguayan cuts, because in my opinion they are the best in matters of steak cooking and ""parrila"". Everything was excellent. However when the waiter asked me how i wanted my steak cooked, i asked for medium well. I got a condescending ""are you sure?"" reply, insisting that i should have the steak the way it is served traditionally by the house. I politely insisted in medium well: pink inside. However the steak arrived raw inside. After that the waiter asked if i wanted it cooked again, and since i didn't want to carbonize the steak, i ate it as it was. I like to think that i'm an elegant person in regards of complaining. I think experienced waiters should recommend and warn customers but i somehow got a condescending tone out of his ""cooking suggestion"". It sounded like ""hey, you don't know shit about steak cooking levels, let me help you"". However i did. And my taste is not like his taste. Sorry. I wouldn't recommend the place to a friend unless he likes raw meat. I can get better cuts, cooked to my taste, with 1/3 of the price here in Uruguay, where i am now. Sorry Gallaghers.

5.0,3/15/2016,"Wasn't sure whether I wanted to bother seeing if it lived up to the hype but we were seeing a show in the neighborhood and a lot of born and bred New Yorkers told me they had great memories of the place since it's been here for decades. It's changed a bit since then, but only for the better as it's a bit more elegant now. The steaks are incredible! My husband had the prime rib since it came highly recommended and I had the filet mignon. Both were superb. I wouldn't hesitate to use the word ""succulent"" and I'm fussy both about cuts and if they dare to overcook it. Seared to perfection on the outside but definitely medium rare as I ordered it on the inside and it melted in my mouth. You can definitely taste the difference the aging process makes in a good piece of meat. Also tried the crab cake which was mostly crab (and not a lot of breading) just the way a crab cake should be and my husband had a soup which he liked. The broccoli rabe was also tasty, as were the fries, and the side dishes are MORE than enough for two people to share, although they will cost you extra as everything is a la carte. Be forewarned that you may consider dinner a bit pricey. Though it's actually normal for the quality and the area it's not cheap. If you're looking for a bargain or ""family style"" dining this isn't the place. The service couldn't be beat. We wanted to have a couple of drinks and relax before ordering and our server Patrick gave us plenty of time and space while still managing to be there when we needed him. His timing was wonderful and he took good care of us as did several others there. They seem to work as a team. The place is lovely. I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar after work and I may try one of their specialty drinks sometime as they looked good. Drink prices were as expected and we usually drink martinis. We have already contacted friends about dining with us there in the future as we will definitely be going back. As a matter of fact, I'm trying to talk the hubby into meeting me at work and having dinner there again soon.  Addendum....took some friends back here for a late lunch on Sunday and there is a great price fixe menu.  Food and service were, once again, spectacular.",0,0,0,Tina P.,"Manhattan, NY",20,53,0

When the steaks came (porterhouse & ribeye) I didnt like that they were weren't hot or warm. They were about room temperature. Flavor-wise it could have used a bit more salt or butter or something. Where this place REALLY shines is the service. They were very professional and pleasant and non pushy throughout the whole meal (we were there for quite a while catching up and just chatting). P.S. This also means that the noise level was perfect. I've been to steakhouses where I got so cranky because my whole party was unable to hear eachother and have a normal conversation like normal human beings. Wolfgangs, I'm looking at you. Anyway, back to the service - We all felt like they went above and beyond to make us feel special.

No one in our company ever sends back food but all three couples sent back all of our steaks to be put on the grill for a little longer.

We all order our own special dessert coffee and sambuca which wasn't even brought out properly and our desserts. When they brought it all out nothing happened for my boyfriends birthday.

However... it was very refreshing. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe and sweet with balsamic vinaigrette dressing which I choiceEntree:Lamb chops: It comes with creamy spinach and mashed potatoes. Those were amazing. The lamb chops were also perfectly cooked in medium rare. Well worth the $5 supplement10 oz Filet: I sub the side with the asparagus with onion and tomatoes bc I already had the spinach and mashed potatoes from the other dish. The filet is over charred on the outside and very burnt. The steak sauce is very strong and taste like spaghetti sauce.Dessert:Ice cream + Sorbet. The vanilla ice cream was very creamy and sweet. Lemon sorbet was super sour. Raspberry sorbet was great.Like the other reviews I had maybe 3 different servers coming by and disappearing.

4.0,1/15/2016,"I had the prime rib (medium rare) and while it was very good - there was just seemed to be way too much fat on my cut.  I definitely expect fat in the cut, but there was an awful lot to cut off.  I do consider myself a bit of a prime rib connoisseur and this was the fattiest prime rib I've ever had.  I don't mean the fat that is marbled in the meat.  I'm talking about the fat on the trim.  That being said, I still enjoyed it very much, though.  It was tender and delicious.  The filet mignon that my friend had (medium) was very good as well.  We had for sides - baked potato, hash browns, and broccoli.  All were excellent but I notice the hash browns were far more well done than I usually notice from other steakhouses.  Good if you like a crunchy hash brown.  The atmosphere was similar to other major steakhouses I've been too - bustling when it's busy.  You never go to a steakhouse and expect a quiet moment.  Like most places, the seating is close enough that if you would likely need to move your table to get in or get up.Overall, I had a very positive experience.",0,0,0,Joseph Y.,"New York, NY",42,21,2

4.0,1/7/2016,"So glad we randomly, last minute decided to go here; for Gallaghers sure provided a great dining experience for us :)As said, we came here last minute on a complete whim, after aimlessly trying to make late dinner reservations at other locations that of course come to find out, were completely booked ( our fault for not booking earlier) when I remembered this place that was close to our hotel. We came in, the place was packed, however we manged to get a seat fairly quick :)We ended up getting a great table for 3. Service was phenomenally prompt and professional from the moment we were seated. The menu is exquisitely, mouth watering appealing - everything sounded good!For starters, we ordered drinks. I ordered a glass of red wine. My brother in law and his fiance, ordered some type of cocktails that I cannot recall. For food, considering it was a steak house and that the only steak I really eat is Rib Eye, I ordered their Rib Eye  - a 22 ounce Rib Eye! I know, they unfortunately did not have a smaller size, so I was stuck with the 22 ounce and I really wanted steak. I also requested it be cooked medium rare .Fellow companions ordered filet mignon, as well as as a side of broccoli and maybe something else. French Onion soup arrived first, looking sinfully delicious - and devilishly delicious it was! Hands down, probably the best French Onion soup I have ever had - and filling! Main entrees then later arrived, looking succulently appealing, while not to mention, incredibly generous in portion! They didn't joke about that steak being a 22 ounce, hot damn. I could only eat a little less then half of the steak, but it truly was outstandingly delicious - juicy, seasoned to perfection, and cooked to a medium rare delectable-ness. I of course took the rest to take back to my husband in the hotel room that did not join us due to the fact that he was a little tired and worn out from the long day.Overall, outstandingly prompt, professional service. Great, classic steakhouse environment and some exceptionally delicious food ( pricey) but well worth it. Also, keep in mind most of their entrees and sides, are enough to share for two - so with that, all the more worth the steeper prices :)",7,2,3,Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",781,1068,666

Although the restaurant was really busy, the environment was really pleasant and relaxing once we sat down.Our server, Nick, recommended the filet mignon so we got two orders of that and one of the lamb chops, and a side of Creamed Spinach. We also got a half bottle of wine from their wine list which had a lot of variety on the full bottles, but less variety on the half bottles. Our food was really good, the service was amazing, and at the end we asked if we could keep the little folder the receipt came in as a souvenir. At that point, Nick brought us a couple more receipt folders as well as matches so we could each have our own souvenir, which was really nice of him.

4.0,12/28/2015,"Date of service: June 3, 2015Meal: Dinner, dine inAll Ratings out of 10:Quality of food: 8Food to Spend Value: 7Quality of Service: 8Overall Rating: 8Sometimes the primal carnivore takes a hold of me, and there is nothing like a great steak to satiate such an innate instinct. Gallagher's is a very old steak house in Manhattan with a lot of tradition, and the reviews looked great, so I went there for dinner with a couple of colleagues to see if it could quench my carnivorous urges.You know you are walking into a place that takes pride in their steaks when they gladly display the source of the steaks to you. Gallagher's has a meat locker right up front full of the most beautiful cuts of meat. Seeing this got me more excited about my impending dinner, as I could see that the bar for quality was super high. After deliberating over a number of delicious sounding options, we decided to start with the Baked Clams Oreganata appetizer. I also decided to get a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. The clams were served baked on the half shell in an Oreganata style, meaning they had a oregano breadcrumb topping that gave them a bit of an Italian feel. The clams themselves were tender yet firm, and the topping made for a delicious start to the meal. The Bisque was extremely creamy and uber flavorful. Each spoonful was very robust tasting, with a very nice blend of seasonings, and the lobster in the soup was very tender and delicious, culminating in an amazing bowl of soup.Gallagher's is a steak house, and my inner carnivore was ready to take hold, so I absolutely had to order a steak. I wanted a big steak, and they certainly had many to choose from! After a lot of back and forth with myself, including asking the waiter many questions, I decided to go with the Veal Porterhouse, medium rare. We also ordered Brussel Sprouts and Asparagus to share as sides since they were a la carte. The steak was massive, and the hickory log grilled taste came out very nicely. The steak was very juicy and full of flavor, and it was prepared perfectly medium rare, with each bite melting in my mouth. The asparagus was served as jumbo spears (my preferred way of having asparagus), and they were prepared with a nice seasoning and had perfect firmness. The Brussel Sprouts were also quite delicious, and the entire meal was completely delightful.I was pretty full already, but the dessert menu looked amazing. Normally a key lime pie on any dessert menu would be an automatic for me, but the Blueberry Upside Down Cake caught my eye, so I went with it instead. Though I cannot comment on the key lime pie, I was not disappointed with my choice. The cake itself was delicious, the blueberry glaze had a nice sweet flavor and complemented the cake perfectly, and the topping of vanilla ice cream made the entire thing completely decadent.The waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful with all the menu questions we had. The atmosphere was really neat, as it had an old timey classy feel but with a modern updating. All the food that came out was prepared very well and was delicious. The food was pricey, but not as high as similar places I have been to in NYC, so though being expensive the overall value was still very good. The entire dining experience was very satisfying, from the satiated taste buds, to the full stomachs, to the enjoyable atmosphere. Gallagher's is definitely more of a special occasion type of place, but it comes highly recommended, particularly for when you have those deep carnivorous urges.",2,0,1,David B.,"Edmonds, WA",56,255,673

2.0,11/7/2015,"I was so excited to finally try that place ""with all the steak in the window."". Unfortunately, it wasn't a great experience. We started with a dozen oysters, not so great. We had half east coast, half west. The east were smaller than I expected and lacking that awesome oyster brightness I expected. The west were pitiful, tiny and tasteless. Not the $32 dozen I was expecting. I wonder if it being a Monday night they were leftovers from the weekend. Next we had the wedge salad, which couldn't be worse. Browned lettuce, tiny bits of bacon, almost none really. And served with a dressing that destroyed the richness the wedge should be. Gallagher's should make a trip to Morton's and try a real wedge salad. Since it was the second salad we were served already (the waiters brought the wrong salad first), we just didn't have the patience to send it back. We split the 16oz. NY Strip, medium rare. I was told it's one of three steaks that gets dry aged in the window. I was expecting at least some aged taste, but I got none. The steak was cooked perfectly, looked awesome (check out the picture), but lacked seasoning and taste. Overall very disappointing. Our side was Lyonaise potatoes, which are a dish I get frequently at other steakhouses. This was the worst I've ever had. Dried up potatoes, some hard and crispy, onions undercooked, lack of seasoning, lack of flavor. No decadence that you normally get from either lard or bacon grease in the potatoes.Key lime pie was actually the bright spot. Great crust, nice lime tartness, layer of creme on top.

Our server Adam was not only professional in his demeanor, his knowledge of the menu as well as what needed to be added or subtracted was evident.Our dinner started with a fresh Caesar salad that was delicious. With that hint of anchovies and the fresh egg yokes, you can't beat it.  After another round of drinks, our main course was Filet Mignon 10oz with a Bone marrow crust and a New York Sirloin with sautéed broccoli and a baked potatoes.   The steaks were delicious and well-cooked and juicy with that crispy fat.As with all great steak houses, we were not rushed even though it was late.  Then when we thought we could not eat anymore, desert of Crème Brulee.  OMG!  That's it.  A after diner cordial and we rolled out of there.    Oh yea this is for the guys, the men's room is straight out of the early 30s.  You will see.So if you want that NY experience, go to Gallagher's.",0,0,0,Kahoona S.,"Barnegat, NJ",35,33,11

If you are making a reservation, see if you can request a table that isn't along the bench seat. Where I was, the tables have about 8 inches between them and all of the guests on one side share a bench seat. This was not an ideal situation since I had two damned kids to the right of me. WHO takes their spawn out to a high end steak house in NYC on a Saturday night? They can't appreciate the kind of food served. Geez folks. Go some place else and let the adults enjoy themselves. So yeah, I had this six year old boy CONSTANTLY kicking the bench seat with the back of his foot for the better part of my dining experience. Joy. The constant yammering from their table was also not so much.The service was a bit off. Yeah, I know. It's a Saturday night. I've been to at least five other steak houses in NYC in the recent past where this isn't an issue. Our server had a large round table behind us that was taking his time and attention. I expect more for the type of $$$ spent on this meal.They don't have enough wine lists. When I asked for one, I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE WAS DONE. Are you kidding me? Make a call to the printers and get a few more made...I have never had this experience at any other restaurant.The steak I ordered was good but not great. I know my rib-eyes. I rate it at 93 out of 100. Once again, those who have been to steak houses on a regular basis will know what I mean.

Lots of people out on the street stand still for taking pictures because it´s so impressing to see all those accurately divided cattle. You can see how they run the mouth water.One thing is really important to know: Never go there without a reservation! And NEVER do this on a weekend (Friday included)!!!

So we were this time but we could stay at the bar for having some beers.In Gallagher's expects international and wonderfully mixed clientele: rich French tourists who want to run the first fur mid-October, cool natives, completely relaxed in blue jeans, Tees and sneaker, ordering a 200 bucks dinner. Everybody can be as he wants to be - I like that!And like everywhere else in New York you get equal with the locals very easy.We got one of those high tables opposite the bar, left hand from the entrance.I love the big and neat damask napkins (my fetish) and first of all we had delicious fresh bread and e yummy spread.Ou waiter this night was Adam and he was PERFECT! Friendly, courteous, not pushy, funny and enjoyable motivated. We chose a New York Strip, without bone and not sliced, with french fries (no sweet potatoe fries available) and green asparagus. Accompanied by an ice cold Bud - GREAT!I shall be brief:French fries: Perfect!The steak: Perfect!The asparagus: Perfect!The beer: Perfect!After dinner suddenly they served a pretty big fruit platter: strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple and cantaloupe - everything!that was on the house because of the fac, that we had o wait so long for our table.

3.0,10/14/2015,"The meat in the window made me run in here thinking everything must taste like butter... but maybe my taste buds are ridiculously spoiled but I was ever so slightly disappointed. We ordered: veal porterhouse, filet mignon 14 oz., 1/2 dozen oysters, side of mushrooms, side of Mac and cheese, glass of Cab, and a glass of draft beer (dinner for two... we had left overs since we ordered way too much).The half dozen oysters are 3 west coast and 3 east coast. I normally prefer west coast but the ones served here we're ridiculously tiny... tiny as in nearly invisible to the eye and wondered if the oyster fell off during it's trip to our table. Filet mignon was a bit dry. It wasn't my order but when I tasted it although cooked medium and not medium rare it was a bit dry. The veal porterhouse was cooked properly as medium rare but there was no taste. I thought it mentioned their meats were cooked over firewood but I tasted no other flavors and it tasted a bit bland. The most surprising was the steaks were served on cold plates. I thought the norm was for steaks to be served on warm plates... but then I could be wrong. I have had some incredible steaks in Chicago and Los Angeles and perhaps my expectation was too high. After reading more reviews wished I ordered the bone in sirloin or at least the porterhouse instead.",2,2,0,Jessica L.,"Downey, CA",200,182,433

My wife enjoyed the gazpacho with crab meat and I had the wedge salad; both were good. The absolute highlight of the meal and Gallagher's raison d'être was the porterhouse for two, cooked medium. Deliciously tender, melt in your mouth beef sirloin and filet. The dry aging they do is so tasty and noticeable.

Was once turned away at the door by some guy, who didnt work there-there was a bunch of limos and right as I walked away a bunch of old grey hair guys in long black coats came out....needless to say I came back another night. But hey thats NYC.I was alone, in town on biz and decided to go again. As usual, it as primo.I sat at he bar and both guys were friendly and took good care of me. I orderd the boneless NY, with a side of spinach, sauteed. I ordered medium and it was perfect. The spinach was excellent.The wine was also good. Overall, this is what a steakhouse should be. It isnt cheap, but if you are alooking for cheap maybe hit your local sizzler, as a good steak is never going to be cheap.Also, if you are alone ask for the half order of sides, and they will  accomodate.

The waiters were very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu, with great recommendations. Also before the order was put in we were asked if on a time schedule to better accommodate us. I thought that was a good jester being that NYC is always hustle and bustle. First I had the French onion soup that was delicious. It was hot, cheesy and loaded with onions. Great for two, my husband and I shared it. We then went right to our porterhouse for two medium cooked, pure perfection. We chose creamed spinach as our side dish again perfect!

4.0,9/21/2015,"This is really such a guy's place. Very traditional with the male wait staff outfitted in white cotton jackets and long white cotton aprons making them look as though they just walked out of the butchers shop. A wonderful selection of great whiskey and a very serviceable wine list.   I have to say that for the price I am not convinced of the value. My onion soup had dry papery pieces of onion. Even though the soup was good it is really inexcusable for a $12.00 bowl of soup that they cannot be careful enough to peel the onions properly. That was the opening to my meal. Kind of a sour taste after spending $104.00 plus tip. I had the beet and arugula salad that was very nice and $14.00. The salad was moderately sized and just about right. I skipped sides based on price and advice that they are very large, even the half size. My steak was the 10 oz fillet which was perfectly done and the tomato based dipping sauce was absolutely perfect, a superb break from traditional sauces. In all I had a very nice meal but I felt as though I spent too much. If you are concerned you are probably not coming here. I would expect that if you are willing to spend the price you are likely to enjoy your meal. For me I have found plenty of other places that intrigue my palate more at more reasonable prices.

5.0,9/18/2015,"What's left to say about a classic, best, original steak house that hadn't been said already? My wife and I were heading to another restaurant further east but decided the walk was way too far for our 7:00pm Broadway show. We started walking towards Broadway and passed Gallagher's and saw the meat locker in the window. I have passed that many times and never ventured in. I decided maybe we should go in and just grab a quick burger at the bar. We decided to give it a go. We only had about an hour or so before the show. We went inside and the bar seats were all taken. There were higher tables against the wall and plenty of seating. We decided to stay. When  we went inside we told the host we had a show at 7:00pm. We sat at the table and immediately (Jay?) our waiter appeared with the menu and knew we had a show to attend. After looking at the menu we decided to hold off on the chopped steak and we would split a rib eye steak. I wasn't sure how the waiter would react. We told him, and his next question was  should he slice it. That was awesome.  He asked about a salad and potato on the side. We mentioned the chopped salad and the baked potato and he said he will divide it all. He said, for time purposes, he will bring it out together. That was a great idea. Amazing. The bread came and that was delicious. The meal came and it was perfectly divided and even left the bone. What a delicious ribeye. Cooked medium rare perfect. The potato and salad was superb. The meal was a little over $100 without drinks and it was the best meal I had in years. The service was awesome too.

4.0,9/16/2015,"Every time I come to Gallagher's, it feels as if I'm at ""the stock market doing a business"" because this place makes you feel like a grownup doing grownup things. It's the type of place that smells of many leather-bound books and rich mahogany catering to important people, but their lunch menu is surprisingly a great value. For $25 you get an appetizer, an entree, and dessert. I've only been here for work lunches, but each and every meal was a positive experience. The food is consistent, service is expedient, and the atmosphere is superb. My favorite dishes include the roast beef hash, the prime rib sandwich, and the chopped steak. The cuts of beef are top notch, and you can't go wrong with any option.

4.0,9/2/2015,"Was on our way to east side, but changed our minds last second and navigated ourselves here instead. I've been wanting to come here for sometime because one day I just happened to stumble upon their window where they dry-age their beef. It looked spectacular, but back then I was predominantly not eating much meat; I said to myself if I were going to start eating meat again, once my body is fully adjusted, I will be back here.And I am glad I did. Starting with the atmosphere and service. We got to the restaurant around 2:45 the place was pretty empty and we were seated almost immediately. The server was nice, it is a nice lazy afternoon, I felt bad for having to make him run around. The decor and atmosphere is pretty nice, pictures on the wall, gave the place a little Italian homey feel, made you feel like you stepped into Good Fellas or the Godfather or something like that, very mobster-esque. We noticed most customers/people at the restaurant we a little on the older end, but I like that, adds to my imagination, as if they were ""doing business"". The thing that I was worried about was them turning us away, cause the place seemed pretty classy and I was wearing baggy shirt and pants (literally I had people tell me I look like I was wearing a bag), but luckily they didn't mind.We ordered with Porterhouse for two and Lyonnaise as a side, no appetizers or anything. So first thing we got was the bread basket. I after getting my first piece of bread I was in. The bread was still warm and really moist in the middle. There were three to four types of bread, which varies in texture and taste. The plain bread were crispy on the outside, loved the crust, and soft in the middle. The sweet bread was really moist and soft, it had raisins in 'em.The Porterhouse arrived to our table perhaps a little over 20 minutes later? The steak was really nice, we ordered medium rare, which is the way I like my steak. It was cooked really nicely, however, the temperature was a little cold. I realized after watching the other table, that is the way they serve it. I think it is kind of sad, because I definitely like to eat my food warm to hot and not lukewarm or cold.But besides that, the beef was really good. The filet mignon is really tender, it kind of felt like raw tuna in the middle, which I find extremely succulent. The sirloin was also really nice and juicy. What we loved most about the steak was that although it was a little cold, but the outter surface was still grilled/seared to perfection, it is really crispy. The steak itself isn't as flavorful as some of the other steaks I've eaten in New York, but texture wise, I really enjoyed it.As for the side, it is a little on the oily side, but good. The potato are pan seared nicely, it was cooked to the point that it almost turned into a potato hash but not yet. Overall, I do think I could come back here. The food is good, the atmosphere made me feel very badass. Next time, I would maybe ask for my steak to be hot when they serve it.",2,0,0,Allison C.,"New York, NY",35,68,299
4.0,9/2/2015,"I was pleasantly surprised at the friendly, attentive and professional service here.  Also, unlike many steakhouses in NYC that tend to have a more traditional decor/atmosphere, Gallaghers nicely blended the contemporary and traditional. You still get the feel of a traditional steakhouse but it doesn't feel old and dark. Everything from the white tablecloths to the bright open dining room gives a breath of fresh air to the steak eating experience.  Our porterhouse was nicely prepared to a nice medium-rare, but the fillet mignon was a bit too well done (but I blame my friend for ordering a fillet in the first place anyway ;)  Personally, I wish the steak had a slightly deeper flavor but I think this might be more of a personal preference.  The bacon was cut very thick and just delicious. The hash browns were a disappointment though. they were cold and dry, almost like hashbrowns left over at a local deli following the morning rush.

3.0,8/13/2015,"Really wanted to love this place, but it fell short of my expectations. Short review: great service, beautiful restaurant, but the steak entree was disappointing. (Would be less of an issue if this weren't a steakhouse...)Came here for restaurant week during lunch. The restaurant was relatively empty so we enjoyed a great table and privacy. The meal started off great. The bread basket here is amazing (so many types of bread)! And, the dry-aged meatball burger sliders were amazing. So flavorful and juicy. If this were an indication of the rest of the meal this restaurant could have easily gotten at least 4-5 stars from me. However, the entree was sorely disappointing. We ordered the filet mignon brochette with chimichurri. To quote my friend: ""this is the hardest thing I've chewed on in awhile."" The steak was incredibly hard to chew so I just ended up eating the copious amount of vegetables and salad that came with the dish. Did I order a steak or a salad? Not quite sure of the answer myself. The dessert was good, but standard. I probably could have purchased a cheesecake from the store and enjoyed it just as much. I have to say 5 stars for service and interior though. Our servers were super friendly and the restaurant was beautifully decorated. You know a restaurant is classy when they offer hand towels in the bathroom instead of paper towels.

As you walk into the restaurant, you'll notice the meat room on the side, where you can see all the dry aged meat hanging, you'll literally droll walking up to get seated.The service here is nothing but fantastic. We were seated immediately and our waiter came and helped us with any questions we had. Shortly after ordering our food, I realized that I wanted to substitute my appetizer for something else and our waiter was able to assist us with it without much problem, which i greatly appreciated. Appetizers: My girlfriend ordered the meatball sliders and I ordered the oyster platter. Both were delicious and highly recommended. Oysters were very fresh and you can taste that as soon as it goes down your throat.Entrees: This is where I was slightly disappointed. My girlfriend ordered the beef ribs while I ordered the filet mignon. The portion of the filet mignon was quite generous, three large pieces sitting on top of a pile of arugula salad. The arugula was quite strong in flavor and definitely overpowered the taste of the steak. My girlfriend's beef rib felt a little on the saltier side and this was not something we expected from Gallaghers Steakhouse after the number of great reviews. Dessert: We had the cheesecake and the sorbet, both which were delicious and have no complaints.Wine: There was a limited selection when it came to ordering wine by the glass, but I had the Charles Krug 2012, and my girlfriend ordered the Malbec. Both solid wine choices, though I would have liked to see the wine by the glass menu expanded.Though the appetizers and dessert were great, the main course is really the entrees, which this review is based of. Perhaps things were done a little differently for restaurant week, but I will come back again to give them another try without ordering from the RW menu.As some has mentioned, service did slightly deteriorate towards the end as the restaurant filled up.

2.0,7/28/2015,"The service here started off great, then it really fell off, as the restaurant for busy during the lunch service. However, despite that I'd have given them three stars if the food was above par. Everything was alright, but the the dessert here was the superstar which is not what I go to a steakhouse for. Came here during restaurant week for a lunch with work people. We didn't order off the restaurant week menu, but wanted a sampling of everything they had to offer. A few people got the sliders from the restaurant week appetizer, I order the lobster bisque, and someone else got the tomatoes and onions with the sauce. The tomatoes and onions were sent back (probably because this wasn't what she intended to order) and the waiter handled it awkwardly. The lobster bisque was below average. The lobster was overcooked and chewy. The bisque was so-so. For the entrée I ordered the steak salad. The steak was cooked well, nothing exceptional about it. The salad however was overdressed. The vinaigrette was very powerful and it really overtook the taste of the other salad ingredients. Would have been a tastier salad if they were more sparing with the dressing. The desserts we ordered however were AMAZING, but no one goes to a place for lunch just for the dessert! So despite having a killer blueberry upside down cake, amazing key lime pie, and a delicious cheesecake. The entrees that everyone in my party ordered were unexceptional and a little subpar. So I'd give them two stars. I probably would not return here, if I want to go to a steakhouse I will stick to Del Frisco's!The bread basket that came to start the meal was ok. I didn't like the dark bread. I thought it was a nice Scandinavian style rye, but instead it was sweet. Not a fan! The multi-grain was ok. Nothing exceptional. The service at first was great, then as the lunch rush began pouring it, they forgot about us in the corner. Our water glasses were empty for over ten minutes, and we kept waiting and waiting to bring this to someone's attention, but no one even looked our way. The check took forever to come and we just generally had an unintentional 2.5 hour lunch that could have been over in 1.5 if service didn't add so much wait time.

The only thing that could satisfy me is mash potato, it is so creamy, and its taste is perfect, but it is too much, a side order can feed 2-3 people. The bake clams was so disappointed. I'm not sure if the clams were fresh, because the clams were tasteless and I only tasted the sauce.

4.0,6/22/2015,"The first thing that struck me about this place is that they don't rush you. You would not think of that at all, given that NYC is hyper.... Great environment and the food is delicious and the service is great BUT WATCH OUT when drinking any liquid there (water or cocktail)... Because you don't wanna have your lips cut or hurt yourself by the edge of a glass while drinking. We were three at a table: the edge of my martini glass was chipped, the glass of the friend next to me was also chipped and it was sharp, my other friend who was having water, has his glass chipped as well.

Add to that our bartender Leo was amazing. Chatted with us and made sure we were having a good time but also gave us our space to enjoy dinner and each other.

5.0,6/10/2015,I make it a point to order steak only at a steakhouse.  And if a restaurant specializes in steak it better be great. Gallagher's was not a disappointment.  In a city where all steaks are compared to those served at Peter Lugers this restaurant offers some stiff competition. Porterhouse for 3 was more than enough for 4. Started with a wedge salad. As I've said before if a restaurant has wedge salad on the menu I'm ordering it.  Back to the steak. Temperature was perfect. Aged beef is just a cut above the rest. Order any sides you like.... All good ( make sure one of the sides is hash browns).  Tuesday night and the place was packed and with good reason.

I used to come here often before they refurbished, but this was my first visit back in over three years and it was worth the wait.  The 14oz filet was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and the shrimp cocktail was prepared perfectly.  Great presentation and delicious.  Most of all, the atmosphere is whhat did it for me,  Old school, yet modern, with great drinks poured by Matthew the bartender.

The room was terrific, the menu extensive, the meal was exceptional and there was a great buzz throughout. Service was professional and seamless. So why not 5 Yelp stars? Because it is a steakhouse and is competing in a league with New York's best.

4.0,5/5/2015,"Passed by this place looking for dinner after watching Book of Mormon. The meat locker where they dry age their meat caught our eye and we decided to try it out since we were in the mood for steak. They seated us quickly so I guess it wasn't that busy on a Sunday night. I ordered the rib steak and my girlfriend ordered the filet. I also ordered the salmon tartare but they mixed it up and I ended up with the steak tartare instead. The food was good and well executed. Despite the mix up, the steak tartare was good. The portion size was decent and the steaks looked bigger than I had thought. The flavor was good but not the best steak ever. As for the service, while it seemed the wait staff was attentive they did mix up my order and also took forever to bring us the check.

5.0,4/20/2015,"During our stay in NYC, we literally had or hotel next door to this place. We walked past it a few times, and have been admiring the display of dry-aged beef a few times. That's a place we need to visit!However, it took until our last night to actually go there. Quickly made a reservation online, and when the time was there, we went. Coats were being put away for us and we were quickly seated in a corner of the place. The restaurant doesn't look big from the outside, but once it, you'll see the difference. I think it will easily host 100+ guests.The atmosphere is really nice, the interior seems to look from the days of the prohibition, although in very good shape! There goes actually a rumor that this is a place where you were able to get alcohol during the prohibition. If that's true... Anyhow, if you go now, there is no problem getting alcohol. A nicely done gin-tonic is a good start and while enjoying that I was browsing the wine menu. Some very good and delicate wines are there, and some hidden gems with decent pricing can be found too.Now for the food, we ordered some starters, a French onion soup and some salad. The onion soup was really good, very hot due to the cheese crust on top. The tomatoes in the salad were huge! The starters were already quite a bit, so take care with what you order.As side, they put you some bread on the table, and for me, the gingerbread-like bread was just heavenly. Spread a thin layer of butter and that's all you need - well, expect for steak of course!As a main, obviously we went for steak. This place obviously knows how to cook  a steak to perfection, and ordering medium or rare, really gives you a medium or rare steak. The meat was very tender, pinky on the inside, and dark but not burned on the outside. Still warm in the middle. I tend to eat my steak first when it arrives, without taking too much care of the sides, which I did here. Well, after taking a photo of it for you guys of course.We were really satisfied with the started and the main, that we didn't take any dessert anymore.A special note on the staff: they are very knowledgeable and friendly. It's not your standard restaurant crew, it's a team of seasoned professionals serving you, which is a nice change to the generally very junior waiters you see in a lot of restaurants.

4.0,4/7/2015,"Our hotel was next door to Gallagher's and our first night in town we walked by the big window of aging meat in amazement. ""We should check it out"" I said after I did my Yelp due diligence and saw that it had some pretty solid reviews. So when Saturday lunch time rolled around we decided to pop in.This place is the quintessential old school steak joint. It's not modern, there's nothing flashy, but that's a good thing. In a town like NYC where trends come and go so quickly something that's so old school and dependable was a bit of a breath of fresh air. The menu looked fantastic from top to bottom but what intrigued us the most was the prix fixe lunch, 3 courses for $25, a veritable steal when it came to Manhattan prices. The internet tells me that this was a Restaurant Week menu but it also tells me that RW was 2/16-3/6 and we were there on 3/21 so they may still have it available. So if you're there for lunch it's worth asking about because it's awesome (but also don't hold it against me if it's no longer offered). The first course? Soup or a salad. Second? Choose from 5 entrees (varying from steak to seafood and chicken). Third? Your choice of dessert (key lime pie, cheesecake, or ice cream/sorbet). I got the caesar salad, the sliced filet mignon (with garlic mushroom butter and mashed potatoes) and the cheesecake. My fella got the soup of the day (minestrone, I believe), the chopped steak (with caramelized onions & mushrooms) and the key lime pie. A surprising amount of food and it was all delicious. My filet was tender and the mushroom sauce was so so good. My fiance's chopped steak was also excellent, juicy and with a good char, but he told me he was a little jealous of mine. I don't blame him. It was awesome. The service is also very old school and by that I mean it was impeccable. From the moment we walked in they treated you with respect. Our waiter was also fantastic. Knowledgeable, helpful, and very outgoing (chatting us up about where we came from, why we were in town, etc). Cocktails are also delicious and, unsurprisingly, classic and unpretentious. I got a French 75 and it was divine. Great wine list as well.Overall a fantastic spot if you're in the area and need a bite, particularly if you're a meat lover and okay with the classics.",3,1,5,Annette J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",3991,1628,6762

This naturally upset me, and I missed part of the show we were seeing to be on the phone with my bank making sure I wasn't the victim of some credit card thief.  Turns out their card machine was broken, and it charged me twice.  After our show, we returned to make sure the charges would be removed.  The manager seriously spoke to me like I was twelve.  He basically said that it happens sometimes and the bank will give me back my money after the weekend.  He definitely didn't treat me like someone who just spent $300 for three people to eat dinner.  He was cocky and rude.  We will visit one of the hundreds of other restaurants in the area for our next girls night out!",1,0,0,Kara D.,"Carlstadt, NJ",2,45,4

But of course, it's staple is their food - classic upscale American with the star being their steaks!We started off with a round of drinks for the table. Everyone decided to go for a classic Old Fashioned cocktail which was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend always says that you know when a bar/restaurant is good if they can prepare a bangin' Old Fashioned - and Gallaghers did not disappoint! In fact, it was one of the best I've had in NYC. If you ever stop by for a drink, make sure you try this!Their appetizer selections were great. We settled for the veal carpaccio, crab cakes, baked clams casino, french onion soup, and fried calamari. All were delicious but the french onion soup and fried calamari stole the spotlight for me. I shared a porterhouse steak, medium, with my boyfriend and the portions were HUGE. The filet was nice and tender - melts in your mouth. The sirloin was a little more chewy and was great with the steak sauce they provided. The only reason why I didn't give Gallaghers 5 stars was because I felt like the steak wasn't juicy enough - I found the sirloin to be a little dry and flavorless without the steak sauce. The sides were decent but not amazing in my opinion. We ordered the sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Lastly, we finished with a slice of their classic NY cheesecake which was great. Just the right amount of sweetness paired with strawberries concluded a great meal.All in all I enjoyed my meal very much, but it's not the best steak I've ever had.

The host confirmed an allergy with us and the waiter to make sure we didn't have any issues. The tables were extremely close to each other which was somewhat uncomfortable when trying to scotch out to use the restroom. Service: The service was great. Our waiter was always asking if we needed anything and giving us some good suggestions. My water glass was kept full (which is a double plus).Food: We split the porterhouse steak for two - medium-rare, oysters, creamed spinach, and hash browns. I wish I had gotten the porterhouse at rare because the edges were cooked well done, so were basically inedible. However, the pieces that were medium-rare/medium were INCREDIBLE. So juicy and tasty. The oysters were also very good - parmesan cheese was on it. I normally do not like oysters or any shell fish for that matter, but I enjoyed these. The hash browns were nothing special, but they were good. The creamed spinach was also nothing special (compared to other steak houses) but I always love creamed spinach .Bathroom: In the women's room there is a woman who monitors the bathroom to make sure everything is clean. She was extremely nice and the bathroom was completely spotless.Drinks: For drink, I had a honey/vodka cocktail and it was not too potent and tasted very good!

3.0,3/1/2015,"Once you enter the restaurant through the revolving doors on the right side, you are able to see their showcasing of the meat locker where they age their steak.  The decor looked old school but classy.  Had the 10 oz filet mignon with bone marrow crust and the veal porterhouse with mash potatoes and creamed spinach sides.  The filet mignon was delicious.  Was juicy and a perfect medium. The bone marrow was a little on the salty side and was not really a fan of.  The veal porterhouse was a little disappointing. Probably should have chosen one of their steak instead. It didn't really taste anything special. Kind of just tasted like a regular pork chop but thicker.  The sides were just ok.  For dessert we shared a banana split.  It was pretty big and probably better for sharing since it had 3 scoops of ice cream.  We tried all 3 flavors they had, which was vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate.Service was good.  Food came out fairly quickly.  Need to come back to try their other cuts of steaks.",1,0,0,Jason L.,"Brooklyn, NY",105,228,744

Old pictures on the walls, dark woods and carpeting, it feels very clubby in here. I order their classic drink, the 52nd St Old Fashion. Amazing flavors, it's something you must try if you're visiting NYC.Walking by the window and seeing these dry aged steak, my tongue is always hanging out and drooling.

It looked like he was waiting the entire side of the restaurant, and trust me were the only ones with slow service. Tables around us were all a bit perplexed as to where their waiter had gone off too. So that was a bit disappointing. I ordered my steak well done and I received it medium I'd say, a bit surprised especially that this is a ""steakhouse"". Other than that the rest of the food was pretty good. Then comes the price which is expected, but it just wasn't worth it. At such a price point I expect near perfect service and steak cooked the way I desired it.

The spinach was fine, though not up to the version at St. Anselm. The potatoes were very good. Only one thing really fell down, and unfortunately it was the most important thing. The steak was overcooked. Not by a lot, but enough that it was certainly more medium than medium rare. It was a small enough difference that I didn't complain, but it was still a bit of a bummer, as it was priced to perfection. My friend's sirloin was also more of a medium.

2.0,11/23/2014,"My wife and I love steak and prime rib. We decided to try out Gallagher's this past Saturday, before the theater.  There were two reasons: rated in a list of the top 10 in NY and the owner, Dean Poll, has a good track record.  Our reservation was taken without problem, and we asked if they had prime rib...'yes and we should reserve it since they may run out'.  So, one end cut and one mid cut---both on the bone!  We arrived for our 6:00 reservation and they seated us immediately. Everything about this place was nice, especially the wait staff.  I immediately told our waiter that we had reserved the prime ribs.  The jumbo shrimp were in fact JUMBO and great.  Now things start to go downhill. Our prime ribs come out.  My wife's had no bone and looked as though it should have been tossed to the side (maybe it was!). I immediately told the waiter of the problem and they took it away and brought out a new piece in a reasonable time.  This was fine.  My prime rib was on the bone and there seemed to be extra on the plate.  It was not an end cut. I said nothing as more would have been counterproductive at this time.  The hash browns were 'brown' on top and plain cooked potatoes underneath the seared top.  The meat, while good quality, was very fatty and just ok. No seasoning? No natural juice? No taste. I really don't know, but it did not measure up.  Good cheesecake. While paying I collared the Maitre D and told him about the prime ribs. He asked my name and then told me that he personally reserved my order. He took care of some other diners and returned 'complaining' to some other staff and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience. He said that he was checking into what happened.  We paid and left.  We were hoping to find a great place for something that we love, but were not only disappointed with the meal but how it was 'not handled'.  Even after we left, they could have contacted us if they had more to say.  So the lesson here (always the same) is to immediately bring your problem(s) to the staff and give them an opportunity to make things right.",0,0,0,Jon K.,"Great Neck, NY",0,7,0

We're great.  dinner under the care of Patrick and company was flawless outside of the fried calamari whic seemed more steamed than fried.  The filet mignon and stuffed shrimp were Devine as we're the clams casino.  Glad to see our New Yor staple is alive and well!!!!,0,0,0,K H.,"Milford, CT",0,43,1
3.0,11/21/2014,"Ahhh this dinner bummed me out a little.I was out of the country for the past 2 weeks and hadn't eaten much meat, so was craving a good steak.I haven't been to a steakhouse in awhile either so spent a fair amount of time on the interwebz and yelp trying to find the perfect spot and after much research decided on Gallaghers due to the reviews and it's near proximity to my office (cuz its brick outside and I'm not trekking to Peter Lugers when my nips could cut glass, 'nah mean?). But after that research and looking at the pics, I was like a lil kid at xmas about to get his first video gaming system. OH EXCITED ANTICIPATIONNNN!The meat locker they have when you walk in is basically food porn. Ahhh so much meat... My date thought it kind of gross, but as a carnivore, that shi*t just wets the appetite visually.Tuna Poke - not what it sounds like you perv. Hawaiian dish similar to tuna tartar. Really good. Light, nice flavors, radish balanced things out nicely with a lil spicy sauce to add some kick. Some whole peppercorns in it that threw me off a little, would have preferred a nice even spread of it ground up, but overall a tasty dish and one I would definitely eat again particularly as it's not the same boring sesame and soy sauce a lot of places do.For the main I had the Rib Eye - here's where this restaurant lost major points. It's a steakhouse right? 50% is the right meat/ seasoning, the other 50% is getting it cooked right. Flavor was great. It's bone in, aged, good marbling, etc. I ordered medium rare, as ordering it anything else is just nonsensical IMO and even criminal. First time came out medium, immediately I'm sad.  My date is looking at me funny and questions the puppy dog look. The sear on the thing was great too, but ahhh a steakhouse should be pro at the medium rare! Now somewhere else depending on my mood, I'd just eat it and get on with my night, however if I'm dropping $50 bones on a piece of meat, I want it cooked right. Waiter was super accommodating in bringing it back and they refilled my half eaten plate of fries for me free of charge which was a nice touch (then again I didn't really think much of the fries lol so it would have been nicer if they had just thrown in another side on the house, particularly as they have a lot of sides to try, but I appreciated the gesture). So rookie mistake, instead of making it an actual medium rare, they over compensated and gave me something more towards the rare side, but I'd much rather eat under than over cooked. What I assume is the manager stopped by to inquire if I this one was cooked better to my liking and I really didn't want to be that dick that sends his food back twice (plus at this point I'm pretty hungry and don't want to have to wait again) so I just say yeah and chow down. Eventually I start to fill up and its getting a little rarer in the middle so I take it to go so I can reheat it later.  Date had the filet and the sauteed mushrooms (thanks for ordering a $12 side which you ate maybe 1/8th of babe =p specially as I don't eat shrooms of the non magical variety). She commented that her shrooms were delish but that her filet was just a touch overdone as well.  I had a bite of the filet and it was pretty tasty and very tender, but as she said, just a skosh over. Didn't have room for dessert, but the creme brulee the table next to me got looked quite appetizing.Overall:Service was great, flavors were great, place had the right kind of steakhouse ambiance, but the star of the night was a lil bit of a let down. Not sure if I'd go back even tho I had originally planned to head back and try the prime rib if I enjoyed my dinner, but maybe I was just unlucky?Oh, & one last plus - their version of the old fashioned was damn good too.",1,1,3,Jonathan L.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",106,155,48

4.0,10/13/2014,"The service from maître d'hôtel through waitstaff to busboy was phenomenal: very attentive without being intrusive and the maître d'hôtel accommodated seating requests within reason and with a great deal of grace.  The last time I experienced service this good was at the likes of Daniel Boulud/Jean-George's/Le Bernadin except that here, it's sans jackets and ties and so much more comfortable.  I had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (nice and chunky with a great creamy mix that was nicely cooked through with a nice crust without being dried out), and the Sirloin with shared side orders of sautéed onions (nothing spectacular) and their garlic corn special (sweet, crunchy without being overwhelmed by the garlic and delicious).  My Sirloin steak was okay but a little mushy.  Maybe it was overaged?  I like my meats to be still springy (not mushy) yet moist and not dried out and their meats satisfied most of my criterion aside from the slightly mushy quality.  The doneness (medium rare) was perfectly on the money, however.  My buddy's description of his dishes are reproduced practically verbatim here (the only changes were for accented characters which didn't come across):""The soup had a rich body and well balanced in acidity. Bread was absorbent and retained its structure.  It was flavorful but not overpowering, preparing you for the entrée. What a decent french onion should be.The ribeye was a pleasure. It was evenly cut and had the perfect thickness (~1.25 inches post cooking).  While I personally prefer a thicker slice. A heftier cut increasedthe difficulty of proper preparation. The steak I had was a near center cut.  Taste and texture did not strongly signify dry aging.  The fibers were distinct, tender but not mushy.  Crust was well formed and no burns. This encourages me to try one of their specialty bone marrow or blue cheese crust in the future.I was pleasantly surprised by the inhouse steak sauce which I only tried near the end of the meal. It had a complex blend of flavors with a hint of spiciness. It would have made a great addition to the leftovers.""We were rather disappointed that the Roast Prime Rib had sold out but they told us we had to reserve if we wanted it in future as it sometimes is so popular (even on a weekday evening) that it sells out by 5:30pm daily!  If nothing else, we're both coming back, hopefully when we get a chance to try their Roast Prime Rib or even sooner because, if nothing else, we know we're going to get fantastic service (even though we weren't regulars but I sure aim to become one)!  The waitstaff was worth every penny of the tip and then some (and I don't say this lightly about any establishment).  If their Roast Prime Rib is as good as or better than the rest of their steaks, I think I've found my replacement for Ben Benson's (which closed its doors forever in 2013).",2,1,0,Tanster M.,"New York, NY",12,66,99

These guys are serious about dry aged beef. In fact, so serious that they showcase the cuts of aging meat in their locker to anyone that happens along the restaurant on West 52nd. The environs are a classy blend of white linen clad tables and hundreds of photos taken of the patrons over the years. I could tell at once that this is my kind of place! The service is equally as impressive, on both visits I enjoyed top tier waitpersons that knew the menu inside out. As a starter, I highly suggest the Spicy Tuna Poke which is a simple but delicious amalgamation of chili aioli, radish, lime served in a gorgeous plated stack. A splendid start, really. The French Onion Soup is another stand out featuring a deep onion & beef broth and topped with a three cheese crouton. I rather enjoyed their Caesar as well, Romaine lettuce is tossed along with garlic croutons and Grana Padano.As for the main, I went with the Bone-In Sirloin which came in at a very reasonable $42.00 (in Manhattan standards) and was perfectly prepared; grilled over hickory logs. The 21+ day aging process really breaks down the connective tissues in the meat and this steak was soft, supple and absolutely delicious with a buttery aftertaste. My company elected the 10 ounce portion of the Filet Mignon and was just as impressed. We shared an order of the mashed potatoes, which in retrospect was entirely too much food but go big or go home. I ordered a post aperitif cocktail; gin & tonic which was very stiff.

2.0,7/30/2014,"We decided to visit Gallagher's while we were visiting New York on vacation. The food here was very good but our server, John, was not so much. The steak is very flavorful and juicy, the sides are very tasty, but the experience was soured by the rude nature of our server.The first time my medium-rare steak was brought out, it was overcooked to the point that it was actually well-done. Not usually an issue, but when I brought it to the server's attention he made me cut the steak three different times to prove that it was indeed overcooked. I think that as a customer, I should be given the benefit of the doubt as to whether or not I can tell the difference between medium-rare and well-done. He eventually brought out another steak that was prepared properly and it was great. But throughout the night he seemed very short and unfriendly. It made the whole experience a bit uncomfortable for us. The odd thing was that he acted very differently to another party that was near us. With them, he wore a smile and was talkative. He even served their sides for them. Don't get me wrong we're not some prima donnas who need others to serve us our side dishes, but I think a waiter's service should be consistent among his various customers. Now, I don't know if it was our ""touristy"" appearance (we were sightseeing all day in the hot New York weather), but my family did feel a little discriminated against. Every interaction we had with him lasted about 5 seconds. The dessert menu was dropped off in a hurry and picked up in a hurry. Same goes with the check.

I'm now 47.  I live on the upper east side of nyc, so I've been to many many restaurants here.  Lots has changed except for the meat locker which will be forever embedded in my mind. We started off with the tuna poke which happened to be amazing!!! But be warned, it has quite a bite to it!! Nevertheless, a fantastic appetizer! The goat cheese, beets and arugula salad was phenomenal! Perfect group of flavors in your mouth.  The porterhouse was recommended and just cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The creamed spinach is a huge MUST!! Do NOT miss out on that!! The staff, we had randy and francis, what a pair!! It was as if they were inside our heads.  Right on top of everything. There was a feeling of being taken care of and that goes with a professional and seasoned staff. Don't get me wrong, seasoned but still clean and handsome!  To end the perfect dinner, we ordered the sinful banana split and the excessive sorbet. You will not walk away hungry, but you will be back for more!! Deeeeelish!",1,0,1,Leslie H.,"New York, NY",6,5,10
5.0,7/16/2014,"Gallagher's is simply amazing. These guys have been around since 1927, so they certainly know what they are doing. We went there in a Saturday night before a show and everything worked super smoothly. We made a reservation and our table was ready for us, even though it was a saturday and they were starting to get busy.From ambiance to service and food, everything is great here. The place is nice and classic, with tons of cool pics of important people and celebrities that have been there. Their meat locker is also pretty interesting and will get your attention.As for food, from appetizers to dessert everything was really tasteful and well prepared. To start we tried some oysters and stake tartare. For the main course I had the small filet mignon and sautéed spinach, both were delicious, cooked to perfection. For dessert we tried the pistachio soufflé, which was superb. This is a great spot for meat lovers that like the classic feel of a traditional steakhouse.

4.0,5/4/2014,"One of my best friends and I have a standing ""Bros' Night"" wherein large quantities of meat and scotch are consumed whilst watching a lot of sports together. Last weekend, we went to Gallaghers for dinner before catching the OKC/MEM game. I had an excellent Manhattan to start, we ordered a surprisingly pleasant Pinot Noir, and finished off with some Macallan's neat. Dinner consisted of the following:Burrata & Coal-Fired Peppers - This was delicious but let's be honest, if you're screwing up burrata, you should get out of the restaurant business.Porterhouse for two - Perfectly medium rare. Unlike many of the fancy steaks in this town, the meat was not drowned in butter. Still under debate whether this method is a good or bad thing. But the steak in and of itself was delicious.Creamed Spinach - Solid. Some of the better creamed spinach I've had.Sautéed Mushrooms - In retrospect, why did we spend $12 on mushrooms? I don't know. They were fine but I would've rather had another cocktail for that price.Mashed Potatoes - Awesome. We actually added this to our order as our steak was arriving because the table next to us got it and it looked incredible. We were not disappointed.Bananas Fosters Pie - Good not great.Overall, we had a really nice meal. The ambiance is revitalized classic steakhouse. The service was great.

2.0,4/30/2014,"I went to Gallaghers this week for the first time in over four years.  I noticed that there was something different about the look.  The bartender said it had closed for renovation and just opened recently.  He gave me the impression that the change was not all that radical.  However, I noticed a difference, a bad one.  The service was friendly and attentive.  However, the food was terrible.  My Caesar salad was not fresh.  The lettuce leaves were limp and tasteless.  The filet mignon I ordered was also rather tasteless.  I am a terrible cook, but even I could do better than their chef.  The famous Gallaghers chips, the signature snack for decades, were cold and tasteless.  One could get better chips in any grocery store.Also, there was something a little off about the newly renovated space.  The old pictures of celebrities do not work well with the slick decor, modern lighting and white table cloths.  It looked like the new owners did not make the leap into the new and landed in a mud puddle of design confusion.  They did not renovate and successfully maintain the old tradition.  They also did not make a successful jump into the future.  I think I will skip this clumsy hybrid and go somewhere else.",4,3,2,Liz S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0

3.0,4/24/2014,"Last night we had a disappointing dinner at Gallagher's to celebrate my husband's birthday. It wasn't a travesty, but there was room for a ton of improvement, mostly on the service side.The hostess was a bit clueless. The whole front desk area was a mess- they really needed an experienced person behind the hostess stand. We noticed a group of about 20 Germans standing near the bar, confused, while someone rushed around to set up a table for them. When it came time to seat us, the hostess seemed perplexed as to why I was there.I later heard the bartenders making cracks about the Germans being good drinkers but bad tippers. Tacky.Our main waiter was a bit sloppy, but his assistant server (Mario?) was on point. When I asked if they had any specials, he mentioned they had a snapper special, but didn't know any details about it. He had to ask Mario for more information, and told me he missed the staff meeting earlier in the day. Ok. I ordered it, and while it was prepared correctly, it came smothered in a tomato-olive tapenade, which he failed to mention (I hate olives). He also told me he doesn't know what to say about fish, since he's here to sell steak. Way to turn off the non-meat eater paying the bill.We ordered half a dozen East Coast oysters, which were spectacular. Salty and fresh from the sea. Good enough to order a second round! Our salads came after the oysters, and mine was incorrect (I asked for no cheese, but of course it had cheese, since the server didn't write down our order). They were fine, nothing special. Our entrees were served seconds after our salad plates were cleared, and the server said, ""sorry, I couldn't hold your entrees any longer since you ordered the second round of oysters."" Dude, don't blame me for jacking up the bill! And since when do entrees get fired when the oysters come out? Weird.The sauteed spinach and hash browns were tasty, the snapper was pretty good, and my husband's $52 ribeye was overcooked. A side note, I think the staff's wine knowledge could use some work. We drank two bottles of beautiful Stags' Leap Petite Sirah. I saw the table directly across from us had Stags' Leap Cab, the waiter helping the table next to me recommended only the Stags' Leap Cab, and when it was time to order a second bottle of wine, our server suggested the Stags' Leap Cab. Hey, it's a good wine, I just found it odd that a high end restaurant is stuck on one wine.When it was time to leave, we stood at the hostess station for quite awhile, waiting for someone to come over so we could collect our coats. Finally, what looked like a manager came over, texting on his cell, and took our tickets. No ""how was your dinner,"" just took the tickets. Hrmph.Wouldn't return. My steak-loving husband would rather eat at Quality Meats or Peter Luger any day. Bill was about $400 for two.",1,0,0,Lisako V.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,105,1

5.0,2/20/2014,"Gallaghers overall score: 95 Gallaghers had recently closed down, was repurchased, renovated, and now has reopened, returning a once-considered-to-be NYC staple in the steakhouse world to its former glory. It had fallen on ill times for a while before it closed. I went a few years ago and was disappointed (if you are curious, the old, defunct review is HERE). But now, with a new chef, decor upgrades, etc - it is BACK with a vengeance. I was totally blown away by the improvements they made, so I figured I would write an entirely new entry for the joint. Out with the old, in with the new. Flavor: 9 We tried the rib eye and the marrow crusted filet. Both were incredible. I hate to say it, but I think the filet packed more of a punch than the rib eye in terms of flavor; probably because of the smashed, roasted garlic that was spread on top, and the amazing quality of the fat that was introduced back into the meat via the marrow. The rib eye was perfectly cooked, with a great sear on the outside that locked in the juicy pinkness inside. I found it to be just a hair under seasoned though, so decided to hold back on giving full points on flavor. Check out the pics. As you can see, the filet came with a little side of roasted marrow as well, and that was topped with a crunchy bread crumb crust to give it texture. Fantastic.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 10 Everything here is top notch quality. I mean, fuck, you can see it right in the window as it ages. They offer a porterhouse, two versions of a strip, a rib eye, a prime rib, a chopped steak, and several sizes and varieties of filet. Portion Size & Plating: 10 Portions are excellent. The filet is basically 10oz or 14oz, which is pretty good for the vagina cut. The rib eye was around 20oz, probably more, if I had to guess. Side items and apps were good sizes too, and not as overpriced as one might expect from a prime theater district location. Plating was impressive; simple yet artful and elegant. Check out the crudo and carpaccio apps below. Gorgeous. Price: 8 Obviously the cost is a bit inflated because of the location; I don't even want to know what this place pays out in rent every month. You get a great meal for the money though, so it's worth the splurge. Here's the bill - see for yourself:Bar: 10 This is a bar of legendary status. It's been around since the late 20′s. If you haven't been there, please do yourself a favor and go immediately. They mix a fine martini, and the bartender Leo is awesome: a true master of mixing. I even tried an old fashioned from the cocktail menu and it was done incredibly.Specials and Other Meats: 9 They didn't read any specials to us, but everything is special here. I am really impressed with the turn-around this place made. Bravo. As for other meats, they offer veal, lamb, and chicken. They pulled the pork item they used to serve (no big deal), but they do offer some alternative beef cuts like the chopped steak (glorified burger) and the prime rib (rib eye for women). And I mentioned above the several different types of filet you can order, but I will list them here for you: blue cheese crust, marrow crust, pepper/Makers Mark crust, mushroom garlic butter, sweet chili rubbed, porcini and coffee rubbed, and cajun rubbed. Apps, Sides & Desserts: 10 We tried a few items: the hamachi crudo, the veal carpaccio, and the french onion soup, to start. The hamachi was crisp, clean and really nicely plated. The yuzu jalapeno dressing really punched it up. The veal carpaccio was so light and delicate. It was amazing. I didn't care much for the beets, but hey, I loved it otherwise. The french onion soup was nicely executed. It wasn't too heavy or overly salty, yet it still packed great flavor.Dessert and after dinner drinks came to us on the house, which was just incredible. We had a sampling. We had the key lime pie, which was my favorite of the bunch, the banana cream pie (which came with a brulee'd banana), and the chocolate cake. They look every bit as good as they tasted. And for a guy like me who generally isn't into sweets as much as others, they were not overly sweet - they were just right.Seafood Selection: 9There's a good amount to choose from all over the menu. I like the nod to the man's seafood steak: the swordfish, steak of the sea. Well played. We had a great seat near the open concept kitchen as well, so we got to drool over the shellfish display: Service: 10 Impeccable. What an amazing group of people. Everyone. Hostesses, management, wait staff, kitchen team - all great people. Just to give a tribute, Nick & Caesar felt like family, had really great menu recommendations for us, and were attentive and genuinely nice guys. Nick is truly a work horse. The guy commutes well over an hour to get there, and I was happy to know he's been serving guests at Gallaghers for 25 years. Awesome. The managers Charlie and James really went...review cut for length, because yelp BLOWS",10,4,4,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300
