1.0,4/29/2019,"What a disappointment this previously good restaurant is now. The menu has changed. We asked and were told the menu changed a month ago. The menu now features inferior dishes at jacked up prices. Considering that the restaurant was half empty, the service was appalling. We won't be back and would be surprised to see  this restaurant survive the summer. A total ripoff. Crappy overpriced food. Avoid.",0,0,0,Alma H.,"New York, NY",0,26,0
5.0,4/18/2019,"Delicious food, creative and mouth watering entrees and deserts, elegant yet not stuffy atmosphere, and the hostess and owner Georgette is the most classy, gracious professional in the industry.  A fabulous New York City dining experience.

5.0,2/18/2019,"Everything was perfect from the moment we checked our coats to our getting them back. The service was impeccable, everybody was kind to us, and the food (I always get the orange duck) was succulent. Hands down the best orange duck in NYC. I've been coming here for a few years now, and I must say whatever they did, the duck is even better than before! More of it, juicier. I also liked that I had a respectful yet opinionated sommelier! She took my Bourgogne order, but also suggested a Bordeaux that turned out to be a very good choice for the duck. Let alone the fact that I was offered a very, very generous pour that lasted me the whole meal, our entire experience was so perfect that it felt like one you read about but never actually live it. We did at Georgette and we hope you do too. We'll be going back for more!",0,0,0,David A.,"New York, NY",34,15,6
3.0,2/3/2019,"Nice location. Service was okay but we waited forever for our brunch. I had Les Jaunes, essentially eggs Benedict. The eggs and only -fair hollandaise sauce were barely warm. The salad I had beforehand was excellent, however. The Bloody Mary was also good. Frankly, the meal was not worth what we paid which was about $50. per person.",0,0,0,Ann J.,"Yarmouth, ME",0,1,0
3.0,1/17/2019,"Charming quaint French restaurant with good food and unobtrusive good service . We met friends when we came into the city and had a lovely lunch. They come here often and I can see why.We had reservations for lunch on a Monday and were seated immediately. Service was prompt and we enjoyed wonderful  fresh bread while we were deciding on our meal.  We decided on the Poulet Frites Lunch  ( Roasted 1/2 chicken Jus Provencal, Pommes Frites and mixed green salad with Mustard Vinaigrette. $29.00) and the G Salad Lunch ( Roasted Chicken, Mesclun, Frise, Asian Pear, Lardons Candied Walnuts, Blue Cheese and Mustard Vinaigrette $28.00).The chicken was delicious - cooked perfectly with gravy, and the salad was fresh with the tasty Mustard Vinaigrette. The fries were a bit too thin and crisp for me but everyone else seemed to enjoy them. The service was great about keeping our glasses filled and bringing more bread as needed.Yes at the end of the day it is just ""Rotisserie Chicken"", but it was tasty and not out of whack  in it's price point for a NY lunch.",0,0,0,Wendy S.,"Attleboro, MA",54,345,260
1.0,1/13/2019,I've eaten in the restaurant several times and loved it. But I really don't think they can handle the recent expansion to seamless. Our order was 40 min late (we live 1block away). Chicken was fine (but cold) - everything else was a disaster. Sides were hugely over cooked and cold. Starters were fine but felt shop bought and repackaged. Salad - well  check out the pic.So disappointed. Really like this place but they cannot expect to charge restaurant prices for this.,0,0,0,Phil R.,"Manhattan, NY",12,4,1
3.0,12/28/2018,"Terribly disappointing rotisserie chicken - if your namesake menu item is not good, then perhaps time to rename the restaurant. The chicken was incredibly dry and not very flavorful. The burrata appetizer was good and I really enjoyed the crispy texture of the topping that was added to it. The service was really bizarre. Woman at the front was nice and took our coats. Then we had a multitude of different people that stopped by our table throughout the meal. Just was very inconsistent - too many different people, I couldn't tell who exactly was our waiter. Couldn't tell if our waiter was nervous or aloof. Didn't get a friendly vibe from the waitstaff. Had to flag someone down to get our bill and the restaurant wasn't crowded because we came in early on a rainy Sunday evening.",2,0,3,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",992,902,770

5.0,11/3/2018,"You cannot beat the location - across from Barneys,  this quaint and very old world Parisian setting for this over the top rotisserie. I enjoyed the lunch special of half a chicken with French fries, a veggie and a salad.  The chicken was certainly delicious, the fries are hand cut and were crispy, salad with light vinaigrette. I am glad I didnt pay attention to the bad reviews. I loved it! I was on vacation; however the restaurant was filled with business folks on their lunches, a passionate  French couple having a long lunch were to my right. The waiter was spot on, but not overly in our face. We enjoyed a glass a of rose,  and espresso at the end.

4.0,7/28/2018,"My friend and I enjoyed dinner here during Summer Restaurant Week 2018.  If you're in a hurry & can't read my entire review--Yes, I'd recommend Rotisserie Georgette! Go! Enjoy!   Call & make a reservation. I have posted 13 PHOTOS -please see them. Note:  We also ordered from the regular menu as well as the special 2018 Summer Restaurant Week Menu.  The rotisserie chicken was delicious.  It was juicy & flavorful; I'd recommend it for sure.  I don't think the photos here on Yelp, or anywhere, do it justice. The portions are generous & you will feel satisfied.  There are other entree options & they all looked delicious.  The table next to us had ribs and French fries that looked fantastic! These were not on the Restaurant week menu, but available from the regular menu, which is on your table. Back to our meal--Appetizer --my friend had the Salad, very good.  I chose the chilled corn soup for my appetizer & I was very impressed with the wonderful flavor pairings and the texture of the dollop of chopped avocado in the center--see my photo. The chilled corn soup had the lime --I'll call it a sauce--as a lovely circle or ring of wonderful flavor on the top of the chilled soup.  The dollop of finely chopped avocado was placed in the center.  All I can tell you is I WAS TOTALLY ENJOYING THE FLAVORS. My tastebuds were loving this.  It may sound simple, but the combination of the slightly sweet, smooth, chilled corn soup, with the wonderful, perfect lime flavor was delightful--I LOVED THIS!!!  And then the smooth, creamy, diced  avocado --yet, just the right amount of flavor & texture from the finely chopped avocado ---well, I thought this chilled soup was PERFECTION!! I loved the deliciousness & the flavorful creativity of this smooth chilled soup & it's presentation was lovely & fun.  I applaud the creator of this fabulous appetizer.  (Emoji applause goes here, with a STANDING OVATION!! Yes, I loved the chilled corn soup that much!) My sincere compliments to the creator & chef of this soup! The bread & butter on the table was fresh & yummy good.  I don't know why, but it was a little comical that my bread dish seemed to keep disappearing...however, the 3rd one did stay on the table...yes, I said 3.   Obviously, the very easy fix for this is to simply ask before removing a plate from the table.  And keep in mind, just because one person says you can take away their bread plate does not mean that every bread plate should be removed --just ask each person.  After all, you are serving lovely, fresh bread...We also enjoyed the carrots side dish (not included in restaurant week menu) And, we ordered the Chilled Asparagus side dish from the regular menu.  Both sides were delicious.  Carrots, sort of a candied carrot--loved it!  And I enjoyed the asparagus very much, also.And for dessert:  I had the Apricot Clofutti--yum-o!! Delicious!!!  Served warm/hot.  See my photos.  My friend had the yummy, delicious ice cream sandwich.  See photos.My compliments to the entire restaurant .  Food-delicious .  Service--aiming to make your visit as pleasant as possible.  If you haven't decided by now, let me help you: Make a reservation!! Confirm the reservation!!!!  Go! AND RE:  RESERVATIONS-----IF YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR RESERVATION, ESPECIALLY DURING ANY NYC RESTAURANT WEEK, PLEASE HAVE THE COURTESY TO CALL THE RESTAURANT & CANCEL, so that someone else may enjoy.  THANK YOU.  See my photos.",6,0,5,Reva R.,"New York, NY",418,167,2548

The food was excellent and the wait staff was very accommodating - they had great recommendations, and the chef even sent out a plate of asparagus for us to try. Unfortunately, the final act of the evening was horrible. We had a problem with a credit card (blocked due to travel) and the person who brought us back the bill was extraordinarily rude to my mother in law. Again, everything was flawless except this part of the experience, but this part was very upsetting for my mother in law and also for my wife.

There were tables available and we have money to spend on dinner. We were seated in back and very happening area of this establishment. Our server was really sweet took our drink and menu selections and the rest of the evening was great. We chose the half chicken with sauce and Brussel sprouts and roasted potatoes. For dessert coffee and a shot of Jameson whiskey. Our server brought us champagne extra and was so sweet.

Servers and waiters were phenomenal, very attentive and receptive. I had the chicken (after reading all of the raving reviews) and my wife had the mussels. Unfortunately although I thought the food was great, I have to admit that it didnt knock me off my feet, especially for the price. Similarly I thought that the mussel dish was fantastic, but my wife noted that she was yearning for a little bit more variety towards the end of the dish. Perhaps this was a result of the prefixed restaurant week menu; I found myself salivating over a nearby table's ribs (not on my menu). Overall would recommend.

My cup of water was always being filled up and We appreciated how the staff would approach us here and there to ask about how the meal is. We found the chicken super tender and delicious. The stuffed baked potato was super hearty & paired well with the chicken. The pomes frites were the best regular french fries I've had. We also shared the wildMushroom gnocchi. It was super tasty but found it to be lacking mushrooms. We would have loved more mushrooms though! They also provided some sliced bread with the best butter ever. As for dessert, we got the chocolate soufflé which was super decadent! The vanilla icecream and the addition of the truffle complimented the dish so well!

Foie gras is foie gras and always delicious, however, the real attraction at Rotisserie Georgette is the chicken. I thought the chicken was extremely dry and bland. I was honestly shocked that this place is so well known for their ""amazing"" chicken when I quite didn't understand the hype. I also found it extremely overpriced.Even in speaking with friends of mine, they've told me to give RG another shot as they enjoyed it many many times before.

We started with bread and savory ""Madeline's"" which were amazing. Then we got some sort of salmon spread and burrata which were great too. For the main course the chicken is served in silver dishes by the waiters and placed on elevated little stands on the table, I've never seen chicken served so elegantly! The carrots were to die for. Also the broccoli was great. When it came time for desert we got some sort of pastry puff with ice cream which was amazing.Great service, great food, great decor.

We were seated in the back booth near the open kitchen and after receiving our drinks, a woman came up and asked my daughter Audrey if she would like a tour of the kitchen. She was thrilled! We soon realized that this friendly, charismatic lady was Georgette! Not only was the food out of this world, but the experience was extremely special. We loved everything about it! Georgette came back after dinner, took my daughter back to the kitchen and taught her how to make the desserts we ordered. The Madeleines were the best. Rotisserie Georgette is very special. The sauces and vegetables that go along with the rotisseries are delicious and beautiful.

Preferred it that way as it was warm and relaxing, not a ""scene.""  Excellent, attentive service. Compelling décor. Some of the entrée portions too small for the price (ie, the egg dishes), but still delicious and well-crafted. It was an anniversary meal which I noted on Open Table, and without any prodding, the staff added extra comps and touches to the meal which were unexpected, generous and lovely. I have no doubt dinner gets high marks at Georgette. She's done an first-rate job, and her Boulud training and influence are evident in the décor and food, with her own edgy and interesting touch.

4.0,4/30/2017,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for more than a year, but the stars never aligned until now. My wife and I went early on a saturday before the dinner rush. We were greeted and seated immediately by uniformed staff. The level of service was surprising!  It is an upscale restaurant, but shy of ""fine dining"" by reason of the menu, which is fantastic, but not fussy or complicated. Their stock in trade, as their name implies, is rotisserie roasted meat. Their mainstay is their chicken. Be assured, this is no Boston Chicken.We ordered the Poulet Deluxe: a whole rotisserie chicken cut, the breast rubbed under the skin with herbs, mushrooms and swiss chard (although I hesitate to use the word ""stuffed"", as they do on the menu), delivered on a platter and topped with two thick slices of seared foie gras and a side of enriched pan juices. We were served tableside and the service was attentive without being distracting. Our bottle of rose was kept on ice, and our glasses topped off regularly.The chicken itself was, without a doubt, the best version of rotisserie chicken I have ever eaten. The breast was moist, the skin was crisp, the meat was seasoned throughout, and the size of the bird was generous. The jus was incredibly flavorful without being overwhelmingly salty. At $35 per person, this might seem like highway robbery, considering you can pick up a cooked bird at the supermarket for $5 these days. But the quality of the poultry, the care with which it was prepared, the way it was presented and the high quality of service that accompanied it, made it well worth the price. In Manhattan, it could even be considered a steal.And Georgette, herself, stopped by every table to make sure everything was superb. I highly recommend this restaurant.",0,0,0,Robert W.,"New York, NY",1,10,14

The three of us shared a burrata appetizer, which was dressed with nutty pesto; it was accompanied by excellent bread. For dinner, we ate a whole roasted chicken (52, double the price of a half-chicken). The ladies drank prosecco (12, glass) and I tried a dry rye Manhattan (19, Michters, excellent and pricey). We intended to order the Chicken deluxe (36 per person) and we were served the whole roasted chicken. We made up for the misunderstanding with a side of seared foie gras (24). Dessert was profiteroles (3 for 14), and a bottle of Domaine Chanson Givry pinot noir accompanied our meal (68). We plan to return before the Hairy Ape at the Armory.TOTAL: 264TIP: Can be priceyTIP: Crispy sunchoke side dish is similar enough to frites to suggest avoiding both in one mealBONUS: Good serviceBONUS: Pleasant decor",1,1,0,Steve N.,"New York, NY",97,598,24

I loved the mushroom sauce it came with and the herbs rubbed on the skin. For the sides, I particularly recommend the carrots. They were delicious. This was plenty of food for three of us though we did clean our plates. I was very happy that they seated us ahead of our reservation. The service was also extremely good and the place itself is quite nice inside. We even enjoyed the overpriced cocktails.

4.0,1/20/2017,"I split a whole roasted chicken (on the menu for 2) with a friend, and we couldn't finish it. Between the mushroom stuffing, and the foie gras that it came with, it was just a lot of food. And we didn't order anything else! It was very tasty.  And it comes almost immediately. I guess since its the house specialty, they must constantly have chicken on the rotisserie, just waiting to be prepared.  It was also nice that they bring one of those raised serving platters (like you see in Pizza places) to put the plate with the chicken on, so that you have more room at the table.   It is also nice that they have a bathroom up front, as well as in the back of the restaurant. So that the bar patrons (and those sitting more up front) don't have to march through the entire restaurant and potentially bump into people sitting and eating.  I docked them a star for 2 reasons, the noise level is very loud.  And the corkage fee for bringing your own wine is high at $50, per bottle.  Similar places seem to be in the $25 to $35 range, and when you add in the tax and tip, the corkage comes to $65.  They give you very nice wine glasses, but its still high.  I'd love to go back, but only if they reduce the corkage.

2.0,11/23/2016,"For us, -my mother and I-, it is always important to be welcomed warmly, even though my service dog always accompanies me. Often, hosts and hostesses are very friendly until they see my dog. Then they have to reevaluate the situation and mostly they find a good solution. Sometimes their attitude changes completely and when they do not deal professionally with such a situation, I leave the place, because I am convinced that if you cannot welcome service dogs and their owners as you would treat guests without their service animal, the rest of the experience will be ruined. There are enough  other restaurants that will welcome us warmly, so what is the point of wasting your time in a negative environment. The hostess of Rotisserie Georgette was very correct and professional in welcoming us with my service dog. We did need to show her the card that proves that my dog is a service dog, which I find very normal. No problem so far. Once we were seated and ready to relax during our lunch, a man in a suit approached the hostess and after a short chat with her, he came to our table, shook our hands and asked us AGAIN if our dog was a service dog. I overheard the hostess mentioning the word ""service dog"", so I assume she told him my dog was one. I told the general manager, as whom he introduced himself, that we already said to the hostess that my dog was indeed a service dog. I again flashed my card. He gave us the impression that he did not trust his own hostess, because with these things you communicate with your staff, you do not bother your guests anymore after they have been through the entire process of proving that the dog is a service dog. It would be the same if a waiter takes your order, writes it down and before serving your food, the general manager would come by your table, shake your hand and ask: ""what did you order again?""This is not only very unprofessional from the manager, but it must have made the hostess feel very uncomfortable. The food was fair, but not extraordinary. While exiting the restaurant we let the hostess know that we did not think the attitude of the general manager was professional, that in these instances the internal communication should suffice. She smiled awkwardly and said: ""ne vous inquietez pas"" or ""don't worry"", well WE did not worry at all, because we will never go back tot this restaurant, it is THEY who should worry and avoid such unprofessional situations in the future.",2,1,0,Stéphanie C.,"Antwerp, Belgium",1,11,0

1.0,12/20/2015,"Last evening, we had a pre-Christmas dinner with our 2 children and their spouses, our annual tradition. We always choose a special location. Our dinner began at 8:15 with the waiter, who was rushing, smashing a wine glass on our table. Glass went everywhere. Our son-in-law felt a shard hit his face and had to go to the restroom to make certain he was not cut. The staff cleared everything off the table and the banquette to clear all of the glass and then re-set the entire table. The waiter did apologize. He continued to rush, and one of the busboys also dropped the silverware. We all took a deep breath and eventually things settled down and our dinner proceeded. At one point, the waiter asked if we wanted more bread. We said yes. He never brought it. Eventually we asked the busboy and he brought it. Shortly thereafter, before we could consume the bread, the staff cleared the bread plates away and took the bread in order to make room for our entrees. We ordered 3 different wines during our dinner, and they were each delicious, but I was looking for a particular pairing with our food. But, with each wine, we of course received a new glass, and in keeping with the staff rushing us, we had 3 glasses for virtually all 6 of us, so at one point we had nearly 18 glasses on the table. It seemed that they could not push the wine fast enough, even though I said we would finish the prior bottle before consuming the next. That seemed to fall on deaf ears. All but one of us really enjoyed our meals. The food was delicious. My son really loved his steak, in particular. But, would we go back? I doubt it. I told the woman who brought the bill that I would only give a 15 percent tip because of the service. She apologized when she came back with the bill and said she had spoken with Georgette who offered us free desserts. But, at that point we had already paid the bill and were departing.

3.0,8/14/2015,"Ohhhh Rotisserie Georgette, How i really wanted to give you 4-5 stars. First off, let me say this, this restaurant would be better off taking the word ""Rotisserie""  off from of it's name. It makes it feel a bit less elegant and classy when you tell people where you dined. The Ambiance is gorgeous. Beautiful elegant decor, and all patrons were well dressed. The Service was great. The waiter, bus boys, and host were VERY attentive. The famous Georgette was even on hand that night and made her way from table to table. It was nice chatting her up and meeting the famed Jean George protege.  However, I  had to lie a bit to her about the food. And it's not a knock on the restaurant itself, because the food was good, but that's it. Good, not great or anything to write home about. See below. My girlfriend and I shared the Roasted Artichoke and the smoked salmon appetizer. Both of them were pretty good.  Enough to get the belly warm for the much anticipated Poule De Luxe for two!  The chicken arrives very shortly after the appetizers were cleared, and I personally would have liked a little more time in between coursed, but whatever, we  were hungry. The chicken was placed on the table. And that was that. It would have been nice had the server properly dished out the Chicken for two for us. It would have provided a bit more of that elegant touch that the ambiance is providing us with.  I mean, I am paying for a pricey chicken in a nice restaurant, right?  The roasted chicken itself was perfectly cooked. very moist, and tender, and well seasoned. The Au Jus was perfect. Not too salty or overwhelming on the chicken. However , the wild rice/ mushroom stuffing in the chicken breast was very scarce and hardly even there which was disappointing because it sounded delicious on the menu. The lacking of the stuffing was however made up by two generous pieces of perfectly seared Foie Gras. As for sides, we had the snap peas and Pomme Frites. Snap Peas were good, but the fries were a bit soggy. Disappointing, but again, not why we were there. Back to the chicken... Was it the best roasted chicken I've ever had? God No. Not even close. Which is why I am not giving this restaurant higher than 3 stars. The price of the meal well as  the elegant atmosphere, I was a bit underwhelmed and I guess expecting a bit more.There was nothing that I ate that had that WOW factor. For what you would pay for the Poule De Luxe, you can easily have had a much tastier chicken from Pio or dare I even say Boston Market? Now, this is not saying that the chicken was bad, because it wasn't  it was just ""Good"". in New York City, being just  ""Good"" likely won't get me back.",4,0,1,M N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0

4.0,5/17/2015,"Early Sunday evening, family dinner; I wanted someplace special for my roasted chicken fans. Salad G and crispy artichokes to start were just right:  greens, cheese, pears, fruit and lardons were in perfect balance, and we had enough aioli left over to empty the bread basket with our mopping-up effort. The roasted chicken was exquisite and plenteous. The Sunday roast (lamb joint) was superb: succulent, flavorful meat fell off the bone with a gentle touch of the knife. Sides were terrific, particularly the crispy artichokes, roasted carrots and roasted potatoes. Mixed drink and wine selection (by the glass - I can't comment on the full-bottle list) was well-suited to the menu. Mixed drinks perhaps a little small but with subtle, complementary flavors. My sancerre rosE was a perfect match for the lamb: ample fruit and good value.None of us had room for dessert. Hard for me to imagine anyone having a complaint about portion size.The room was quite quiet and this suited our gathering just fine. We were attentively and intelligently served.Do dress up, even on an off night:  I was jacketless and felt a trifle underdressed.

2.0,5/10/2015,"The best part about Rotisserie Georgette is that you get to imagine what it would be like dining in a mausoleum. The windowless room with high walls feels like a tomb. Maybe it would be nice on a cold winter night, but not on a bright summer day. As for the meal, eh. The food has a morbid quality of its own. The chicken is unexceptional and presented in a way that is downright unappetizing, and the jus that comes with it doesn't taste right (as my dining companion put it, ""the herbs are wrong!"") The fries are too thick. The salad is lame. Correction: the best part about Rotisserie Georgette is that the service is so fast (because the food is pre-cooked and maybe even pre-plated) that you can eat and get back outside quickly and remember that, even after spending $100 for lunch for two, life goes on.",5,3,1,David A.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,43,0

No pretense here.  The Duck duck appetizer featured just salty enough, firm mousse with evil fried duck skin morsels like you would get your hand slapped for stealing from the roasting pan before poultry went skinless, boneless and boring.  The rotisserie chicken was crispy moist and full of flavor.  The catch of the day was a delicate and light Bronzino full of herbed flavor without oil and butter.  The sautéed mushrooms were hot and juicy with a mild black truffle sauce that did not overwhelm the taste of the mushrooms.  Th rotisserie potatoes were no humble spuds - crispy crusted garlicky bites that melted in your mouth.  The coffee pot de creme was light but rich if that's possible, the chocolate Madeleine's were perfect conduits for the caramel dipping sauce that was almost a butterscotch.  A great cocktail list, fabulous bar and bountiful wine list as well.

If you ever have the chance to go, GO. We bypassed the rest of the menu and headed straight for the half rotisserie chicken with herbs de Provence (there were two other sauces available, but we went for the traditional), and the rotisserie potatoes, mushrooms, pommes frites and spinach as our sides. Since there were three of us, our server took it upon himself to bring the other sauces as well so we could try them all. They were all delicious, but honestly the chicken is so flavorful, and the skin so perfect, that it needs none of them. The sides were all wonderfully flavorful and garlicky, our favorite being the rotisserie potatoes with their chicken-fat crisped skins. BLISS.We couldn't leave without dessert and debated the lemon pot du creme, chocolate mini-madeleines with salted caramel of chocolate souffle and chocolate chaud (very adult hot chocolate).

I made a reservation, and we showed up at 12:30, looking forward to a nice boozy lunch. After being seated our waiter appeared and asked us if we wanted still, sparkling, or table water. I said ""DeBlasio please"", and we didn't see him again for over 10 minutes. We flagged him down to give him our drink (and food order) which was their signature whole chicken with foie gras (76 dollars). He left and someone else came back with the drink and we didn't see anyone for 20 minutes. He shows up and says our chicken will take too long (45 minutes) we should order something else. He says the half chicken, frites and salad (29 dollars) will come right out, and we should get that. I don't want to be a pain, and it's already 30 minutes in, so I say fine, lets do that. 15 minutes later, he comes back and says they can do the whole chicken, and that will be right out. So, by now, this is almost an hour, everyone around us has gotten entrees, and my mother is starving and a little drunk. By the way, people watching? Read no more and go there right now. Think of it as a 200 dollar cover charge to see some truly unique individuals. At this point some woman (Georgette?) comes over and says how sorry she is that our lunch is taking forever she'll ""make it up to us"". How about some more bread? Finally chicken shows up, hooray. It's very good, but at this point all we can do is laugh about how the staff is ignoring us. Our waiter? Nowhere to be seen. We eat ravenously, had to flag down the coat check girl for another glass of wine, then we sat, giggling in front of our plates until we flagged down a busboy to clear our plates. I heard our waiter give specials for dessert to other tables, and when we had to flag down the bartender (seriously) for dessert menus, our waiter came over, literally tossed the dessert menus on our table, then walked away. When I asked if there were specials, he actually rolled his eyes, then said something about ""quince pie"". I had heard him talk about a tarte tartin to another table and when I mention that he rolled his eyes again and said they had that. At that point, I had had enough of this ridiculous place, and asked for the check. I was given the check very quickly (Finally!) and there were no discounts, and no visit from anyone in management apologize for the truly awful service. That's fine, I wasn't looking for anything free, I was happy to pay the check and get out of there. Did I mention the coat check girl forget my mothers hat? Honestly, this place stinks, maybe Georgette is independently wealthy, and it doesn't matter if they make money or not, the whole experience was a total let down, and it's a shame that we were treated so badly.

4.0,11/24/2014,"80%Very capable, decadent French restaurant with emphasis on meats and richer dishes.***Came here for dinner, Nov '14.  I foolishly came alone and ordered too much.The restaurant Rotisserie Georgette appears to be a french restaurant, that from my guess tends to serve bistro cuisine with a heavier leaning on preparing meats.  The menu is more focused on fowl, with chicken in particular.  Nonetheless, the menu on the evening I visited also included guinea hen, duck, and a special dish featuring partridge. Many of the dishes from the dinner menu are large and meant to be shared among two ambitious appetites or among a larger number of more civil diners. Dining at Rotisserie Georgette was a very good and memorable experience overall.  Although I've enjoyed many types of French cooking, I don't recall having a similar experience elsewhere which may be the result of the style of cooking or a measure of the chef's preferences.  I'll get into describing the food, value, ambiance, service, and other notes.  This will be a longer review with at least one update.  I wrote a lot of notes which I'll reserve for a later review to updated later.I ordered three items for my meal.Duck rillettes (rillettes de jour/ of the day) $18.  (Dish rating 71%)-Good starter, that proved to be just as decadent as the name implies. Flavors are more buttery than anything else, although the duck gradually emerges its presence and carries through, lingering on the palate.   There is a mild saltiness that compliments the duck nicely I do wish the duck had a stronger presence, but I worked overall.- Texture is not unpredictably also buttery with small morsel of chewy duck in between.  The chilled temperature, jelly on top, and crunchy toast seemed to cut down on the heaviness.""Poule De Luxe"" Whole Roast Chicken, Wild Mushroom Stuffed Breast, Seared Foie Gras, Jus. $36 per person, 2 person minimum, and $72 for my dish.  (dish rating 88%) - Portion size is huge and seems better suited for four diners.- The entire chicken, notably the breast was wonderfully tender, and the skin crunchy but not dry.  - Flavor of the chicken was intense in that the meat had a metallic, liver like character to it that worked well along with a very nice brine.  The saltiness that came with this was rich without being intense.- The seared foie's liver like finish was milder and blended in better than expected with the chicken, and added additional buttery richness to the chicken.  It was a great condiment.  Ile Flottante.  Meringue, Crème Anglaise, Caramelized Pistachios.  $14.  (dish rating 83%)-Generally straightforward, but slightly richer, and with a generous portion size.- I liked the additional nuttiness in flavor provided by the generous mound of chopped and candied pistachios.- Between the thicker creme anglaise, crunchy pistachios, and hardened caramel, the textures were more aggressive and lent this interpretation of a classic dessert a more masculine character.  It was very good and consistent with the character of other dishes.- Having a black assam tea seemed to work well as an unconventional and unintentional pairing, with the spices of the tea blending into the vanilla creme in a fun and oddly enjoyable manner. Value is good.  Prices are higher, but I think its justified with the quality and effort in execution overall, and much heartier than average portion sizes.  Lunch menu prices may be more budget friendly.Service was very attentive.  The staff and manager were diligent in requesting feedback and offering assistance without being overbearing.  The manager was knowledgeable and enthusiastic with regards to how dishes were prepared.I liked the ambiance.  Although a tad rowdy for relaxed conversation, I didn't find it to be a distraction.  The jazz played was comfortable and set at reasonable volume.  I loved the ornate decor and collection of mirrors set on the wall.  The lighting is soft without being gloomy.I recommend Rotisserie Georgette overall.  However, I do think the dinner dining experience is more likely to reward groups rather than the singe diner.",3,1,0,Adrian Robert H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",720,350,1747
2.0,11/21/2014,Unfortunately my dinner was not as good as last season. My chicken was over cooked and tough. At $24.00 for a half chicken it could have had a more flavorful taste.

3.0,9/22/2014,"Midtown East is a difficult dining location with a proliferation of over-priced restaurants serving mediocre fare to one-and-done tourist clientele or expense account lunchtime meal seekers.Rotisserie Georgette was a pleasant surprise.  The decor is warm and inviting and the space has tall ceilings allowing for the almost too close together tables to not feel terribly cramped.The waitstaff seem to strive to accommodate diners, especially in a group setting.  Our party of four split three apps, four orders of chicken, three sides and two desserts.  It was a lot of food - the non-gluttonous party would have been fine with two apps and two sides.Don't bother with the overdone chicken deluxe, stick to the basic $24 half bird.  They will also allow you to select more than one accompanying sauce if you are undecided. The roasted potatoes, while a very very generous serving, were a salt bomb.  I'm a devotee of fleur de sel and adore salt, so for me to say the potatoes were too salty means they basically were licking a salt stone.  The take on a twice baked potato was much better, but a much smaller portion.The salad G was also good, but make sure you like lardons if ordering it because they dominated the salad.Desserts were average at best and I'd recommend skipping dessert here in favor of a stop at nearby Momofuku Milk Bar.Wine list is stellar, but beware, no bottles are under $60 and wines by the glass are commensurately pricey.",3,0,1,Emma D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0
3.0,9/9/2014,"There are things that I loved about my experience here last night and a few things that would probably hinder my return. I had an early reservation on a Monday night and when I walked in the Hostess was gracious and allowed me to sit at my table to wait for my frined. The place is lovely and I did feel like I was waiting for my grammy to have a nice ladies lunch. The service is top notch, you are never left alone for more than a few minutes but not in an intrusive way. To start I tried the 60th Manhattan and wowie, did that pack a punch! Any bourbon lover out there should definitely try it. When my friend arrived she ordered the cosmo that was on the cocktail menu, I didn't try it but she said it was a touch too sweet. We wanted to order a bottle of wine and I noticed they had a Merlot from Mendocino County, a 2009 Brutocao that is from a great producer only to find out they were out of it. We tried a few reds by the glass to decide what we wanted bottle-wise, the Meritxell Palleja Priorat was horrible. We mentioned to our waiter that maybe the bottle had been opened for a while and he insisted it was newly opened, OK, I'm not here to argue with you then the wine is just bad! We then tried the Cotes du Rhone and the 2002 Haut-Medoc Bordeaux which was the winner. A pet peeve of mine is when a waiter argues with you over what a wine is doing for you, I've studied wine and have taken my introductory Sommelier so I know a touch more than the average bear, know your audience before you condescend. My friend wasn't very hungry so we didn't order a ton but here's the rundown:1. Heirloom tomato salad with ricotta salata, caper berries, basil and red wine vinegar - this was good but not out of this world.2. The chicken for two - grande mere sauce for her, provencal for me. Now when you are known for one thing and have a very limited menu you better do that one thing pretty darn spectacular. I found the skin on my chicken perfectly crispy but alas, it was a bit dry, the worst thing that can happen to a chicken. The sauces were meh so that didn't help all that much there.3. Fava beans, onion soubise, crispy shallots - you would be best served by just ordering this side dish. This was easily the best way I've ever encountered fava beans. There was some type of foam on top, I suspect cream but the waiter said no, whatever it is, it's fantastic.That was the extent of our culinary experience and for well over $100 a piece, I think not. I'm glad I finally tried it but doubt I would return.",3,0,1,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

4.0,9/1/2014,"Listening to NPR while stuck in CT (what a parking lot) I heard a review for Rotisserie Georgette that claimed chef Chad Brauze under the tutelage of Georgette Farkas served the best chicken in the metro area. My girlfriend, who herself makes a damn good roast chicken, decided we should go that night as we had commitments in the area.First off, gorgeous interior. The open kitchen and well adored walls create a beautiful ambience, as do the leather-smock-laden servers.Wearing Seersucker shorts and and a dress shirt I felt a bit underdressed but comfortable. The started bread was wonderful and we skipped to ordering main dishes quickly.For me: The special baby chicken with Provencal sauce with a side of the oh so delicious roast potatoes. For her: Poulet Roti with Chimichuri sauce with a side of ""stuffed and crisp"".Portions were generous. My baby chicken was moist and well flavored. Her poulet roti was a winner. The roast potatoes and crisps were both winners, with the roast potatoes moist and brown, the crisps creamy and delicate.Stuffed Georgette came to speak with us and encouraged us to indulge in dessert. We planned on sharing the Bittersweet Chocolate Pot-De-Creme which was a massive mug filled which tiny crunchy chocolate balls over a dark mouse with some cake in there. Georgette was kind enough to send us a complementary fruit and sorbet platter which the girlfriend ate every bite of despite claiming she was full.The bill was about average from the area, if a bit high for the simplicity of the food (if two cocktails came with the meal the price of $115 with tip would have been damn reasonable). Nevertheless we are planning to return. The food was delicious, decor inviting and the personal charm of Ms. Farkas and our un-intrussive waiter made it a lovely night.As a side note, the table next to us accommodated a woman with a gorgeous seeing-eye dog. We spoke with her and she complemented the waitstaff on their ability to help her enjoy her meal and the care they took not to step on her service dog who sat happily under the table, giving doe eyes to me every time I took a bite of chicken.",0,0,0,Maxwell R.,"Providence, RI",3,14,2

We arrived at 9:35 pm for our 9:45 pm reservation. The restaurant was packed. After a few minutes, we were shown to our table - the worst one in the restaurant (right by the kitchen with a lot of traffic and noise). It was the only one available. We explained to the hostess that we could wait for a better table. She was super nice about it. She took us back to the bar area and told us that more tables would be available soon. About 10 minutes later another bad table became available. To our surprise, she didn't call us. Another group got it. Then, about 5 minutes after that she called us. As she took us to our table (a great one), she explained that she didn't give us the second table because it was still close to the kitchen and the noise, and she knew we wouldn't like it. How refreshing!!!! We are so used to begging and pleading for a good table that I could not believe that a hostess would would try to find us a nice table.

5.0,2/20/2014,"I never thought rotisserie chicken was that special; I mean, I can get a relatively tasty version at Wal-Mart for less than $10. But the chicken here is quite clearly a wholly different experience.The interior is gorgeous, with poultry-themed artwork and a pretty white/blue color scheme. Vaulted ceilings add the feeling of spaciousness. The ambiance is upscale but homey, like visiting your rich friend's country house. Our group sat in the private dining room in the back, which seats about 10 people at a round table. It looked a bit cramped, but the table was large enough that we all had enough room to eat. Service, of course, was impeccable; our waiter was very knowledgeable about menu items and we felt well taken care of. (It probably didn't hurt that we were guests of the owner. Thanks for everything, Georgette!!)The poulet frites. Oh man. Definitely worth the $29. It comes with four hearty pieces of chicken that are extremely tender and juicy. It'll make you wonder why you're not eating chicken for every meal (probably because you'd never be able to get it this tasty). It made me want to reread ""Chicken Trek"" by Stephen Manes (great book). It was the kind of deliciousness that left me satisfied after eating only one piece, though that sentiment didn't apply to my companions, most of whom cleaned their plates. The accompanying jus provençal added a delicate flavor.I loved the salad, too, which was a simple plate of mixed greens and mustard vinaigrette, but somehow they got it to taste rich as if drizzled with ranch. The herbed fries were good too, but a bit soft for my liking. Afterward, we were served massive bowls of ice cream with big spoons for maximum gluttony. They came with a side of crumbled cookie and some kind of sweet buttered/cream sauce. (This place is all about the sauce!) We also had the chocolate souffle cake, which was rich in texture and bittersweet, and came with its own little thing of sauce. Everything was soo good.

4.0,2/19/2014,"Had a great lunch at Rotisserie Georgette on President's Day. The restaurant was pretty packed as this has become a very popular restaurant. Definitely a favorite for the power lunch scene, as well as the uppity Upper East side clientele. The service was superb, which I expected since Georgette Farkas hails from the Daniel Boulud empire. She was actually walking around speaking to guests and made a point to ensure my lunch was satisfying. The lady at the table next to me was acting obnoxious and being annoying the while time and literally put the poor female server (who I also had) through hell. Still, she did not blink and eye or seem frustrated. A testament to their dedication to providing quality service to their customers.Items eaten include:Mushroom gnocchi with parmesan- Properly cooked gnocchi. Soft, yet light and not gummy. There were what looked like flecks of truffle in there and I think I tasted some in the gnocchi. Gnocchi, mushrooms, and parmesan is a classic combination and is hard to not taste good. Everything worked, I just wish the sauce popped a bit more.Chicken pot pie- This is the main reason I came. It's not offered at dinner only at lunch. It arrives in grand fashion- the dark meat roasted chicken, carrots, potatoes and porcinis in a mushroom like stock are hidden under a perfectly crisp dome of puff pastry. Be careful though, as you will undoubtedly burn your mouth for the first 10 minutes or so eating this. It is piping hot, which I usually love, but it made it very tough to eat. Overall, this was very good, but of course the best part like any other pot pie was the crust. As for the inside, I didn't detect anything particularly different or special that would set this apart or warrant the $24 price tag. A bit overrpriced in my opinion, but again, welcome to a hot new place on the Upper East side that can get away with it. The side salad that came with it was simply dressed, nothing memorable. Just a garnish to convince yourself you're eating something healthy.Stuffed baked potato- Again, piping hot! Parmesan mashed potatoes stuffed inside a baked potato. Again not breaking the mold here, but solid. They do have nerve to charge $12 for a baked potato though. Brown butter parfait- Without a doubt the best thing I had at RG. And one of the best desserts I've had. Three enormous scoops of brown butter ice cream, sitting on dark chocolate ice cream, and crowned with whipped cream. They give you some brown butter sauce and chocolate cake pieces on the side to make it a ""build your own sundae. The brown butter sauce hardened like that magic shell stuff we all had as a kid and took on a white chocolate flavor. The chocolate pieces added texture and more flavor. Overall, a terrific sundae and this time I didn't mind paying the $12 price tag for it!!Overall, everything was delicious. I'm giving it 4 stars because nothing on the savory end stuck out to me as ""must come back for"". And the prices are a bit on the high end for what they are putting out. Simple food done right. RG definitely warrants a repeat visit for dinner to try their chicken for two with foie gras and mushroom stuffing.",2,0,0,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798
4.0,2/18/2014,"KenScale: 8.0/10Rotisserie Georgette is a new French restaurant from Georgette Farkes, formerly acclaimed chef Daniel Boulud's director of public relations, and chef David Malbequi. I have been wanting to come visit this place for a long time with the growing reputation of its rotesserie chicken dishes. I braved through the snow last weekend to finally make it, and was not disappointed. I started the meal with gnocchi and grilled octopus. Both dishes were solid, with soft texture of gnocchi and tender octopus that had fairly balanced flavor. For the main dish, I had to go with Poule de Luxe, a whole roasted chicken with two with wild mushroom stuffed breast and seared foie gras. I feel like rotisserie chicken is one of those dishes that are deceptively hard to pull off. Not only should the meat be absolutely tender, but the flavor should make sure that the meat is neither too salty nor bland. I haven't quite found a restaurant that has achieved this feat until Rotisserie Georgette. I absolutely loved the chicken's delicate flavor and texture (hefty price at $36 per head notwithstanding), and couldn't stop tearing apart this bird until I was so full I couldn't breathe. I still think The NoMad's chicken for two is at the top of the chicken dish hierarchy, but this restaurant's roasted version is not far behind. For dessert, I went with the delicious chocolate souffle cake.Once the words got out about the restaurant's chicken dishes, it's been harder to secure a reservation here, so make sure to book in advance or maybe show up early to see if any tables for walk-ins or bars are available to dine at. The restaurant's decor is modern, and given the location of the place on the Upper East Side, it was filled with crowds on the older side. The restaurant has a full bar menu with solid wine selections from France and other parts of the world. When I walked in to the restaurant, Ms. Farkes herself was greeting every diner and we chatted briefly about her new restaurant.

What a mistake!  The sauce rendered the nice crispy chicken skin into something resembling wet tissue paper. And the already nice and moist chicken, now looked and tasted rather soggy.  What was that sauce for? Was it actually salad dressing?  If so, why was it on the plate with the children?

4.0,1/23/2014,"This place is definitely the real deal. People seem to love the fancy dinner version of the chicken that is packed with mushrooms and foie but, honestly, I think they save their best dish for lunch when you can get an unadorned roasted half-chicken similar to the herbed one but more straight-up, cooked to perfection, and with a really wonderful jus. Anyone afraid of dropping the serious change that comes along with dinner here can at least get their feet wet with this pretty awesome version of their world-class roast chicken.  ($29)The only better roasted chicken I've had was at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco. For NYC this is definitely where it's at.  I don't really go for the overdone NoMad style of serving chicken + fatty stuff + other overbearing flavors. So, if you are looking for a roast chicken experience during which you can actually taste roast chicken, try the Provencal Chicken or try the place for lunch. Really excellent and with an extremely attentive staff. I also want to mention they serve this little salad with lunch too that is killer. Anyway, do get the famous fancy dinner-time chicken if you like that sort of thing, but please don't think this is a spot for overdone food. It really isn't. It is just food done very, very well.",4,0,0,Paul A.,"New York, NY",270,403,462

5.0,1/18/2014,"ABSOLUTELY GREAT! Went for my husband's birthday with mom and sister.  They gave us the booth in the back, it was perfect; so very intimate, quiet and cozy. Food:  FANTASTIC! To start we had the special which was an order of large prawns that were in the rotisserie.  Ordered the Duck, the Lamb and the Chicken with the mushroom and Foie gras stuffing. For a side we did the Parmesan Potato and the Rotisserie Potatoes.   The Lamb was such a good piece of meat, it was tender, it was so full of flavor! The duck was great, definitely NOT as fattening as most duck dishes you have had.  And the chicken was phenomenal.  It was so very good.  The flavor was packed immense and just so good. Drink:  Great wine menu.  We ordered a few bottles of champagne.  Desert: By the time we got to desert I was so full and satisfied that I didn't need desert, which was a first for any restaurant I have been to.  We ordered the chocolate souffle thing and the special that was like ice cream with caramel and chocolate crunchies.  LOL OMG all of this reminiscing is making me so hungry. Service:  AMAZING! From the bartenders at the bar, to the hostess ... to the waiter to the OWNER!  Everyone came by to say hello, have a small conversation and all remembered to say Happy Birthday to my husband, which was just too sweet!!Decor: Simple, very elegant....lots of marble/tile and blue print, mirrors, great fabrics...it was decorated very well.  Like the menu it's simple, elegant and perfectly prepared. This place had a revolving door of people in and out...the crowd is very UES (lots of fur and Cartier watches), you're dining with a great crowd.  It didn't matter who walked in, everyone was so attentive and just amazing.  It was perfect.  Thank you for making my husband's birthday awesome.  I recommend to everyone and anyone to go ASAP!!!

4.0,1/12/2014,"Chicken is a lot like pizza - you can get a mediocre bite and it's still edible but when you get a fantastic piece, it's a total come-to-Jesus food moment.  Last night, I found the latter at Rotisserie Georgette... and yes, I prayed...for more.This is where simple luxury meets cozy cottage cooking - think herbs of provence tucked among perfectly golden brown roasts of chicken.  I like starting with the Grilled Octopus Grenobloise with potatoes, tomato confit, lemon, capers and mini croutons ($19).  I know you may be distracted by the rest of the menu but absolutely do not let yourself stray from the plan - get the Poulet Roti, a half roasted organic Zimmerman Farm chicken slow cooked and served with your choice of sauce.  I like the Grande Mère jus with red wine, mushrooms and bacon ($24).  If you come with a large group, encourage your friends to order the Baby Pig (stop crying, it's not Wilbur... plus you didn't even really like the book, remember?) with bacon, onion marmalade and red wine jus - you'll need to order this 72hrs in advance so be strategic.  If you have my favorite waiter Daniel, he won't let you leave without trying the Tarte Tatin for Two with crème fraiche ($18).Among the warm but elegant French countryside interior, you'll find fresh wholesome ingredients cooked to perfection by all-star Chef David Malbequi.  And who to thank for such a filling feast? Georgette, of course! Georgette Farkas, a French-speaking Harvard grad, was the former director of marketing and PR at Boulud's Dinex group (read as: head of the fab Frenchman's brain trust)... so you know you're in impeccibly, well bejeweled hands.Best of all, and since it looks like we'll be in this 'Polar Vortex' for quite some time...

4.0,1/9/2014,"My parents came up to NYC in December 2013. Dad had a conference, but it was also an opportunity for me and my husband to spend time with them. Their first night, New York had some yucky weather. But inside Rotisserie Georgette, it was warm and pleasant. Georgette Farkas, the proprietress, even swung by the table as my husband and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive to make sure we had bread and cocktails. I had a lot of time to study the menu, and I want to go back and try several more starters. That night I ordered the consommé (weather was a good excuse, and I appreciate when that dish is on a menu, it's so tedious to prepare). My father ordered the octopus, mom the salade Francine which she shared with me and husband, the foie gras terrine (I think he got that). Everything was well-presented and tasty. Both couples opted to try the Poule de Luxe, which definitely gives the famous chicken at The Nomad a run for its money at first glance. But, this preparation is a bit different. We felt this chicken gave you more foie gras, but was somehow more fairly priced. You can peek into the kitchen to see rotisserie ovens spinning succelent chickens, so I am not sure how a guest wouldn't be tempted to try one of the two chicken entrées. Plus among several side dishes, this restaurant offers four preparations of potatoes (under a header of ""Never Enough Potatoes""). We shared the rotisserie potatoes, the brussel sprouts and the cauliflower steak. Farkas came by to recommend tarte tatin for dessert and I'm paying that forward to any reader now.",1,0,0,Cara M.,"Manhattan, NY",19,48,14

4.0,12/29/2013,"Chicken for $29 sounds silly, but you get what you pay for here in service and atmosphere.From the moment you walk in and you get a glimpse of some of the tables in the front with seats that look like thrones, you know you are in for a decadent experience.We arrived right when they opened for lunch on Saturday at noon and were shown to a cozy banquette table in the back, allowing us to take in the beautiful decor and the ballet dining room on the way.I was disappointed to see that we didn't get any bread, which is very expected at a place like this, especially when you see the butter knife and bread plate on the table. Much later in the meal after a few more tables arrived and did in fact receive bread upon sitting, I was infuriated at first, but I calmed down since we were already stuffed and the bread didn't look very good anyway. Still, not cool - what if I was some critic that wrote reviews that people cared about reading?Anyway, on to the food we did pay for, and boy did we pay:- Gnocchi a la Parisienne ($16 appetizer portion)This was really excellent. Delicious, creamy gnocchi and mushrooms in an awesome sauce that would have been really great for soaking up with some bread. I think this is one of the best choices to start with, as opposed to a $25+ salad.- Poulet Roti Sliders ($22 for 3)This was the best bite of the meal. You get three decent sized sliders with really delicious pulled chicken and onion-apple marmalade on buttery soft brioche buns. Some may say $7+ plus for a slider is a little silly, but this dish is definitely worth it here. It also comes with a little side salad, so this is a good choice for a main entree here.- Poulet Frites ($29)This is the specialty here, which gets you a few pieces of the rotisserie chicken and some of the pommes frites to go with it. There was one really amazing piece of chicken, which was so succulent and juicy and tasted incredibly good with the bit of charred skin on it, but the other few pieces were mostly throwaway. The leg had about one good bite of meat on it, and the other piece (maybe a thigh?) was also mostly bone and cartilage. The fries were pretty good, with a nice seasoning, but they could have been much crispier.- Stuffed, Crisped Potatoes ($12)This was a really amazing side of potatoes, that looks as impressive as it sounds - it's a baked Idaho potato stuffed with Parmesan mashed potatoes. The baked potato skin is nice and crispy, while the inner potatoes are incredibly smooth and silky soft. This is a must, and one of the few times I've preferred the mashed to the fried potatoes.- Chocolate Pot de Creme ($12)For dessert, we went with the pot de creme, which was definitely the best-sounding choice. I don't think I've ever actually tried pot de creme before, so I don't have a frame of reference, but just in terms of sweets, this was an outstanding dessert. It's a small cup consisting of some hot, pudding-like chocolate that was so rich and delicious. So rich. There is also a cool bit of whipped cream on top, that complements the hot, rich chocolate perfectly. Now I know I really like pot de creme.At these prices, and the fact that the menu is actually pretty limited, I don't think I need to return. I tried the chicken, and that's basically all you need (no $27 salad for me, thank you).

At 9:25 they were told that they needed to order their food now because the chef was leaving early to head home. Look I know it's the holidays and people should be with their families, but then the restaurant should not have let me make my reservation if they were going to close early . Upon arriving after my party I was surprised to see a still full dining room. After being rushed to the table to order. Service was rushed and I felt like I was being forced out. Desert order was taken before my plate was even done. After desert was done our checked was drop by the waitress without checking if we wanted anything else.

There are places in town with more refined food, a more dramatic look, a louder buzz, and white-glove service, but there are few restaurants that have it all in the way that Georgette has created at her first place post-Boulud.  The color scheme and lighting are comforting with beautiful ceramic-tiled walls, framed mirrors, and a partially open kitchen providing warmth. The tables actually had space between them. Service was informally professional. And the food and wine were great. The menu is relatively short with a few party specials like whole pig, bit it was still hard to choose among many tempting choices. We had delicious octopus and gnocchi as starters with bread as soft inside as it was crusty outside. We shared the special chicken for two with mushroom stuffing and foie gras; it not only stood up to my gold standard for over-the-top chicken (Nomad's, of course), but the bird was big enough to keep two hefty eaters from even peeking at the deserts. Wines, mostly French, were not your typical labels and fairly priced, especially the generous pours of several by the glass at $10-13, but, unfortunately, not including one bottle under $40.

4.0,11/17/2013,"I'm normally leery of trying a new restaurant so early on, as service kinks can cloud the experience, but Rotisserie Georgette had its ducks (and chickens) in a row on week two.  The restaurant has the right kind of noise -- lively conversations, not pumped in music -- and a focused menu.  We ordered the Salade G (big enough for two people to split), the Poule de Luxe and their mashed potato filled baked potato side.  The gnocchi looked good on the menu and at the table next to us, but a rule of mine is whenever I can order  a mashed potato filled baked potato, well, yes please.The chicken for two, at $36 a person, definitely delivered.  The meat was moist, the skin was deliciously seasoned and the mushroom stuffing was perhaps the best part of the dish.  Oh, and there were two pieces of foie gras.  Of recent Chickens For Two I've had, I'd rate RG's over Nomad and slightly behind Marc Forgione's.  With a $55 bottle of wine, tip and tax, ended up being $200 for two.  Fair price for the experience, and there's no stigma about taking leftovers in a doggie bag, so you can get another meal out of it.",10,1,2,Tom E.,"Manhattan, NY",6,47,1
5.0,11/15/2013,"Checked this place out on opening night - I think - and had a lovely time and food. FIRST - This will be my go to place every time I have date or special occasion dinner - it is elegant, while at the same time cozy and unpretentious - and above all, it is quiet with nice jazz playing in the background ... it is so hard to find a place with good food in Manhattan where you also manage to have a decent conversation. This makes it an excellent place to take parents and in laws too.SECOND - the food is wonderful. Just like the ambiance of the place, it is refined but also comforting. I particularly enjoyed the gnocchi (a must have if you go!!! Comes sized either as starter or as entree), and the poule de luxe for two - a generously sized whole bird roasted to perfection with mushroom stuffing and served with seared foie gras and a flavorful jus.  THIRD - in the culinary desert of the UES, where the restaurant scene is sparse and at a price point that often does not match what is served - this resto is very reasonably priced. Mains are between 25 and 40 like in most mid-range places, except here the feel is decidedly more high end. The wine list was also very reasonable, and in fact we had fantastic chateauneuf du pape for less than 60.FOURTH - the service was really wonderful. The Chef even came out to see if we were enjoying our dinner, and the sommelier seemed to know what we had just ordered so he could recommend the wine that best would go with our food ... impressive!!!So, all in all, a great experience!
