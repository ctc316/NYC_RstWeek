4.0,5/2/2019,"My review is for dinner. I came here with my twin and a friend. I had this place on my list for a while..mostly for the outdoor space..but I suppose we'll come back for that. We had a nice simple dinner here. Beautiful space with very professional cordial staff. I ordered the grilled octopus which was cool well, a tiny bit burned, but very tender. My twin ordered the cauliflower dish and my friend the shrimp dish. It was nice. I'll be back for the outdoor area.",0,0,0,Tamira G.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,117,185
5.0,4/27/2019,"This review is for brunch. Narcissa is gorgeous! The indoor space is lovely, with almost a cozy treehouse vibe. They also have a walled off outdoor space that allows for some sun in a more private space. For brunch we shared French toast sticks (amazing) and I enjoyed the vegan chilaquiles. Reasonable menu with slight twists on the usual favorites. Service was great. Would brunch again!",0,0,0,Willow H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,77,131

4.0,4/20/2019,"What a charming restaurant! Lots of seasonal items on the menu with good options for vegetarians. Ask for daily specials! They had the soft shell crab appetizer the day we went and group loved it. The Japanese sweet potato dish was very yummy too. For mains, highly recommend the house special cavatelli truffle pasta. For dessert, we had the buttermilk panna cotta. Was so light and the use of buddha's fingers was a hit! Cocktails are very good as well. They had one on the menu where the proceeds for that drink went to UNICEF. So noble.",1,0,1,Snehal W.,"New York, NY",25,102,4
2.0,4/13/2019,"I used to love this place, but this time is a big let down. The food portion were terribly small (for the reference our bill was at $180 before tips for 3 people and we were only half full). The food itself were either way too sour (narcissa salad) or way too salty ($59.99 ribeye for 2 which I can easily finish it myself). i just wished they brought back their old menu because the current menu is just........ anyway, probably will not come back for it.

1.0,4/7/2019,"When I came here for the first time about 6 months ago I had a pretty good meal. Came back this weekend and had a much worse experience. For starters, you must pay for their bread basket - it only comes with two rolls and one of them is ""nori"" so tasted like fish (disgusting). What's most irritating is that they refuse to replace the gross fish bread with a second piece of normal bread even though you're paying for it.  They even said people make this request all the time but clearly a control freak of a chef won't give the people what they want - bread that doesn't taste like fish...The rest of the food was very hit or miss with good cavatelli but absolutely awful steak. The steak was prepared in some sort of seaweed or nori sauce so it tasted fishy as well. The menu mentioned something about having anchovies on it but it was an entirely different taste than anchovies - honestly tasted like extra oceany seaweed on steak -gross. Should update their menu to include whatever nori seasoning this chef seems to be so obsessed with using on everything. Also the turnips we ordered were very subpar. Lastly service was not great. Waiter never asked us how we liked any of the food so had to go out of our way to share feedback with him after we paid the bill. Definitely will not be coming back as it's overpriced, snooty and not even good anymore.",0,0,0,Lynn C.,"Darien, CT",0,13,1

Our group of four took the advice of our enthusiastic and informative server and ordered the special fry bread with pea hummus and stracietella which came with excellent sourdough.

5.0,3/18/2019,This place is just incredible. Our starter dishes were good but the mains are the stars of the show. Do not leave without getting the Toasted Rye Cavatelli and Fried Chicken.

2.0,3/16/2019,"I think this restaurant has a nice atmosphere, but is extremely overpriced for what you get. My husband ordered almost $40 steak which was smaller than his hand and had zero sides come with it. Bread was like $10. It just felt very overpriced for what you got.

1.0,3/14/2019,"Picked this place for brunch last Sunday and wow, what a disaster. It took 25 minutes to get coffee and lattes. My friend asked for a pot of coffee and they said they couldn't give us one which was fine except...maybe that should be a clue that you should keep the coffee flowing. Nope. The French toast sticks were hot and tasty but nothing outrageous. All of our food came out cold except for the eggs over easy which didn't come out with toast. By the time the wrong toast came out, butter soaked and grilled, the eggs were cold. Wait, there's more. The bacon, if you could call it that, looked grey, pale and not from a pig. It was mostly fat so we sent it back for the Apple sausage which was just okay. Our server was nice but clearly not on top of her game. Through all our complaints nothing was taken off the bill until we asked for the manager who looked as though she had a late night at the bar. We did have a lot of laughs over this disastrous meal, which proves that when in good company you can make the best of a bad situation.",0,0,0,Carrie D.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
2.0,2/24/2019,"Came here on Sunday for brunch and was thoroughly disappointed. I came here after having had a very nice experience at Nix and hearing some good things about Narcissa on its own. There were some rave reviews about the Eggs Benedict, but I'm vegetarian and was hoping to get an Eggs Florentine instead. Sadly, the hollandaise is made pre-mixed with the ham. Ended up ordering the French Toast Bites and the Poached Eggs. These French toast bites looked so pretty; topped with powdered sugar and served with maple syrup and lemon curd. I became a little suspicious when I picked one up and was plain disgusted when I took a bite. They tasted like mini blocks of sawdust; like cardboard - terrible! The poached eggs came with thin slices of avocado toast and a salad - neither of which were particularly good. The eggs were well poached, but the avo toast & salad were well below average.Not sure if I'd want to come back for brunch, but maybe for dinner?",0,0,0,Uma G.,"Charlotte, NC",56,11,29

4.0,1/31/2019,"A few changes to the menu with the changes of the season, and the current menu takes a lot of inspiration from Asia. Dinner was a bit of a hit-or-miss but overall Narcissa always ends up being an enjoyable evening. For this season, go heavy on the appetizers. Parker house rolls (5/5): bread worth paying for, and we actually paid for 2 orders! The only downside about these fragrant unbelievably fluffy rolls is the price tag - $8 for 1 wheat roll and 1 white roll. Scallop Crudo (5/5): it takes something extra to get me excited about crudo, and this comes with extra big flavor. Spiciness toned down with coconut milk, topped with crunch. An excellent bite (savor your 1 bite if you're sharing for 4 people).Beef Tartare (3.5/5): enjoyed the flavors but this was overly seasoned and salty and does not come with bread (save your rolls and/or house bread)Chilled Blue Crab (3.5/5): good thing our waitress cautioned us about the portion. The blue crab is really more of a seasoning for this seaweed-based salad. I really enjoyed eating this, but it's kinda false advertising. Narcissa's Salad (5/5): a perfectly good hearty winter salad with enough mix-ins for interesting bites and an always-welcome shower of parm. Burrata & Mint (5/5): a bowl of barely-held-together milky burrata spiked with bits of spicy chili, tangy lime, and mint. Absolutely must get this. Hen of the woods (4/5): typically one of my favorite things to eat, it was good but I wish it were crispier. The tahini sauce was very tasty. Smoked Japanese Sweet Potato (5/5): I couldn't tell what globs of sauce I was tasting, but it was all delicious. Slightly smoky, starchy satisfying sweet potato, with different chilled sauces spooned over the top. There's way more to this than meets the eye (or listed on the menu). Walnut Miso Roasted Squash (3/5): I was excited for this and was so disappointed! The small butternut squash was bland and underroasted.Red Snapper (3.5/5): the flavors didn't mesh together that well for my tastes, and a bit forgotten on our table. Koji Rubbed Steak (3/5): this was a very chewy piece of meat, and underwhelming and bland as well. Crispy griddled chicken (4/5): Surprisingly my favorite entree. It wasn't very crispy, but it was very juicy and I enjoyed the accompanying sauces and spicy chili paste. It's about half a chicken so plenty to share. Mille Feuille for 2 (5/5): I suspect this portion got smaller, I could definitely eat 1 by myself easily. It's a little different this time with a slightly gamier cream (perhaps goats milk?) but this pastry is truly a delicious work of art. Chocolate Tart (3.5/5): this sad looking little tart is tiny (1/2 star off for that) and not very pretty, but it was a decent dessert. The dark chocolate flavor is intense, and the texture is adequately rich with a nice crust. Service was nice, but not altogether very helpful with guiding us to the better dishes. IMO there were a lot of things distinctively better than others. Also the apps were overwhelming when they arrived all at once, despite telling them to space it out (I guess you'll have to double and triple emphasize it).",6,1,3,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",462,285,1300
2.0,1/12/2019,"We had five dishes in all, and not a single one of them was good, much less excellent. Worst of all was the burrata. So salty that it was inedible. Ceviche was served in a ""creative"" manner but was not as good as your ordinary ceviche. Sweet potatoes had inedibly tough skin, and it goes on and on....On the bright side of things, it's a very pretty, classy room. And the waitstaff are absolutely first rate. Our excellent waitress took this off the bill when I complained. But good vibes from the staff cannot make up for sub-par food.And I felt sorry for the waitresses because of their uniforms. Schoolgirl uniform dresses???? Now if this was some sort bondage/S&M place, I can understand dressing up the ladies that way.

5.0,1/8/2019,"BEST EGGS BENNY MY LITTLE MOUTH HAS EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF ENJOYING. Ok that was the weirdest thing I've ever said I'm so sorry. But it's so true. This place is so bomb I don't even know where to start. Some of the best brunch I've LITERALLY ever had. First of all, they take reservations. GOD BLESS AMERICA. I don't care what you say, I LIVE for places in NYC that take reservations. If you argue ""but the wait is part of the experience!"" or ""The BEST places don't take reservations because if you want to get the best food you have to wait for it"" then you are an actual IDIOT. I love just being able to walk right in and NOT wait 3 hours and get hangry and waste my entire Sunday waiting for a FRIGGIN PANCAKE AND MIMOSA. Ok. So. First of all the ambiance is sheik and clean and hip and alllllll the good things. They aren't trying to hard. There's classic elements and I was living for it. Second of all the service was top notch. Third of all...THE FOOD. OMGGG. The menu was not big. Maybe max 8 options, and don't worry there was vegan/vegetarian for all you hipsters. I love a small menu it ensures quality ingredients and AWESOME food because they can master their dishes. I got the eggs Benedict and I STILL dream about their hollandaise sauce. So light and creamy and not over buttery I could BATHE IN IT. The egg was literally as smooth as butter, the ham was thinly sliced and not giant hunk of disgusting price chopper meat. I'm STILL DREAMING ABOUT THESE EGGS BENNY. You NEED THEM. Darren got the special. It was a potato and root veggie hash with cheese and short rib....yo. He ate the whole thing. It was AMAZING. How do you make root veggies taste good? Guys you need to stop here ASAP I am debating driving 4 hours to NYC ago eat here again because it's that good.

1.0,1/5/2019,"Disappointment incarnate. We've been to narcissa 6 or 7 times since it's opened and have been thrilled each time. Tonight was our first visit since Chef John Fraser left and it will be our LAST. Service was fine. Ambience is good and we rather like the space. Cocktails are good but the beer list remains laughably short. Which brings us to the food. Everything we liked about narcissa is changed. We loved that it was farm to table and chef let their high quality ingredients speak for themselves. Now, everything we had was over seasoned and over sauced. The menu is completely changed for the worse with gimmicky dishes like koji-rubbed skirt steak. Tonight's meal begs many questions. Who smothers branzino in a chili sauce so plentiful you can't even find the fish? This $38 entree was inedible. What happened to the duck breast (formerly their best dish)? Why are the portions so small? Two appetizers, four entrees and two desserts and our party of four got pizza afterwards. What happened to the carrot fries?!I am embarrassed to have recommended this restaurant in the last couple months. I feel like changes so drastic amount to a bait and switch. This meal was overpriced and underdelicious. So disappointed.",1,0,0,Dennis C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

1.0,11/23/2018,"Having had an amazing restaurant experience at Mario Batali's Serra the previous night, we left Narcissa feeling like they are not even in the same league. Narcissa was completely underwhelming in every aspect. Personally, I don't see the appeal of blonde wood, bright lights and iHop style tables and chairs. It was a very cold Thanksgiving night and the draft coming from the window behind us was unacceptable. Our waiter, was pleasant, very attentive and sincere but unrefined. It took 25 minutes to get bread on the table but I have to say, the bread came out hot and freshly baked and absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, it was all down hill from there. We had the Smoky Japanese Sweet Potato which looked way better than it tasted. Very colorful but the smokiness was overwhelming the other flavors. The Mushroom Soup was fine, barely. Pretty basic but the celery garnish added a very nice crunch and texture. The Narcissa Salad also looked better than it tasted, very fresh and colorful but the dressing lacked in flavor, once again, and the fennel was overpowering. I kept digging in thinking I was just missing the dressing but never really did taste any. I think a good vinegar would have made this salad. For the entrees, which came out 1 hour and twenty minutes after we ordered, we had the Koji Steak and two orders of the Turkey Breast and Confit Leg. The turkey was excellent. Very moist and flavorful. Sadly the stuffing and sides were again, underwhelming. The Koji steak was a big mistake since I could still taste the Batali porterhouse I had the night before. This is really just a cheap cut of meat that uses a technique that tries to replicate the aging process. Fail. Very little to zero lean meat on this pile of bones and fat. I have never felt more ripped off in my life. We were getting a little antsy since the food was coming out slow so I asked the waiter to clear the table and bring out the dessert. I needed a new flavor in my mouth pretty bad and to be honest, I was getting annoyed just watching the inefficiency of this place. There appeared to be way too many hostesses, managers, buss boys, etc. The busboys did not smile and had zero table appeal. They did not even keep track of who ordered what having to ask. A well oiled machine can operate without being heard and seen and at this price, they should know which seat gets which meal. This place is far from well oiled. I actually couldn't wait to get up and leave. The dessert came out and I dove right into the foofy little Pumpkin pie and almost spit it out. It had a ginger garnish on it that was once again, overpowering the dish and was too spicy. Just terrible. The Apple Pie was just average. The desserts were obviously pre-prepared and refrigerated. The final act actually took the wind out of our sails. $360.00 for my wife and I and a 3 year old. We just agreed that we have never felt more ripped off and unsatisfied by a meal in our lives. Like I said, I had a $160 steak the night before so I don't shy away from quality, expensive meals.",0,0,0,Mark C.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",0,5,0

1.0,11/22/2018,"One of the worst restaurants in the known universe. Service was adequate, atmosphere no better than that of an upscale airport diner, seats that were closer to the ground than the table. There were three of us. Wine was vintage 2016 and 2017. Every entree was godawful. My short rib steak had no meat on it AT ALL. Total fat and gristle. Seriously, NO MEAT. And this was after I had asked if it was similar to short ribs. Inedible. I sent it back for chicken which was okay but you don't have to be Einstein to make chicken, although I asked for the sauces on the side which was a good idea because they were totally inappropriate. My wife ordered Branzino which was hidden underneath some indescribable sweet orange sauce that killed the the taste of the fish. My daughter had red snapper which was drenched in a bath of curry and tasted like... well...curry. Price with tip --$280.

I went back in September and again on Monday only to find out there seemed to be a significant change. They have a new chef and the vibe has ramped up! I can't begin to tell you all the new dishes on the menu. What!!!! Not to mention the new wine selection.

I had the following:- Fluke Ceviche: Nice, solid, nothing special- Skirt Steak: The chimichurri was well done, and the steak was perfectly cooked, but nothing about it stood out for me.- Cheesecake Sundae: This was the standout of the meal for me, with some really cool flavors and a delicious end to the meal.Anyway, there was nothing wrong with the dinner or the service, it's just that nothing about it stood out either.

If I were to go back I'd be sure to get there earlier. The decor is chic and the food did not disappoint.

If this was simpler, with just the 2 ice creams and jam and a little piece of cake, I would have loved it.It was nicer to sit in the warmth in the backyard than inside, where it was meatlocker-cold.

5.0,7/25/2018,"What an amazing experience! From start to finish, water glass to dessert dish, this establishment is top notch! My friend and I had a Monday night dinner reservation at 7:45pm at the start of restaurant for our first visit to Narcissa. We were greeted nicely, sat promptly, and the waitress reported to the table in perfect time. I wish I could remember her name because she is by far one of the most knowledgeable and personable waitresses I've ever had in nyc, wonderful.We started with the carrot fries before embarking on the prepared menu for restaurant week. Fries were great, and the sauce was just enough to not overpower. I chose to begin with the Rotisserie crisped beets starter.... WOW. I could've had this dish 3 times in one sitting and not had enough. The creamed horseradish made this dish incredible- it's a MUST try.I chose the Carrots Wellington as my main and was very delighted. The blue foot mushrooms were an incredible ingredient in this dish and I was happy that the dish wasn't overpowered with crust.We shared both the cheesecake sundae and vegan rice pudding. I preferred the sundae as the mint whipped cream was basically magic - so amazing! All around incredible experience!

4.0,7/21/2018,"Four years on, Narcissa is now a standby in John Fraser's stable of veggie-forward venues. Can be overlooked, especially when tucked away behind the trendy and well-attended narcbar at the base of the Standard East Village. Balanced dishes fall in line with the 'California cuisine' moniker; you won't leave feeling guilty about your waistband or wallet. Our waitress was excellent, very personable and pleasant to interact with. Great wines by the glass list. Overall, the food and drink are of good quality and quite reasonably priced for NYC. Nice option for a solid meal that is casual and fun.Atmosphere:- Decor feels almost cottage like, with lots of exposed blonde wood, dim lighting, funky seat cushions and proximity to front and back patios.- Chill, but not sedate. Moderate noise level, active but not too loud.- Two tops were were a touch close, but pretty standard for NYC.Food:The cliched descriptor ""farm-to-table New American"" is pretty spot on, but bottom line to me is that the food is clean and balanced. Chef Fraser's menu is flavorful, without being guilt inducing. Execution was good. On this visit, we enjoyed:- Asparagus & Ricotta (poached egg, bacon lardons - $16): Creamy but not overly rich; the asparagus and greens lend a crisp lightness, great for the spring/summer. Recommend.- Narcissa's Salad (market greens, strawberries, smoked gouda, pistachios -$15): Agreeable blend of quality ingredients, maybe just a salad, but still satisfying and a nice way to begin.- Lacquered Duck Breast (rhubarb puree, wax beans, nettle pesto - $39): Well rendered fat and crisp skin, yet moist interior. Good cook, but was rather underseasoned, needed to add salt. Side keeps it balanced.- Pan Seared Lamb (roasted peppers, spiced olive jus, feta polenta - $38): Good lamb flavor, cooked well and full of flavor, the spiced olive jus was tasty. Really enjoyed the feta polenta on the side, so addictive. Heavier of our two entrees.- Mango Vacherin (mango parfait, passion fruit diplomat, sesame meringue, avocado, vanilla sponge cake - $10): A lot of ingredients, but harmonious and neither too sweet nor too heavy. Nice for the summer; creamy and refreshing.BeverageThe by the glass wine list is well-conceived with attractively priced options that you might not see everyday. Everything we tried was good quality to value. In particular, the 2016 Los Bermejos Listan Negro Rose ($15) is a superb rose from the Canary Islands, where the volcano soil lends a nice minerality. Smooth, balanced and nice body. If you like rose, give it a try for something a tad different. We also really enjoyed the 2012 Amezola de la Mora Rioja Crianza ($14) and 2014 François Cazin Cheverny Rouge ($15). Nice selections and great value all around!Sadly their choice in glassware is suboptimal. It's sort of a cheapish/standard squatty glass, which is far too small to allow the aromas to collect and really enjoy their cool wines. I think it may also limit the pour to some extent.Service- Our waitress did a great job - super personable, hospitable and really cared about her work and looking after guests.- Attentive but not intrusive.",0,0,0,D.

2.0,7/7/2018,"We were looking for some July 4th plans and happened to stumble on Narcissa's crab boil special for the holiday--with two of our party of four with Baltimore roots, we thought it'd be perfect, and that $35 per person was a slammin' deal for the amount of food we'd get. We made reservations and the booking site made it seem like tables were a hot commodity, but there were few other patrons when we arrived at 8pm.We were shown to a newspaper-lined table and the feast commenced! Well, kind of. Our first tray delivered was 4 big ribs, 4 slices of cornbread, and a couple servings of cole slaw. I didn't have any of the cole slaw, as mayonnaise-soaked vegetables freak me out, but dug right into the ribs and cornbread, two of my favorite foods. Both had a decent taste to them, but were fairly dry. The ribs were pretty disappointing; they weren't dry-rubbed, St. Louis style, but bbq ribs that had weird dry pockets sporadically throughout. Next was the tray of crabs, shrimp, corn, potatoes, and andouille sausage. We only got three crabs for our party of four, and had to ask if this was correct, at which point they brought us three more--6 total crabs for 4 people. Hmm... okay. The crabs were super tiny and barely had any meat to them. The shrimp and potatoes were fine, but really heavy on the Old Bay. The andouille sausage was weird and dry and unlike any andouille I've ever had. No bueno. The only really stand out part of the tray was the corn, which was super tasty despite being a little bit salty. Dessert was mini pecan pies, which were not too sweet which I appreciated, but otherwise pretty forgettable. The ambiance of the patio was nice, but the service just fine.

2.0,6/26/2018,"Disclaimer: I redownloaded this app so that I could write a review for NarcissaI made a belated father's day reservation last Sunday for 1:30. We were not seated until 1:56. I understand that reservations do not guarantee seating at that exact time, but waiting 25 minutes for a table to be ""set up"" is frankly absurd. Once seated, it took our waiter about 15 minutes to get our order. Then began the wait for the food. We waited 49 minutes for our entrees (keep in mind this is brunch so most of us ordered eggs). Not once did our waiter check up on us to see if we wanted any more drinks, or to apologize for the long wait. Once our food arrived- I asked to speak with the manager. I politely explained how we had spent the whole time waiting, to which she replied that the kitchen was incredibly busy as it feeds the entire hotel. She apologized. Half of the restaurant was empty at the time. The food was average. My fries were cold. My mom's Benedict poached eggs hard boiled. We pointed this out to the waiter- who offered to bring 1 poached egg on a side plate. Really? The manager ended up delivering the poached egg. She laid it down the table without a word. Any other person (especially a manager) would have apologized. Once the bill came- our drinks had been comped. Our waiter didn't even think of saying something along the lines of ""we comped the drinks as an apology for the eggs or the wait..."" Needless to say we won't be coming back. It is incredibly clear that this restaurant is incapable of hospitality (as proven by my interactions with the manager). You need to communicate with your clients.

In general a great experience, the outdoor seating is definitely worth trying for next time's visit.- Apple a day (cocktail) tasted more like a fall drink perfect for a day that's slightly chilly: it was like a cider but more herby and stronger. - Arugula salad(forgot its original name on the menu) was okay. The crispy beets was amazing, even for a non-beets-lover like myself. - Charred octopus was tender and fresh. - Branzino came with a very strong olive aroma(in a good way) and was topped by greens and onions- very good. - The highlight was carrot fries- absolutely loved those tempura-like carrots.

The whole experience was a joke.We made a reservation a few weeks in advance and were really excited, but I was extremely underwhelmed when I walked in. The restaurant was more than half-empty, so I guess we didn't really need a weeks-advance reservation. We sat outside because it was nice out, and I did enjoy the ambiance, but I felt like something was lacking. The place looks unfinished to me.Anyway, I decided to order Eggs Benedict because everything else was just a bit too pricey for me to justify spending on brunch. My other two friends ordered the Lobster Scramble which is basically just a scrambled omelet with lobster and créme fraiche. The food came out rather quickly and the servers were nice, but all of our first reactions were along the lines of: ""Damn.. that's it..?""The portions are almost unbelievably small. For $16 the Eggs Benedict was literally just that - two eggs benedict. And some ""salad"" garnish in the middle. Fine - but the lobster scramble looked like a damn appetizer! I get it, it's lobster, but at $22 everyone was just immensely disappointed. It didn't even look appetizing. The quality of the food is good, but not enough to justify the price. The Eggs Benedict tasted below average. Apparently the lobster scramble was good - but if you're going to be serving brunch (inherently two meals in one), the ""entrees"" really do need to include a little more.

It was a lot of parties of late 30's and up women, parties of older adults, and families with kids. The room was brightly lit. Feels like it would have been better for a place to take your parents or a client during the week. Also good to mention that Narc Cafe and Narcbar were full of a younger looking crowd so we kind of felt like we were missing out a bit! Those would have been a better fit for a weekend outing. But... the food was amazing!!! For an appetizer we got the rotisserie-crisped beets. They weren't as crispy as advertised but the flavor was delicious and balanced out by the cool creamed horseradish (horseradish flavor wasn't overwhelming). The bulgur salad also added a good texture. This was a good portion size and could have been shared between 3-4 people. For my main, I got the steamed bass. The bass was perfectly cooked and the curry sauce (which they add at the table) was not too overwhelmingly ""curry flavored"". They give you bread to start so I was able to dip this in the curry sauce at the end. My friend go the charred short ribs which she also said was amazing. There wasn't a bite left on our plates!

For starters we, of course, got the cinnamon buns which comes as a tray of six and topped with a cream cheese dressing.  These were just.... delicious.  They come out warm and gooey and are a very manageable size for two people.  We didn't want them to end.  We did entertain the idea of getting the French toast bites as well but didn't want to totally ruin our appetites.  In retrospect, we probably could have splurged to do both the cinnamon buns and French toast bites and still had enough room to force down a main.  They looked delicious from what we could tell.For my main, I had the mushroom frittata which was similarly delicious and filling.  It is filled with mushroom (surprise!), sweet potato, and chard.  Heads up, it is served topped with sour cream (which is not noted in the menu).  So, if you're like me and despise sour cream with a passion, be sure to ask for it without.  My friend had the eggs Benedict which comes with two eggs and what she described as the tastiest ham she has ever had.On our walk out, my friend made a dinner reservation for when she has more friends visiting.  It was that good.",0,0,0,Jeffrey R.,"Washington, DC",7,140,324

She disappear for long stretches, barely knew the menu, and couldn't deal with any of the issues we had during the meal.Good segue...the food. None of it was good. Most of the food was cold or not seasoned, very bland. When we brought it to the attention of our server, she said the manager would remove the food from our bill - however no offer of a new dish was made. we came there to eat, not successfully send food back! On top of that, the manager didn't visit our table once, despite needing to send half of our food back.Plus, the spot next store - The Cafe - was having a viewing party of some sorts...we were hearing their music over our conversation.Complete waste of a dining experience.",3,1,0,Lee F.,"Manhattan, NY",54,40,0

One of the folks at our table had a lot of food allergies (dairy, gluten, onion/garlic...) Our waiter knew what was in each dish well enough to steer him towards options that work and how to tweak them to fit his dietary restrictions. Service continued to be attentive and professional throughout the meal. Very impressed. The food was awesome too! I had duck breast that was prepared very well. Not too much fat, crispy skin and a nice flavor. My wife said her scallops were prepared perfectly.  Our meal ran long (5 talkative people) and we did not feel rushed.  Will definitely be back and highly recommend.",0,0,0,Scott A.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,132,1

2.0,3/2/2018,"Came here not too long ago for my birthday, and I was would give the entire experience one more star based on the food and the ambiance of the restaurant, but the service brought it down way low.We came in and were greeted nicely enough by the hostess and host. My boyfriend had told me he called once and spoke with a lady who was very accommodating and told us she could reserve a corner table for us (as we were celebrating an occasion). We were pretty excited seeing the beautiful restaurant and looking at the menu before. The host announced we'd be for table number 51, and walked us two feet toward a two-seater table on the right-hand side of the restaurant, squeezed in between one corner table and another miserable looking couple.  My boyfriend talked with the host about the arrangements, and they *decided* to be accommodating about it to take us to one of the four-seater corner tables by the windows, where ironically, three other couples were seated. They were DEFINITELY not happy about it, which made us super confused, and a little put off by the whole ordeal. We had specifically asked nicely way before our reservation date, and we saw plenty of other couples enjoying it--we were dressed well to celebrate; just felt like we were being jipped.We came to the table, were given our menus without much of a glance except a quick question about tap water, wine, etc. We decided to go for the Brunello di Montalcino 2006, which was brought out by the lovely sommelier (who was honestly the only person in the entire restaurant who gave us a smile).All in all, I would never come here again - especially for the price of our meal and the service we received.",0,0,0,Cathleen K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0
3.0,2/18/2018,"Food 3/5. Ambiance 4/5. Service 4/5. Coffee 2/5. I got the mushroom frittata and while it was filling and was strong in presentation, it was lacking in taste. I must have added a cup of black pepper to give it a semblance of flavor. If they added more sweet potato, that may do the trick. It also came with a huge glop of white gooey cream in the middle that I had to remove because who wants that? The coffee was absolutely horrible. It was watery and barely tasted like coffee, and the almond milk I got with it had this waxy substance in it that was such a turnoff. Couldn't finish my cup. The place is beautiful and a pleasure to sit in. The yellow walls and lamps, the huge windows letting in sunlight, and the modern décor create an ambiance perfect for brunch. Also really quiet, which makes it perfect for conversation. Sat at the bar, and the bartender took care of us in terms of water and ordering.

I made the reservation ~2 weeks in advance, and actually couldn't change the timing the day of so it was likely booked up by then.My friend and I ordered the grilled octopus, carrots wellington, and steamed bass. Although I'm not typically a fan of eggplant, the grilled octopus had eggplants along with tomato chunks (hence eggplant Zaalouk) which was very tasty. The crispy chickpeas that came with the dish were an awesome crunch and contrast in texture. Both the carrots wellington and steamed bass were also quite good. The carrots wellington, a vegetarian take on the beef wellington, had a deliciously buttery crust that I wanted more of. The steamed bass was nicely cooked and made with a french curry with rich flavours.Great meal!",0,0,0,Lillian Z.,"New York, NY",814,173,56
4.0,1/17/2018,"I dined at Narcissa twice in 5 days and 1/14 was my second time.  I think I would have rated everything with 5-stars if it was solely based on my first dining experience there 1/10.  If it were an option, I would give an overall 4.5 stars.(1/10) My daughter and I dined at Narcissa upon the recommendation of the front desk gentleman at the Standard upon check-in.  He said it would be perfect for us because I am vegan and my daughter is not.  My daughter had the duck, which she swears was the tastiest duck dish ever.  She said that it was not gamey at all and the texture of the crispy skin vs the buttery meat was absolutely incredible.  They replaced a sea bass dish with cauliflower for me and I ordered the kale as my side and although tasty, I enjoyed our bread and appetizers much more.  We ordered the trumpet mushroom (vegan sauce), roasted-charred beets and the chef sent us the Narcissa salad on the house because it took a while for the food to come out.  The meal and service this evening were perfect.(1/14)  We were so thrilled about our meal at Narcissa that even though we were now at a different hotel midtown, we wanted to bring the rest of our family to enjoy all the goodness.  We ordered the exact same items from 1/10 minus the kale and added the seafood minestrone and scallops for main and carrot fries for sides.  The bread that we raved about was cold and the crust wasn't crunchy like our last meal.  The duck was a disappointment this evening for the family.  They said that it could have been cooked just a tad longer.  The beets were not as flavorful but still good.   Carrot fries were on the colder side and a little less eventful than expected.  My husband said his seafood minestrone was very good but that's all I got from him.  I think the problem was that we had such an incredible, palate-stimulating experience the first time, the second time just paled in comparison.  I also wonder if a different staff worked on our food the 2nd night.  Service, starting with the host to our wait staff to the chef were all FANTASTIC.  In all fairness, we all still enjoyed the meal and I talked about Narcissa to everyone we met up with throughout our trip.  It's a fantastic restaurant and I would definitely recommend Narcissa, especially if you have a mix of diners with various dietary restrictions.",5,1,0,Christine L.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",96,15,1

4.0,12/9/2017,"One of my fav low key brunch spots in the city, and my go-to for catching up with old friends. Quiet, cozy (especially on this snowy morning in December), and easy to make resis (underrated in this city - we made the resi for 2 this week but honestly probably could have been seated without a wait even absent a resi). In terms of food, nothing on the menu is going to blow you away, but it's solid brunch stuff, so you won't be disappointed either. I usually just get eggs Benedict and coffee (free refills), but the biscuit and gravy isn't bad either if you're down for something a tad heartier/heavier, and the new newer poached eggs dish (wasn't there a couple years ago) is decent too.",0,0,0,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",279,214,551
4.0,12/4/2017,"I'm sorry, Narcissa. This really where half-star ratings would come in handy. This was a 4.5-star experience and I feel badly for going with four, but I can't totally justify five. Our experience here was lovely, from the seriously top-notch service to the well-curated, well-executed food menu. Though Narcissa has only been around for about three years or so, you can tell it has become pretty established at this point. The dishes that brought acclaim to Narcissa initially are still the shining stars of the menu, refined and perfected at this point. Fresh, farm-chic flavor profiles and lots of variety overall. This is not just another hotel restaurant. I'm sure it gets some extra business considering its partnership with the Standard, but I have no doubt it would survive (and much more) without the name drop. If you're looking for a moderately healthy restaurant to take your parents or significant other to and don't mind spending a bit of extra dough, Narcissa should be high up on your list. The bf and I came here at around 8pm on a Saturday night. Prime time. When I checked Saturday morning, I didn't see any reservations available, so I called ahead to see what the outlook was for the night. I spoke to Rodalfo, one of the hosts, who went above and beyond for us as the night went on. Initially, there weren't any tables available until 10pm, and we were hoping to eat earlier. I wanted to check out Narcbar as well, so he told us to check in with him ASAP, chill at Narcbar (right next door), and he'd try his very best to fit us in if anyone cancelled/no-showed. Once we arrived, he told us to pop in every 15 minutes for updates. About five minutes after ordering our second drink, our knight in shining armor sprinted into Narcbar, shouted my name to tell me that a table was free, and we were in business. He deserves lots and lots of praise (and tips). If it hadn't been for Rodalfo, we wouldn't have even made the trek down to the East Village. So THANK YOU!Upon sitting down, we were starving. It was around 9pm, and I had stupidly not eaten anything all day. Gotta keep plenty of room for the good stuff, though. Commitment. The space itself is beautiful. Warm and welcoming, intimate and loving but not romantic. Bright interior, modern decor. Open space, feels very positive in there overall. If our savior, Rodalfo, wasn't enough, the vibes inside had us in very good spirits even before scanning through the menu. As I mentioned, the menu at Narcissa is varied and pretty much everything has some serious tenure here. Lots of veggies, great assortment of apps and mastery over whatever protein you could want--fabulous seafood preparations, solid poultry and meat. They've got it all here. After order a glass of wine each, we went in for our selection. Sharing everything, as usual. Our eats, below: Rotisserie-Crisped Beets w/ bulgur salad, apples, creamed horseradish: A+ There's a reason these beets are famous. Perfectly crisped, immensely flavorful. Probably one of the best beets preparations I've ever had. Horseradish puree and shaved horseradish on top made for an incredible flavor/texture profile. I don't think these will necessarily satisfy your craving for rotisserie chicken but they might just change what your preferences are completely.  Broccoli & Ricotta w/ prosciutto and greens: A-Hard to follow the beets, but these were tasty too. The menu title was a bit misleading--there was probably more prosciutto than broccoli--but all components were well-done and the plate itself was beautiful. Nice earthiness from the broccoli, salt from the prosciutto and the light/fluffy/sweetness coming from the ricotta made for a lovely bite.Steamed Bass w/ french curry, lentils, watermelon radish, toasted almonds: A+Usually I'm a sauce on the side kind of girl but this French curry looked too good not to have spread generously over that bass. If that sounds sexual, oh well, because it was a sensuous experience. Incredibly preparation, both in presentation and in flavors. Everything blended together wonderfully and unsurprisingly the fish was cooked to perfection. Long Island Duck Breast, honey lacquered, smoked rutabaga, swiss chard: A++This plate and beets were the two jaw-droppers, with the bass close behind. I love duck and order it often--this was undoubtably one of the best preparations I've had. The skin was crispy, the flavors were unreal overall. Served medium rare and I wouldn't have asked for it any other way. Whatever goes on in that *honey-lacquering* process must have some Potter-level magic involved. Dark leafy greens and turnips for the starch lightened the dish up the bit and were worthy accompaniments.  Carrots Fries: A-/AA signature dish here so our expectations were high. Kinda like veggie tempura but still yummy. They plugged these enough that we opted for them instead of one of the raw dishes, which I kind of regret. But they were still solid. Not ground-breaking, though.",6,1,4,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,464,1480

She said yes, I could swap in the carrots Wellington. Perfect. She came back and said that was no longer an option so she'd give me what she described as another vegetarian entree (roasted cauliflower with a curry sauce and vegetables). Perfect. Fast forward (2 hours later) when we get our entrees. My friends got the sea bass and with their entree were roasted cauliflower with a curry sauce--meaning I just paid for the same for a plate of sides. Also, they weren't roasted, they were basically raw.

Came here for restaurant week and had a three course dinner for $42 (adding tax and tip, it came out to $52). Rotisserie-crisped beet: Pretty much just s gigantic beet dressed up with garnish and in a pool of green sauce. Even knowing this cost me a good buck, I did not manage to finish this dish. I love vegetables, but I'm just not crazy enough about beets to consume one the size of my face. Unless you want to eat a loooot of beet, go for another appetizer.Steak: Decently delicious! Juicy and tender, garnished with sheets of green onion. Pavlova: Definitely my favorite part of the meal. I don't even like meringue but I decided to try this one out, and it was great. A thin shell of white meringue with honey basil yogurt underneath, topped with strawberry slices. I really enjoyed the contrasting textures of the hard meringue that melted into sugar combined with the rich, smooth, tangy-sweetness of the yogurt, and the lovely bite of fructose from the berries at the end.Free bread (which I shall always review extensively and usually always positively, because free bread is my secret passion in life and my favorite part of all meals): This was some amazingly good bread.

We tried the halibut, duck, chicken, and steak, and let's just say it's not the best sign when no one at the table finished their plate.

2.0,6/11/2017,"Ok, we live not far away and have been to Narcissa 20 times in the past few years.  Let's talk about how it is going downhill.1.  To make a reservation, you now have to give a credit card.  Sorry, but you are not yet like Daniel or Per Se.  Please.  Once you give the reservation, if you wish to sit outside, then you go into the queue behind anyone who happens to walk off the street.  Your reservation is meaningless, and once you learn this, presumably you can forfeit the reservation and be charged, or sit around and wait like an idiot who never made a reservation in the first place.  This is new, and a really stupid idea.2.  The receptionist table at the restaurant reminds of Bill Belichick's phrase  ""Do Your Job.""  It does not take all 3 of you to spend 10 minutes chatting with the people who walked off the street about how long it will be til they get seated.  One person can do that, the others should take care of the people waiting in line.  With reservations, it took is 10 minutes to talk to anyone.3.  We reluctantly agree to wait to sit outside for brunch.  They take our number.  No one calls.  We check back an hour later.  ""Oh yes, there are two tables available outside.""  Thanks for calling.4.  The menu has gotten progressively worse.  No more oysters at brunch.  Too expensive to have a shucker around at the prices you charge?   Crabmeat scramble?  Had to be sent back once when there was no crabmeat at all.  Today, there was just enough (e.g., 3 tiny bites) so they couldn't be accused of forgetting it.  Please don't bother with this dish.  $23 for a whiff of crabmeat and two eggs is ridiculous.5.  No sense of timing whatever.  Our entrees came out 2 minutes after our appetizers.  Really?  You want to charge people's credit cards for a reservation and this is your level of service?  Laughable.  Note:  order appetizers separately and even if you know what you want, save your entree order for later or you will be trying to eat both together.6.  On the plus side, the Narcissa salad remains awesome, though the pistachios get scarcer and scarcer as time goes on.  The wine list is decent, though the French burgundies are ridiculously overpriced (I think there was a non-premier cru Mersault for $650, for example) - look for the values like Corsican vermentino and Italian fiano, little known wines where they won't try to gouge you.This is really a case study of poor restaurant management.  Horrendous front of the restaurant staff, absurd policies, designed to take advantage of rich out of towners.  I suppose there will always be people at the hotel who will eat there, so they think they can treat everyone poorly and provide little value.  But you are driving away people from the city.  We won't be coming back.",13,0,0,Mark M.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",8,17,1

4.0,5/24/2017,"I've had dinner here before and it's phenomenal. I'm writing this review, however, coming off of a great brunch. We had requested outdoor seating and much to our chagrin, it was reserved for a private party. Ultimately, it wasn't the nicest day of the year, otherwise I would've been supremely disappointed. The outdoor area is incredible and definitely worthy of placement atop various ""Best Outdoor Spaces in NYC"" lists and the like.None of this is to say the inside isn't a great place to dine. I'm not architecturally well-versed, so I don't know exactly how to describe the decor, but it felt like a very open space with a lively atmosphere, decently-sized tables, a pretty bar, and bathrooms that are a bit confusing (you'll see what I mean).Let me just say that I am a HUGE frittata fan. It's what I think of when someone uses the phrase ""f word"". If there is one on the menu, I'm most likely getting it, especially if the right veggies are mixed in. This was without a doubt the fluffiest frittata I've ever had...and fluffiness is undoubtedly one of the most important qualities a frittata can possess.To take a step back though, we started out with the french toast bites which are an absolute must. I think it's worth $7 for one little nibble, to be honest. They were perfectly cooked, rich with flavor, and beautifully complemented by the accompanying gooey maple syrup. My boyfriend went with the Duck Hash which I was a little envious of, though he's not one to watch his figure so it's easier for him to order things like that. It works out, though, because I get little bites of delicious dishes and he has to buy new bathing suits every summer. In all seriousness, the hash was fantastic. Let's be real here...how could it not be?They don't guarantee outdoor seating, but if I was rating Narcissa based on a meal in their garden on a bright Spring day, I'd be clicking that 5th star with all my might.",2,1,1,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,236,46
4.0,5/15/2017,"Somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars. It was a rainy Saturday around noon and we were in the area, so we took our chances and went in without a reservation. There were several tables available, so we were immediately seated. Initially, we were seated at a super cramped table wedged in between to other tables of two, but when we asked to switch to a four-top, they quickly agreed given that there were a couple of other four-tops open in case a larger group came.Our server was really pleasant. Very calm and very attentive. She was new, but when she didn't know the answer to a question, she found out immediately.We ordered the tomato benedict and the omelette. The tomato benedict came with sofrito kale, basil pesto, and scrambled eggs (per our request to deviate from the traditional poached). All topped with hollandaise sauce. There was toasted brioche bread on the side, so this was not a traditional open faced sandwich type of benedict. It was good, not great, but hearty and filling. Nothing special about the flavors, all just solid, but perhaps a bit under-seasoned. The omelette came with ramps, herbs, and what was described as a ""creamy wisconsin goat cheese,"" but the cheese didn't have the traditional goat cheese texture or taste. It essentially tasted like a mild-flavored hard cheese like gouda, which was disappointing because I wanted that tangy flavor that goat cheese has. And there was a lot of cheese making it heavier than you'd expect. But the texture of the omelette was one of the best I've had, especially given that it comes with only egg whites. It was thick, fluffy, and almost creamy. It didn't appear to come with any herbs as indicated, but I really didn't care. It was delicious.We ordered coffee, too, which I have to say was unusually bad. Very bitter tasting, despite our adding a lot of cream. And it's $4 for a regular coffee, albeit it comes with unlimited refills. All in all a cute place, very nice upscale-casual ambiance, comfortable, and it's a good safety to have, but it's nothing special and not worth seeking out.",0,0,0,Laura P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,342,0

We ordered 3 servings of this for the table and we all got SO SICK. It is apparent this was the secret killer as only 1 of 6 of us didn't eat it, and she was fine.

For dessert we selected the banana pudding with passion fruit caramel, topped with pineapples and coconut whipped cream (never heard of coconut whipped cream).

4.0,3/26/2017,"Very beautiful setting for a more casual night out. Expensive, but with a more casual setting. Came here with another couple to celebrate both of our anniversaries. I told the reservationist that we were celebrating and requested one of the booth tables (3 people sit in the booth, one person sits in a chair). We were led to the desired table which was great, but no one mentioned our anniversaries or provided any additional, special touch to the meal. This is why I wouldn't give it a full 5-stars. We started with the grilled octopus and tuna tartare which were both excellent. They provide ample bread as well, and we were offered 2 rounds of bread which was great. Both appetizers were fairly small, so I would suggest 1app/person, although can be pricey. We had the duck, the pork chop, and the scallops for entrees, and everyone seemed extremely happy and pleased with their meal! We were drinking the Sancerre which I would also recommend. For dessert, we shared the apple tart and he classic ice cream sundae. Both were delicious and not excessive.

4.0,3/20/2017,"Good food. Top notch ambiance. I'll be back but I'm in no rush. Narcissa is one of the nicest and most spacious NYC restaurants I've been to with very good food to boot. I had the Crab Soft Scramble and it was really great. It was light and delicious. Still, there was but one or two bites that were different than the rest, those with the morsels of filone. I thought adding more bread could be a way to enhance this dish. It got a bit monotonous and monotextured. It was a very good dish, but for $22, I expect a bit more detail and variety. Espresso was great as was my fizzy soda drink, the Orange-Ginger Seltzer. Props for having original virgin creations (I'm sober after waking up in a Williamsburg bodega basement in 2014). I was unimpressed by the starters. The cinnamon rolls weren't particularly soft and weren't interesting or unique. The carrot fries tasted bland, and the sauce was decent, but it couldn't save what basically seemed like carrot tempura with a spicy sauce. More sauces could help, or perhaps some seasoning on the fries themselves. Docking a star because food didn't go the extra mile and service was a bit strange. I could handle the slow pace for food, but for drinks, things were extra slow. Server was not on top of our coffee needs nor quick to refill waters. A final details I didn't like --when we split our bill, the gratuity percentage was of the total bill NOT the split.  Again, not really a huge thing, but for a $$$, I expect the carpet to match the drapes and for my receipt to not contain lies.

It tasted like Macy's work attire department - non-threatening, dull and memorably unmemorable. It actually tasted as if the tuna was frozen then thawed and served with some cream as an afterthought ('well we can't just serve the tuna by itself...')The entrees, my lamb shoulder and my friend's duck breast were not bad, but by then perhaps our frustration from the first half of the meal had leaked into the second and there was pretty much no turning back at this point.Waiters and staff were pretty nice, but that was all overshadowed by how impressively bland that tuna tartare was, so impressive I am motivated to write my first yelp review here.

From the bread, to the fried carrots and scallops we were blown away! But the piece de resistance of our experience has to be the Meuille feuille... Words cannot describe this.

The carrots had great flavor and the dipping sauce paired with it nicely.Dover sole (4 stars): We are both huge fans of dover sole and found this dish to be good. The flavor was there and the portion was a decent size and the potatoes and cucumbers were a nice addition as well.Duck (5 stars): Wow--this dish was very tasty and a great portion size as well. The combination of the duck (and skin) with the rhubarb was delicious--definitely a must order.Mille feuille (4 stars): After seeing pictures of this dessert, we had to give it a try. Though it was not the best dessert we have ever had, it definitely lived up to expectations. The dish itself was massive and the variety of flavors made for a nice bite.Overall, this place was a bit more low energy than we expected, but the food spoke for itself.

Creme sauce and bulgur sprinkle on top were perfect accompaniments.-Carrot fries: !!!! Deep fried, deliciously crunchy exterior and nice soft carrot inside. Spicy and served with yogurt dip. We devoured these.-Lobster brochette: the scallops were a bit overdone but the lobster and shrimp were wonderfully tender. Rice pilaf was toothsome and the tomatillos were intense.My dining companions enjoyed the salmon brochette and tenderloin mains.

The skin on the duck is perfectly cooked - It was sweet and savory and not overly fatty. The meat itself was cooked to perfection and literally melted in your mouth. Besides the duck the appetizers were delicious. I preferred the octopus appetizer over the fluke crudo - but both were delicious.

The waitress was very snobby and stuck-up, and was never around when you needed her during the meal. The food was overpriced, and portions were small. Dishes were hit or miss. I really liked the carrot fries, but we didn't get nearly enough of them (normally when you order fries as a side dish, it's a pretty sizable portion). The meat dishes - lamb, chicken, duck - were poorly seasoned and a bit overdone - they just weren't worth the $30+ per plate price tag.

4.0,12/8/2016,"I really liked this restaurant-- the food, hospitality, and setting were great.I sat on the side of the restaurant which was near the chefs- It was great being able to watch them prepare the food as we ate.Their seasonal menu has many offerings. However, the portions are small- even the entree. My favorite of the night was a celery root ravioli with squash and browned butter. It was quite tasty (especially with that brown butter) but I particularly wanted the dish for its squash which was only tiny bits 'sprinkled' on top of the ravioli.The carrot fries are literally fried carrots- too much fried batter for my liking. The dipping sauce that was paired with them was good though.The dining room is trendy, yet romantic. Dim lighting but not too dim.

The nenu is appealing  & innovation, the service polished, and the wine list diverse.VIBE: Intimate, largely due to the dim lighting (actually, the lighting is nicely done, with spotlights on each tabletop, but the lighting between tables and in passage areas is too dim for me). Décor (what I could see of it), is tasteful and casually elegant. Conversation friendly.SERVICE: Our server was cordial and helpful.GOOD: I enjoyed most everything, especially a beet salad, a brusels salad, an octopus appetizer, and beef tenderloin special.

3.0,11/17/2016,"3 stars. I've been here twice, the first time I remember really liking it, but unfortunately did not write a review at the time.  I just went back with a large group for a corporate event and found it did not live up to what I remembered. We had the private room in the back, which was very nice and secluded.  With the door closed, it was incredibly quiet in there, which was really nice to be able to hear each other speak.  Since it was a large group, everything was brought out family style. People got a mix of cocktails and bottles of wine. The service was very attentive and good during our meal, though one of my colleagues noted she never got her gluten free Kale.We received:Narcissa salad. This was delicious.  It had a mix of fruit (pears), different greens, lots of shredded gouda and pistachios.  The dressing was also very flavorful and they added the perfect amount.Stuffed Squash with Truffle.  This was very unique and tasty. Grilled stuffed squash with black truffle sprinkled on top, farro and leaks. And, they gave you plenty of truffle!For the mains, they brought the chicken and fish on a large board before taking it back into the kitchen to carve and serve family style.  This was a nice touch.Chicken.  Let's be honest, if I came by myself I would not have ordered the chicken, but alas it was family style.  It was pretty moist, and the skin was crispy.  But it's chicken after all and this isn't a known chicken restaurant.Grilled Turbot.  Was just OK.  It was cooked very well but was pretty bland and not flavorful.Sides. We had sides of cauliflower and spinach.  The cauliflower was cooked very well and was seasoned nicely.  The spinach had potato chips in it and was creamy delicious.For dessert we got the mille feuille, which was amazing. Basically tasted like a smores, with milk chocolate, salted caramel and malted cream.Overall, this is a nice place for a large group, though I would have preferred some meat instead of chicken and fish.

Excellent flavors and lots of cheese :) My sister got the veggie burger which was also delightful. My only complaint would be the bloody marys. Very watery, and lots of floating pepper/spices that tasted like I was slurping up pepper through a straw. And the spicy version just tasted like straight hot sauce!

5.0,10/30/2016,"I'm going to be honest. I've been going back and forth and about whether I wanted to write a review about Narcissa because I LOVE IT and I want it to be my go-to brunch spot so I don't want it to get any more crowded than brunches in New York need to be. After careful contemplation and wistful memories of the cappuccinos at Narcissa, I have selflessly decided that Narcissa is too good to not rave about. You're welcome internet.First of all, I love how Narcissa is split into two parts - the right side of the restaurant upon entering gives more of a classic American diner vibe, while the left side is more naturally lit, open air with a beautifully open kitchen area (P.S. I prefer the left side to be honest, but it's nice to have the option of a more intimate setting). Service: the service at Narcissa is great! There was no feeling of being rushed, the waiters and waitresses have been delightful and helpful with guiding us through the menu - and their recommendations have been on point. This is definitely a waitstaff that likes their own food and rightfully so - the food is amazing!Food: Unfortunately I have not yet been able to eat everything on this menu so I cannot speak to a few of the favourites here, but what I have had has been amazing so far. Let's start with the cappuccino because to be quite honest I like my coffee the way the Turkish do ""black as hell, and strong as death"" which is why I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this cappuccino and beautifully it was made. The milk was foamed just right and was so creamy that is just kind of melted into this strong but not bitter espresso.Entree-wise, I had the Duck Hash the first time I went and to be honest, I had to use all my willpower in the world not to order it again the second time around because - wow! That perfect ratio of the bright acidity coming from the chimmichurri with the heartiness of a hash and bits of duck thrown into it was beautiful. The dish came out filling, hearty but not in such a way that left me feeling heavy - portion was just right here. The second time around, I had an Egg White Omelet - which to be completely honest, was not as big of a winner for me as the Duck Hash, but that is not to say this dish was not amazing as well! The squash with the fragrance of the mushrooms and this beautiful caramelized onion inside this delightfully fluffy egg white omelet was just divine. And to brighten it up with some lightly dressed greens really left me feeling refreshed. This felt like a true farm to table dish but elevated in such a way that matched the effortless class of the restaurant itself.All in all, I'm kicking myself because I feel like I have shared too much. Save room for the dessert menu because I definitely did not - even on the second time around! I highly recommend Narcissa as one of New York's brunch destinations.",3,0,0,Kimberly C.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",234,128,333

She's been wanting to check this place out for a while and I resisted all along which has helped me surprise her nicely.I made a reservation with Open Table and left a note saying it was her birthday, so they sat us in the corner booth. It was empty at first but after the restaurant piled in, I realized they hooked us up.For starters, we had Narcissa's Salad and the Rock Shrimp Barley Risotto. The salad was surprising salty, I think mainly from the dressing and the cheese. What I think was the dried potato slices helped neutralize the saltiness but it was still pretty powerful. The risotto was good and different, and flavoring again was very strong although this time not necessarily salty.For mains, we ordered the cod and lamb chops. Whomever was in charge of seasoning in their kitchen had an uneven sprinkle but there were again many parts where the salt was way too overpowering, on both the lamb and fish. You could almost tell the great cooking hiding behind the salt but it was a bit too much for us to enjoy.We closed the meal with the Olive oil sundae which was as you could assume... salty! But this saltiness was definitely a good kind.The service at the restaurant was very pleasant and the waiter was very patient with us while we decided on our orders.

My egg white omelet was cooked slightly rare than I expected, however ended up with a perfect texture. The mushroom and marinated onion made it more flavorful. I also stole a bite from my friend, who ordered the crab scramble - liked the fact that every bite of the egg had a subtle taste of crab! I guess it was pretty hard to find things to complain at Narcissa; but the service was slightly on the slow end - we had to rush our waitress in order to get our dishes ordered...acceptable as it was a pretty crowded Sunday noon, yet I do hope it could get a bit more streamlined.Will be back for their dinner dishes for sure!",7,5,7,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633

1.0,8/19/2016,"I would like to start this with saying after my terrible experience at Narcissa Wednesday night I created this account to write my first and hopefully last review of a restaurant. Last night, I had my first dining experience at Narcissa to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend. Dinner started off great- we had a reservation and  the hostess seated us right away. The first waiter who came to our table was fantastic, friendly and attentive and happily took our order when we were ready.  Also throughout the meal staff was constantly coming by our table and refilling our wine glass, which was great. When the entrees were brought to the table we were introduced to a new waiter who was less than enthusiastic. We each ordered an entree to share. My boyfriend got the Sea Bass (which replaced the Red Snapper) and I ordered the Taco Farm Half Chicken. The fish was cooked extremely well but the cucumber gazpacho it came with was not appetizing- it was watered down. We didn't complain about this because we weren't sure if it was just our taste...As for the chicken, I instantly went in search of the mashed potatoes that come with dish- only to find there was enough for about 2 bites. I then tried the chicken breast and it was very dry- my boyfriend and I had two bites each of the breast and confirmed yes it was definitely overcooked, but it was already late so we decided it was best to just cut our losses and try to find some pieces that weren't overcooked which wasn't many. When we were done with our meal a majority of the chicken was still left on our plate, and I told the waiter that he should let the kitchen know that our chicken was overcooked. He did not care AT ALL that we were not pleased with the entree and just simply said okay, would you like it wrapped? And we said yes because it was $30 and we could try to make something out of the overcooked chicken at home. After that our service at Narcissa went south quickly, the staff stopped coming to table to fill our wine glasses. The hostess came once while our 2nd bottle was 3/4 of the way full filled our glasses and gave us a less then disapproving look literally making the two of us feel uncomfortable. Our waiter came to our table dropped the dessert menus in front of us and walked away with out saying a word.  We had to flag down the waitress to order dessert. The dessert came and we were not tended to again until we were done and our waiter cleared our plate asking if we wanted the bill- I wanted to leave 10% tip, but felt it was unfair to the waiter in the beginning who took all of our orders and was a pleasure to be around so we tipped 18%. We paid the manager grabbed our bill without saying anything to us.

I was sad to share because they were so decadent but you do get 6 small buns in an order so it was plenty for the 2 of us.  They were hot from the oven and the glaze was thick and a little citrusy.I had the Eggs Benedict with heirloom tomatoes and a side of bacon.  The eggs were poached well and the tomatoes were flavorful and matched with the hollandaise sauce well.  The bacon was solid but nothing special, though it was quite a large side, again perfect for 2!  I also had an iced latte which was well balanced and a good size.Our waitress was friendly though because of the layout of the dining room she wasn't always available.  The busboys were a little over eager about clearing our plates for my liking (don't touch my bacon!) so that was the only strong negative as multiple times we had to shoo them away and felt a bit rushed.",1,1,1,Jenn E.,"Seattle, WA",250,369,140

The appetizer was super duper delicious. It was mixed with something citrusy perhaps with lemon juice. The onion and roe was also dipped with this sauce and together with the scallops made the dish spectacular. The combination of all the flavors and texture in my mouth was such a blast! It was a bit pricey but I think it was worth it. The duck breast with cranberry sauce was pretty amazing as well. I'm not someone to order something sweet in my dinner dish, but since it was highly recommended by a friend I decided to give it a shot. The cranberry sauce was not too sweet, and tasted creamy when eaten with the duck breast. My friend also liked the Taco Farm Half Chicken - the meat was moist and tender and adding the mustard sauce was a job well done.We stayed here after dinner for a long time and the staff never rushed us to leave or anything like that.

2.0,6/19/2016,"I went to Narcissa with a few friends for brunch. The atmosphere fit our criteria: pleasant, brunchful, and classy enough that we could pretend that we were in an episode of ""Sex in the City"" (except that we'd all be Miranda because, let's not fool ourselves, Miranda was the only *real* character on that show). We had all planned on ordering mimosas, but immediately declined as soon as we saw the price. Disappointing! Unless mimosas are made from Dom Perignon and orange juice fresh-squeezed from an angel's armpit, there's no justification for such a cost. I did order a cup of tea, but the waitress forgot about it. As for the food, I ordered a very expensive waffle. It was small, and adequate as far as waffles go, but certainly not revelatory. Even if it had been, a small revelatory waffle should not cost that much. It came with a large pat of salty butter which was pretty tasty, a couple of berries, and a wee syrup pitcher that was about 1/8 full. You're not even going to present a *full* tiny syrup pitcher?Now, the important part, the only reason I bothered to write this review: THE BATHROOM. I'm surprised I haven't read about it in all other reviews of this establishment. Allow me to describe the surreal experience that was travelling to and using Narcissa's bathroom:You go through a plain, unassuming door. You now find yourself in a mysterious hallway lined by other doors, anonymous stylishly-dressed bodies bustling to and fro. Where to now, you ask? Through one of those doors. Whichever one leads to the rainbow mirror stairway, obviously.You descend the brightly colored steps, trying not to lose your footing as you become entranced by your reflection looming above you in the mirrored ceiling. Your sense of time and space begins to dull. The soundtrack to Mario Kart's ""Rainbow Road"" starts playing in your head, and you hope you don't get hit by a red shell and careen off the path. You forget which is real: the you on the stairs, or the upside-down you on the ceiling. Who am I, you ask yourself? Where am I going? Now you're on level ground once more, in another dimly-lit hallway. Ahead lies a mysterious path. To your left, an alcove of some sort perhaps? No, it's an entryway area, featuring naught but a large photo booth. So far, in this choose-your-own-adventure, you have chosen wisely. You don't know it yet, but you're close to your destination. So close.The entryway opens up to a long hallway lined completely with tall wooden panels. But wait--they aren't panels! They're more doors. Doors without clear handles or even slight gaps between or beneath them. You wonder, is this the bathroom? Are these stalls? Where are the sinks? Am I on planet earth? Somebody please send help?? ALL I WANTED WAS TO POOP OUT MY TINY EXPENSIVE WAFFLE.A door enters. You see a toilet. Your feet instinctively propel you towards it. You close the door. This is not just a bathroom stall. Oh no. This is an entire tiny bathroom, all for you. Most of the walls are papered in bright patterns. An oddly-proportioned sink is positioned near the toilet, as well as mirrors, some angled to allow you to watch yourself poop. You didn't ask for this life, but here you are, in this little, dim bathroom booth, watching yourself poop. This is your life now.But your journey has come to an end. You flush, wash and dry your hands, and exit your bathroom booth. Looking around at either end of this long hallway of doors, you realize that it's bordered by giant panels of white light. Or are they tunnels of light, waiting to transport you to the afterlife? Perhaps you were dead all along. Perhaps this is purgatory, or this journey was a modern, unguided tour through the New York equivalent of the river Styx. Where you go from here is up to you. Do you go towards the light? Do you dare confront the Rainbow Mirror Steps once more? Does death taste like a mediocre $14 waffle? I leave you with these questions, dear reader, so that you may find the answers for yourself.",1,1,1,Julia G.,"Cambridge, MA",0,1,0

4.0,5/20/2016,"Went for a very early dinner so place was quite empty when we walked in but packed by the time we left. the food and service were excellent and they have a pretty impressive wine list. The appetizer and entrée portions were definitely on the small side so you'll probably still be hungry unless you order more than one entrée and an app (per person). Downside: Our waitress wasn't very generous with her wine pourings. I ordered a second glass of wine, and my glass was still a quarter full, and she filled it exactly till where it was the first time which was pretty annoying since their wines are pricey and she could clearly see my glass was a quarter full when she poured me my second glass. I should have said something but didn't. Pros: The food itself was excellent and the space and ambience were perfect.

2.0,5/8/2016,"I had heard this place was amazing when it first opened and that it had gone down since then. Being that my first time was just recently, I was disappointed with the food that was served to me at lunch. The famed carrot fries are drastically different now than the other beautiful photos on Yelp- they were covered in batter and the plate contained 5 greasy little fries for $7, not that I would wanted more of them anyway- whatever they've changed to the preparation, they should go back! Cheeseburger was ok, not bad; my friend felt ill after eating the veggie lasagna (said it was too greasy which I can attest to seeing the layer of oil on the top and sides). The salads looked more promising on the menu and maybe we should have just had those. The money we paid didn't warrant the quality of the meal we had. It's too bad that the food was just ok, because the space is very interesting, a real gem in the neighborhood. The dining area by the bar is much cuter and romantic than the front room- request to be seated there if you are on a date.

DUCK LEG SCHNITZEL - I've never had schnitzel before and probably won't ever again.  It's meat that is beaten down to a thin slice and then fried.  What a waste of duck.The rest:BROCCOLI & BACON FRITTATA - Nothing specialTACO FARM HALF CHICKEN - Moist and flavorfulBISCUIT with lavender-honey butter - The best thing we ordered.  The biscuit was light and flaky, while the butter really does have lavender-honey flavor to it.",3,2,1,Elle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",208,285,372
2.0,3/29/2016,"The service was really, really bad. Our waiter was sick and sniffling the whole time, seemed to forget what we order multiple times, and only came to the table twice throughout the whole 1.5 hours that we were sitting down. Any time we needed a refill on coffee or water, we had to flag someone down because he was nowhere in sight. And when we did ask someone to bring it over, they forgot so we had to ask yet another person for help. The food was pretty good but the cinnamon buns were cold...When were ready to pay, the system crashed and nobody let us know what the hold up was until I approached the hostess stand after 15 minutes of waiting for someone to return to our table with the credit card. They then told us that it would be just a bit of a wait as they wait for the system to reboot... which took another 10 minutes. When I asked again when it'd be ready (we were in a hurry to get out of the restaurant to get my dad to the airport), they said they were going to have to do it manually because the system completely crashed.  Now, I understand that the system crashing is not in any way predictable and I don't blame the restaurant for that but the manner in which this is communicated to the customer and alleviated should be of the utmost importance. They failed on both of these fronts.I won't be returning here which is really unfortunate because I live right around the corner and if I'd had a better experience I likely would've made this a regular spot.

Here's what we got and what I'd recommend:- carrot fries - I personally didn't love them as much but the breading and frying on them is so crispy and delicious. It's hard to salt the inside of a carrot, but that's what I felt was missing. - burrata - I love burratas so I'm biased but I loved this one. Also a nice plus was the mushrooms surrounding the dish - so good!- baked orata - the fish is so beautifully flaky and delicious - the bed of onions it is on is also nicely seasoned and pickled. It's a fishy fish (which I love) so look out for that. - burger - this item here was so good it was NASTY, ugh, so delicious. You HAVE to get it when you're here!Desserts - - carrot cake - really quite good but the star is...- olive oil ice cream with lemon curd and pistachio biscotti - this is one of those desserts that mixes together so well so definitely taste the pieces together separately but it's so much better all together!  Great place to go - highly recommended!",2,0,0,Monica Q.,"Seattle, WA",111,753,125

5.0,2/4/2016,"Such a lovely farm-to-table restaurant in NYC! The whole experience is amazing and hearty. (Easily one of best duck I had).The visit being so unique is because their whole idea of farm-to-table, nature and balance is expressed in every way from all the decoration serials, to the tasty seasonal menu, to the lovely outdoor garden, to the friendly staff....We ordered Branzino and the famous duck as main dishes, carrot fries as side, and choco smore as dessert. We found a lot of carrots on their menu, so we decided to go with carrot fries. I am big fan of sweet potato fries. These carrot fries even beat my expectation on good sweet potato fries! They are healthier, also crispy, sweet but tastier with the seasonings added to the flour coat. Now, I get to talk about the duck! Crispy outside, tender and juicy inside! Together with the little sour sauce and radish side, it's not overwhelming as duck always comes with a lot of fat under the skin nor the dry meat because of the need to heat the fat out from the skin. Branzino is also well flavored and taken out of the bones. We also enjoyed the warm choco smore.Overall, it was a great experience not limited to food itself (every dish was tasty, healthy and thoughtfully balanced), but also the life-style concept.

I had the day boat scallops with cauliflower as my main course which were plump and delicious and the husband had the braised short rib with parsnip apple puree and cranberries which was also really good. Prices are on the higher side (both mains were $34) but it's not terrible if you want to spend a special evening. We had the deconstructed cheesecake for dessert and I really liked it. We usually go for something chocolaty but they didn't have anything that seem to fit the bill. Service was good albeit a bit spotty at times. At one point my husband gave me a card ( it was my bday) and as I was unfolding it the manager placed a pen in front of me saying that it looked like I needed one.

Oh, and we also ordered their infamous carrot fries. All in all, the meal was really good and was really delicious.

The carrot was soft in the inside and the corresponding sauce had a really nice kick to it (jalapeno tofu dip)Rotisserie crisped beets: Okay, not what I was expecting because the beets were not ""crisped."" Nevertheless, it tasted hearty and meaty (like a rotisserie chicken). The salad on the bottom was more like a dip and its creamy texture was a good pairing with the beets.Celery root cake: a light dessert to end the meal. Great flavors and would reorder again.I noticed that they had an open kitchen on the other side of the restaurant from where I was sitting and hopefully on my next visit, I would get to sit there.

3.0,1/18/2016,"This meal started off promising and declined slightly towards the end.My wife and I walked in at 2 pm on a Sunday and were promptly seated. I was craving either some pancakes or steak and eggs. I went with the latter, and my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with a selection of either French Toast bites for $7, an assortment of doughnuts for $10, or Iced Cinnamon Buns for $10. We went with the buns.The cinnamon buns were great, and even better paired with my coffee. We ate half and I looked forward to taking the other half home to enjoy at a later time.The steak and eggs came out and looked really promising. The texture, cut and tenderness of the steak was perfect. However, after my first bite, I slowly realized that it was the saltiest bite of steak I had ever eaten. I don't know what or why, but not only was there a massive amount of oil and seasoning on it, they had also seared the edge with something salty (I'm guessing salt). I ended up trying to press the steak against my plate to squeeze out some of the oil, but each bite got increasingly salty. The texture and taste of the steak was amazing, but that saltiness was too much. I've never left a steak I've ordered uneaten, but I couldn't finish the last bite of steak, even though I was still hungry. I must have downed 4 glasses of water before I called it quits. Coffee couldn't cut through that salt either.At the end of our meal, we asked the waiter to box up our cinnamon buns to go, and he came back with a coat check ticket saying we could pick up our cinnamon buns at the front before we left. The service was friendly, and we paid and left. Yes we left. Sadly, forgetting that I had my delicious cinnamon buns waiting for me at coat check. As we got off the subway on our way home, my wife remembered the buns, and I stood there for a second, wondering if I should make the 15 minute trek back on the subway to get half of a $10 iced cinnamon buns. It was so sad. I didn't go back. After lamenting the fact that they didn't give us a doggy bag at the table, we spent the next 20 minutes talking about how good the buns would have been at home.

4.0,1/5/2016,"What a beautiful restaurant! It's the gems like these that truly make you appreciate the food and environment of New York. Beautiful interior, love the open kitchen and the front patio, and obsessed with the adorable alleyway-style entrance. The location is also prime since it is not an area you'll get pummeled over in a crowd of tourists, but still feel the presence of New York all around.Food: I got the duck breast and was surprised twice. One, by the size of the portion, and two, by the tenderness of the whole thing. Usually duck breast portions are not very large, but not here! Also, the meat was so tender and not as fatty as you would imagine with the portion. I was so satisfied with this dish. I would want to come back just for this entree. Cocktails; all the cocktails I tried here was great. The one I got was the hot ginger drink (too lazy to look up the name). It was amazing. I love hot cocktails because you get to sip on it for a longer time, and the intense ginger taste kind of forced you to take it slow too. Service: thank you for taking reservations. Really. And thank you for coat check too. Really friendly waiters and waitresses, but maybe, just maybe a little TOO eager to help? This is what I mean. I love listening to specials and food descriptions, but there is a line of what is too much. We had two different waiters come and explain same items on the menu, saying the same jokes about how taco is the name of the farm, etc. we obviously didn't interrupt the second waitress that  started saying the same things since that seemed rude, but you could see the smiles in our table dwindle and hands fidgeting around our sleeves since these descriptions were soooo longggggg. I really don't think it is necessary to explain at least 2 items in appetizers, entrees, desserts, EACH. also, our table was laughing and enjoying our drinks, fully absorbed into our conversations, and the waitress literally interrupts and describes the desserts, ingredients, presentation, and the inventor of the desserts, and etc on and on. Kind of killed the mood.All in all, great vibe, great food, but a little too eager to impress with the service.",3,0,2,Jessica L.,"Boston, MA",323,131,108

4.0,12/23/2015,"My friend took me here for birthday dinner and it was so lovely! Service was on point- we were given a corner table (I love corner tables, if you couldn't tell from my previous posts lol) and exceptional servers who knew we were celebrating a special occasion. It was quite apparent that they went out of their way to make sure everything ran smoothly! No pretentiousness. We started off with the Fluke and Gnocci- both are seriously great choices. Believe the hype and get the carrot fries too! Strong start to our meal. I ordered the Scallops, and he had the Duck Breast. Both were great. Highly recommend if you're sharing to opt for a light entree and a heavier entree. Dessert was a bit underwhelming though: We shared the broken cheesecake but I found it too sweet and overly citrusy. I'll be back for their appetizers and entrees. (and def for their carrot fries! lol) Perhaps I'll give their dessert another shot or head somewhere else after our meal.

4.0,12/19/2015,"We came here after a 3 hour lunch at Casa Mono, and we really only wanted dessert. But of course being the bon vivants we are, we ended up having a full meal:The dining room is really beautiful. Just large enough so that tables are spaced appropriately apart but also small enough that you won't feel like you're in a huge banquet hall. Service here is wonderful, too. You'll never catch staff running around or cutting guests off (my pet peeve). Smiles everywhere. Those green dresses that female servers wear are super cute and I would definitely wear them to work... The maitre d is super classy  (and a hot piece!) but not snobby at all (which can sometimes happen in stores of this level). He didn't have a table for us at the time since we walked in, but graciously gave us two seats at the pastry bar which was great since my friend and I both worked in the industry and got to chat about techniques and ingredients with one of the pastry cooks. The wine list is interesting enough to satisfy adventurous drinkers but also familiar enough to keep those who just want a safe bottle to enjoy with dinner. I wish there were just a few more wine by the glass options but in being a restaurant famous for seasonality I'm sure these change often as well. The carrots Wellington truly are a highlight here, probably why it's been a mainstay on their menu! The pastry is perfectly flaky and crisp and the carrots buttery. Really satisfying dish that also happens to be veg friendly! Unless you've had it before you're doing yourselves no favors by skipping it. Bread service is also quite good. No soft Parker rolls or store-bought crackers here- just crusty rolls that are perfect for scooping up the last dribbles of sauce and scraps of meat and fat on your plate. Ahh. A good place to break the news to the fam that you are now engaged, pregnant or the victor of some lofty humanitarian award.

4.0,11/15/2015,"There are a lot of vegetable-forward restaurants in NYC now and, with almost 2 years under its belt, I can safely say this is truly one of the best.Narcissa was so trendy in 2014 and now, in the first moments of winter 2015, it is just a straight up established restaurant that everybody in the scene really respects and admires.Dishes like the carrots wellington, branzino, carrot fries, and various sundaes are beloved NYC dishes now and you still get a crazy number of carnivores coming here for really elegant meat preparations (lamb/pork).I don't really know why I am giving 4 stars. Some elements are just a little rich and off the deep end for me, as if Fraser knows the food is largely vegetarian and wants to apologize for it. This means the barley rissotto is a little too cheesy/buttery, the sizable smores tart has a solid inch of chocolate ganache at its center and way too much meringue.But whatever, the service here is absolutely outstanding (special props to the amazing bartenders) and dishes like the branzino and carrots wellington are showstoppers.

1.0,11/13/2015,"If I could give this place a zero, I would. There was not one redeeming thing about this place. Let's start from the beginning.(1) Hostesses were extremely rude when they were greeting us and were stand-off-ish.(2) Our waiter did not come to our table until 15-20 minutes after we were seated(3) It took our waiter 35 minutes just to get us waters.(4) Our drinks (hot tea and a spritzer they had made on hand) took another hour.(5) Our food took over an hour to come out (just a frittata, omelette, and sides of ham and sausages). The sausages and ham were cold. I had ordered the omelette without cheese and they put cheese on it. I ordered the salad with dressing on the side and the dressing was mixed in. When I politiely informed them that the omelette had cheese in it, they didn't even bother to check and just said they told the chef the order without the cheese and so there's no way he could've gotten it wrong. When I showed them the cheese, they finally had it remade.(6) It took us less than 10-15 minutes to consume our meal but the whole experience took us 3 hours because we spent all of our time waiting. The waiter did not seem apologetic at all. And the restaurant wasn't busy AT ALL so I wonder how long it would take if it was busy.(7) The food is EXTREMELY underwhelming so the bad service wasn't even worth the food.",2,2,1,Ellen P.,"San Diego, CA",60,145,196

The dinner food is excellent. the brunch is so-so, the brunch menu could use some more variety. the dinner menu has kept me coming back here but why i'm only giving a 3 star rating is because the service is really consistently poor. it's not that this place lacks waiters, they just seem very disorganized. ie. we ask someone for water, no one comes, we ask again then 10 mins later we get water. the table next to use ordered dessert and then the bill came without their dessert arriving. we also had to wait about 20 mins until a waiter came to take our order. it seems like this is a simple fix since there is obviously headcount to help with better service, and I keep hoping each time I return that there will be improvement but unfortunately after 3 times of coming here it's been poor.",0,0,0,Anon 7.,"Manhattan, NY",4,61,0

The outdoor seating area looked lovely, but our table inside by the open kitchen was nice as well. Warm lighting and lots of sleek wood to set the ambiance for the trendy farm-to-table concept. We shared the tomato salad (a special), the beets, and the pork belly as apps, and a side of the carrot fries. The veggies are definitely highlighted at Narcissa. Everything was yummy (well would probably pass on the tomatoes again), but the real star for me was the duck! Soooo good, skin was perfectly crispy and meat was tender and juicy.

The waffle was barely warm and the butter accompanying it never melted.The server was lovely and attentive but I would have liked for her to be observant to the fact that something was wrong with the food. The steak and eggs for 35 dollars should have been perfection and it just wasn't - the salsa verde was over powering and should have been on the side.In all - it feels like we paid for hype and the potential celebrity spotting and we didn't even get that :(,1,0,0,Jana H.,"Miami, FL",21,49,15

It kept on magically being refilled.  Started off with vegan cesear (so flavorful, airy but surprisingly substantial) and octopus. Octopus was good texture but seemed bit over salted.  Also ordered carrot fries. If you love tempura you'll love this.  Delicious! and so phallic lol. Mains were ribeye and sea bass.  Ribeye was perfectly cooked.  Sea bass was one of the most unique dishes I've ever had. Served with a coconut curry, pickled match sticks of some veggie, dried apricot pieces, over lentils with hints of mustard and toasted almonds.  Interesting and delicious dining experience.  I am lactose intolerant and couldn't have any of the desserts so they put together a trio of sorbets (red current, pineapple orange and watermelon) with baby merengue chips.  The pineapple orange was the best.  I'd definitely go back.",0,0,0,Jen C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,34,1
4.0,9/12/2015,"I had a wonderful dinner here last night with my girlfriends for my early birthday celebration ! Our reservation was for 6:30pm and a few of them were running late but the host was super accommodating and let us get seated first. Everyone was present by 6:50 with a glass of refreshing Summer in the City in hand.Narcissa is absolutely gorgeous, so modern and sleek. The lighting is soft and warm, perfect ambiance for any special occasion and great for food photos, heh. There are two separate dining areas but we were seated in a booth close to the open kitchen.Tonight we started with the barley risotto, charred octopus and potato gnocchi. The highlight for me was definitely the barley risotto. We almost didn't order this but so glad we decided to add it. Perfectly cooked pearls of tender, carby goodness. Who knew barley could taste so good? There was so much flavor from the clams and leeks. The charred octopus and potato gnocchi was not as memorable. The octopus was a bit overcooked but the accompanying eggplant zaalouk and chickpeas was delicious. The potato gnocchi didn't hold it's form too well. It was too mushy and bland.For entrees, our amazing waiter sold us on the rotisserie chicken special for two, mentioning that it has been a special for about 6 months due to it's popularity. We also had the seed crusted skate and taco farm pig(pork chop). All the entrees were outstanding and showcased such clean flavors. At $72, that chicken was the most expensive I've ever had but it was damn good! Incredibly tender and juicy, just like the pork chop, and both were accompanied with the most delightful veggies right from the farm of one of the owners. You can definitely taste the difference.It was my first time trying skate but I am a total fan. The breading on the fillets were perfectly seasoned and light and the fish itself was moist and succulent. We ended our dinner with the sake poached white peach. Such a pretty looking dessert but not as tasty as I'd hoped. The peach wasn't as sweet as I'd liked but poached perfectly and not bad with the fresh cream. I enjoyed the accompanying nutty, crunchy sesame nougatine. 4 stars for food and ambiance and 5 stars for service. Our waiter was one of the best, ever.

3.0,9/11/2015,"Folks, first things first, my heart goes out to the dessert chef. Her honey lemon cheese cake was absolutely wonderful, deserving five stars. but this a restaurant review, what can I do.We tried bunch of things, they all sound very interesting on the menu but overall the aromas hang in the air without melting into a flavor profile. Let me say this outright, though. Despite my weak review, I will come back to this restaurant, because there is a lot of effort and thought going into the dishes despite the lack of flavor and excitement. The dude is definitely trying hard.RAW TUNA cucumber-basil water, celery, jalapeño relish: cucumber is a heavenly aromatic in general, but this was a very weak dish, nothing that elevates the dish, quite boring.CRAB TOAST brioche, blueberries, jersey corn: That was a cheap trick with a sweet blueberry relish, no crab flavor, lotsa mayonnaise.CHARRED OCTOPUS eggplant zaalouk, chickpeas, farm greens: A chickpea dish with eggplant and thick tomato paste base, topped with octopus. The aromas of the spices with the chickpeas were really hanging in the air. any ordinary indian joint offers more complex chickpea dishes even if they don't call it zaalouk. The octopus was cooked perfectly though.STEAMED BLACK SEA BASS french curry broth, lentils, toasted almonds: Again the same problem, get some coconut milk, put some curry in it, that does not make a good sauce. The curry aroma was just hanging in the air without blending into the flavor.Two noteworthy dishes:ROTISSERIE-CRISPED BEETS bulgur salad, apples, creamed horseradish: very creative and satisfying dish to start withCARROT FRIES jalapeño tofu dip: the dip was loaded with a pleasant amount of vinegar and just the right kick from jalapeño.

They're exactly what you would imagine deep fried carrots would taste like, but the batter is crispy and the carrots themselves feel hearty and clean, so they become quite addicting.I don't remember the rest of the meal, honestly. I had an entree with curry in it, and it just had *too many* spices for my liking.The black forest sundae was SO good, though. Who knew something so simple could be so delicious? The black cherry ice cream is flavorful and creamy and goes well with the chocolate sauce.

I had such high hopes for this restaurant and was just praying that just one dish would be the game changer, but nope. not luck. We ordered the- carrot fries: i acutally hate cooked.. carrots but i wanted to get this because everyone raved about it and perhaps i could get over my cooked carrots hate. I was expecting somewhat like mashed carrots and fried rather than just like.. a stick of cooked carrots and fried. That being said, i clearly wasn't a fan on this. - raw tuna : there was a kick to the dish and it was actually quite decent but i'm not too sure if it was memorable.- the crab cake toast was probably the best thing i ate here. it was light and fresh.- potato gnocchi: it was overcooked a bit and it fell apart each time i tried to take a bite- the octopus was cooked quite well but once again forgetable.- the carrot wellington : again i dont eat carrots and so i wasn't a fan of this.. it was wrapped around the pasty dough which i thought was the best part of the dish- the $76 dollar lamb. i was most excited for this dish.. but it honestly tasted like..pulled pork but a hint of lamb. i love the game-y taste to lamb and having that missing was sad...- the fruit tart/pie was a bit tooo tart-y for me and so i couldn't enjoy it- the chocolate strawberry cake was delicious though!To summarize, go here if you love carrots, nice ambiance, and a relaxing night.

5.0,8/9/2015,"I had the pleasure of eating at Narcissa last night for my brothers rehearsal dinner and couldn't have picked a better place.  My sister in law scoped out this gem beforehand and reserved the private room for the night.  This was by far one of the best meals I've had in Manhattan! Ambiance/service: hip and trendy yet also elegant and classy. You feel like this is a place to be seen. This restaurant is rather large with multiple seating areas, including an outdoor patio adorned with fairy lights.  Just absolutely picturesque.  The private seating area we were in was situated right off of the patio, so you could open the doors if you wish to enjoy the fresh air.  The wait staff was excellent, and eager to explain the intricate meals on the menu as well as share their personal recommendations. Cocktails/drinks: I don't drink too often but felt this deserved its own category. These drinks are very strong so order wisely! I ordered ""in the tall grass"" which was very light and refreshing tasting.  My sister in law got the ""so pretty"" which while I enjoyed very much, the consensus seems to think this was a more masculine and heavy drink.  I also tried the ""long hot summer"" cooler, also refreshing, but with a slightly overpowering grapefruit after taste.  As for dessert cocktails, I tried the ""peanut butter"" and ""mint"". While both were awesome, I love chocolate so much I feel that it stands best alone, and doesn't particularly mix well with other types of food or drink. The mint was creamy, delicious, and refreshing. Great complement to a decadent dessert! Food: in a word, incredible. Each meal was intricately designed so that your palate was completely satiated with every bite. I started with the raw tuna appetizer, each bite topped with jalapeño adding that perfect kick and infused in cucumber basil water. My only complaint was how small the dish was, I finished it within a few bites! For my entree I chose the carrot Wellington, a vegetarian play on beef Wellington. Fantastic as well, along with the baby chicken and trout (particularly if you like curry sauce), but my favorite dish that night was the 24oz bone in ribeye. The meat was cooked to perfection, with a crunchy/burnt top layer that tasted as if it were wrapped in bacon. Luckily they gave a generous portion to my sister in laws brother, and he gladly shared it with me. Dessert: I had the rhubarb Pavlov, which was interesting due to the many different ingredients they used, but it wouldn't necessarily order it again. Most people went for the ice cream here and I highly recommend getting the milk chocolate flavor.

2.0,8/7/2015,"Came here last night for my birthday, and I would have given the entire experience one more star based on the food and the ambiance of the restaurant, but the service (and the fact that they did at the end bring out a birthday candle) brought it down to two.We came in and were greeted nicely enough by the hostess and host. My boyfriend had told me he called once and spoke with a lady who was very accommodating and told us she could reserve a corner table for us (as we were celebrating). We were pretty excited seeing the beautiful restaurant and looking at the menu beforehand--we've also heard great things about the place. The maitre'd told the hostess we'd be for table number 51, and walked us two feet toward a two-seater table on the right-hand side of the restaurant, squeezed in between one corner table and another miserable looking couple. My boyfriend was definitely not happy about it, and spoke with the maitre'd about the arrangements, and they finally *decided* to be accommodating about it to take us to one of the four-seater corner tables by the windows, where ironically, three other couples were seated nearby. They were definitely NOT happy about it, which made us super confused, and a little put off by the whole ordeal. We had asked nicely way before our reservation date, and even seeing that there were plenty of other couples at the tables where we wanted made us feel like we were being jipped. Not the best start to the night.We sat at the table, were given our menus without much of a glance except a quick question about tap water, wine, etc. We decided to go for the Brunello di Montalcino 2006, which was brought out by the lovely sommelier (who was honestly the only person in the entire restaurant who gave us a smile). We then ordered the rotisserie beets and the potato gnocchi as appetizers, and the lamb shoulder for two with a side of spicy kale. I think the beets were one of my favorite dishes, along with the spicy kale. The lamb shoulder was extremely large, and came with a side of amazing rice, tzatziki, carrots, pita bread, and radishes. The potato gnocchi was way too bland, not cooked well, and needed a LOT more salt. The only other dish that was impressive was the spicy kale (which reminded me a little bit of hot kimchi).Someone beforehand mentioned how quickly the dishes came out; the appetizers came out in maybe less than 15 minutes? Which was pretty surprising, though the lamb shoulder took a bit longer to cook. In between that, we had multiple waiters and busboys come over to fill our water. BUT they never once cleaned the table or wipe it down, and one of the blonde waiters, who clearly didn't want to be serving us, poured water so freaking fast that he spilled over the table and partially on my boyfriend's sleeve. He didn't even apologize even though he went on to pour water for me a little more gently, and didn't even wipe it down. No words for this kind of service.We've been to plenty of the upscale restaurants around the city, and it's DEFINITELY hard to say that I'll be recommending this place to anyone. Here, they didn't care what you were or were not celebrating, and the service was WAY TOO HARSH, and not friendly at all. I'm not sure if it's the area or just the people, but the waitstaff (minus the sommelier) need to tone down their snobbiness a little bit, and lighten up. The best part of the night was noticing that no other couples were being seated, which means they just didn't seat us at the table we had requested for no apparent reason. Were we not VIP looking enough? We were dressed very well, and were as polite as possible, so this is pretty funny.Won't be returning, even though the garden out back looked positively gorgeous--and that by the way, was probably the third highlight of the evening, next to the wine & the beets.",1,0,0,Catherine P.,"New York, NY",179,15,5

Clean.Finding your way back from bathroom to dining area- 1/10. There's a camouflaged door! And 3 different dining rooms. And stairs, so many stairs. Food:Carrot fries- Carrots aren't my jam but damn son! These Beta Keratin fries were delicious! And they are good for your eyesight. Please don't stick these in your eyes. They go in your mouth, your mouth.Asparagus- I was expecting roasted asparagus with a drizzle of lemon. The exact opposite! Yogurt sauce! There was yogurt sauce!Raw Tuna- was my favorite. The cucumber-basil water was divine and I need to figure out how to make it. The correct way to eat this is to DRINK ALL THE BROTH. That's why they give you a spoon.Seed Crusted Skate- I feel bad for anyone that cannot digest seeds. This dish is worth getting Diverticulitis. You can definitely share this entree. It's so good that you may not want to, but be a pal and share this crusted goodness with your friends.Duck Breast- Crispy skin, a bit too much fat, accompanied with pureed turnips and cherries. The sides that came along with this bird differentiated it from a Peking Duck. I enjoyed the dish but I was hoping for it to be as spectacular as everything else. It's a solid duck though.Strawberry chocolate shortcake-A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Comes with scoop of ice cream. Save room for this.I preferred the dining room with the open kitchen. It was much more quiet.

I think I created a misunderstanding by mixing up the man bunned waiters and keeping the wrong one honest. I may have made an underhanded comment about their displeasing resemblance and how I didn't approve of their submission to a transiently popular hair style.Despite both my and the two bunned waiters' thinly disguised mutual antipathy, I tipped well for the good food and the Gary Cooper water man who kept everybody in check that morning.

Next, we ordered the gnocchi which had a yummy light cream sauce. The gnocchi themselves were light and airy and you could really taste the potato. For entrees we ordered the branzino and the sea bass. The branzino was a basic steamed fish. The fish was very fresh but simple and borderline boring. The sea bass was in a curry sauce. You could tell al the fish was very well quality. The sea bass had odd pairings of dried apricot almonds and charred onions. The slithered almonds and dry apricots tasted like trail mix on sea bass, but in a good way.

I am a vegan eater so I was a bit apprehensive as to what I could actually eat. Let me tell you, I left with a full happy stomach. Our waiter was impeccable and really surpassed above average service. I had the Carrot Fries with vegan jalepeno dipping sauce for starters. Mouth watering. The carrots were perfectly cooked and the dipping sauce was a fantastic contrast. I then moved on to the Vegan Caesar Salad that was filled with the perfect crunch. The dressing was phenomenally creamy and a much needed escape from my regular day to day eats. I then finished it off with the ramped up new potatoes. Let me tell you, I could have just devoured a bowl of that on its own. Sooo delicious! My friend had the octopus with chickpeas which he really enjoyed. For dessert we chose the Bittersweet Chocolate Tart with curry roasted bananas, and instead of the expresso Ice cream it comes with my waiter switched it out with a Rhubarb-Hibiscus sorbet. Another reason why he was so epic. I could have laid to rest at that very moment. Polished it all off with a bottle of wine. Let me tell you.

So getting here was pretty much a royal pain and we were soaked when we arrived. We sipped on a tequila cocktail which was perfectly crafted with the right amount of spicy kick on the finish. I enjoyed the Rose Sancerre by the glass and my husband and I noshed on the carrot fries (sweet but definitely heavily battered) and smoked trout skins (very yummy) before sitting down for dinner. It was astounding to see how bustling this creative New American adjacent to the Standard was on a Sunday evening. The two dining areas were full of beautiful people of all ages. We appreciated the effort made by young servers who aimed to please. Before ordering our wines by the glass, they obliged our requests got taste them. The French Chardonnay from Burgundy was terrific as was the Rose champagne and the Montepulciano red which was served chilled. And while the servers and bus boys were super attentive and on point bringing and clearing our dishes, they could use just a tad more experience or familiarity with menu descriptions and recommendations. Still....the whole rotisserie Branzino and the steamed bass with French lentils and curry were some of the most creative and tasty fish entrees I have eaten in a long time. The flavor combinations were incredible, citrus flavors were perfectly combined with herbs making the dishes refreshingly bright. I would come back in a second for both. The kale side was not run of the mill-spicy and delicious. And while the cauliflower side was incredibly rich and unexpectedly heavy, it is was memorable.

When E sent me the link about the four places to get crawfish, I was like OMG, I missed the Redhead one, and so I was definitely not going to miss this Narcissa one.I booked the appointment and came here with K during lunch and advised the waitress I was going to have the crawfish special.She didn't know what I was talking about, and so she went and came back and said it was offered ONLY in the garden.This was not made clearly on the website that was promoting New York's crawfish happenings.But moving on, they advised I couldn't get the crawfish here, I did stay and ate, but I will review that later.I called the number and this place was booked for crawfish and they had one opening left on Sunday at 4 pm.I didn't know who I was coming with, but I snagged that spot and so I came back the very next day after begging A and H to come.When we sat down, we were like is this going to be good, because H and I are Southerners and the ginger hair waitress wearing overalls with a crop top said I am from Louisiana and so is the chef. It is going to be so good.There was another black waiter there that wore one of sleeves up and rolled one side of his jeans up - ummm okay, we get it, you got branded, but why are you trying to let everyone know that you have yourself branded. You want a damn cookie? Like seriously, we didn't understand why he had to rock his outfit like that....trying too damn hard to let everyone know you hard or something.Moving on, we get our crawfish, and let me tell you it didn't look like 6 pounds worth of crawfish. Because it looked like the same portions as the people who were party of 2. Half of our portions were dead, yes, crawfish is supposed to be dead, but you're not supposed to cook them dead. I only had three crawfish that were alive, the rest were black and of course, you can't eat them. So paying money for this poor and beyond low quality is a slap in the face.I seriously, like seriously did some work into getting this reservation and convinced people they should come here on a Sunday to eat these crawfish, but only to have really bad crawfish.The andouille sausage were not good, H and A liked it and the Pecan Pie sucked.I didn't eat the corn, even though the promotion said corn and sausage, but why would you give 2 corn for 3 people. Doesn't make any sense.Not Southerner approved and seriously, if the waitress and chef are really from Louisiana, I definitely would stop telling people that, because by the taste of what just had, the chef sucks and the service from this Southern sucked too.She forgot H's second beer, forgot to communicate how to split the bill, forgot our andouille sausages, our napkins, and also the Asian Hostess there, my friend A said she kept forgetting how many people there were and kept asking over and over again.",2,1,1,Ro R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,2220,93

The food was fine, but the service was below any reasonable standard. The set meal consisted of andouille sausage, crawfish with corn and potatoes, and pecan pie. We waited 30 minutes for our sausage, and finally asked why no food had come out -- we got some nonsense about ""problems in the kitchen"" (while other tables around us where eating their sausage, so it wasn't THAT severe a problem). Then our sausage app arrived after our crawifsh. After that, our ""server"" asked if we wanted dessert (we said ""yes""), and 20 minutes later, came to bring us our check -- before we'd even gotten the dessert. He professed surprise that we hadn't received our dessert, but there should have been no surprise, since he spent the intervening time chatting with the people next to us about his acting career. When we expressed our unhappiness with the service, he acted like we were out of line, and then had another server bring us back our check (to be fair, he did comp us our drinks, which is the only reason we left any tip at all). The pecan ""pie"", btw, was really a pecan bar -- we've had (and made) better, and it certainly wasn't worth a long wait. Let me be clear: in 45 years on this planet, I have never, in a sit-down restaurant, been brought my check before my food had arrived. Never; it's an unthinkable breach of the relationship between server and patron. We can't help but wonder if our age relative to the youth of the generally hipster crowd at the restaurant was a factor in why we got served significantly slower than anyone else, but whatever the reason, with 25,000 restaurants in the NYC area, there's no reason we or anyone else should ever have to put up with poor service twice at the same restaurant.P.S. The bathroom to which my wife was directed (by an attendant!) was filthy -- the previous occupant evidently couldn't be bothered to aim -- and when she pointed it out to the attendant, that person didn't apologize but mopped the floor and then told my wife to go ahead.

Had excellent Mezcal cocktail and bottle of Pinot from Willamette OR was great. Nice wine list!  Four of us worked our way through about 8-9 dishes. Small plate highlights for me were the Mushroom Gnocchi, Tempura battered Carrots.  My sister loved the rotisserie beats and cucumber w/ crab meat. Highlight of the meal was the Lamb Shoulder. WOW!!! Unbelievable flavor and fall apart texture. Was not overly ""lamby"" but full of rich flavor. Says its for 2 people, but easily enough for 4.  My brother in law and I crushed it! Served with a few sauces, fresh mint, pita bread..like a giant make your own pita sandwich station.  One of the best meat dishes I have had in years. My niece had the lacquered duck...also outstanding. Cooked perfectly with a sweet glaze. Was ooohing and aaahhing while eating... Excellent dish! Only dish slightly disappointing was the whole roasted branzino. A bit dry and not super flavorful, have had it better at other restaurants. 4 of us split the ice cream sundae and chocolate tart for dessert.  Both very good, although by then I was in a lamb coma! Service was excellent across the board. Restaurant is great for vegetarians and carnivores alike. Classy but not stuffy.  Really nice place!

Inside, the decor makes you feel like you are having lunch at the New School cafeteria, it's not charming, boring at best. I do ate blonde wood in general, unless it's a Japanese restaurant.The food was good, the skillet burger and vegetable lasagna were delicious, so were the avocado toasts, the eggs Benedict looked a bit sad.

It's embarrassing to have to tell the rest of your group ""5 more minutes"" ten times, while they stand on the sidewalk looking at their watches for an hour.

3.0,5/18/2015,"The party atmosphere of Narcissa on a Friday night with a jubilant urban crowd and big courtyard patio referenced a New Orleans care free hedonism.  Drinks in the $12 range weren't a surprise, but the genuinely kind and solicitous waitstaff were, who managed to helpfully score us a table quickly like we were good friends they were hooking up.Our jolly table side colleagues were also quick to befriend us, making this bar hop stint a prudent one, especially if you're willing to shell out $15 for a 6 ounce appetizer portion of guacamole.A young fun party scene without pretense, that feels both a mix of divey and nightclub.The thought of Narcissa as a decent restaurant wasn't evident after 10pm on a Friday, where no one was eating, and everyone was drinking.",7,3,4,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2400,4299
4.0,5/17/2015,"I was so impressed with Narcissa!  First of all, I love that you can make brunch reservations--I'm so over the two-hour wait, overhyped brunch situation.  Second, as others have noted the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful, very open-air with a fresh, verdent garden and very flattering lighting.  I felt like i was in a magazine spread.  Finally, the service was fantastic--we waited a while to order since we were having sort of a catch-up session and they were very patient and just let us do our thing.  As far as the food goes, it was also great.  We split the French toast sticks and the carrot fries--the fries seemed a little over-hyped since obviously anything-tempura is going to taste good, but they weren't like GOOD good.  The french toast sticks were great though, and my egg white omelete was fantastic--it was very cheesy and covered in a bright pesto sauce.  My only regret is not ordering a mimosa since it seems like they squeeze their own juice--next time!  I'd also love to try dinner.",1,0,0,Maeve M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",317,539,111
2.0,5/16/2015,"Beautiful, warm day out in the garden at Narcissa.   Wonderful staff was on their game and kept the ice water coming. Was disappointed with the wine from the Languedoc, especially at $60 per bottle. The staff decanted it, but it still lacked complexity and a decent nose. It was like drinking an $18.00 Pinot Noir from Napa. Would be wise to drop this one from the list.  We tolerated it and focused on simple, roasted branzino, lightly steamed veggies, and Spring-time, green salads. Carrot fries were stellar. The vegetarian cauliflower dish over rice was cloyingly sweet and begged for something other than a garnish of pickled cucumber... Kind of off kilter, or maybe too Chinese for this supposedly European-influenced menu. I wanted to enjoy the culinary offerings as much as the space here.  But, there is a timidity lurking behind this pristine, careful menu. The Italian manager spoke with a French accent the first time I visited here, and with an Italian accent the next time... Now what is that about, especially since the menu seemed very Asian-slanted, but not in any obvious way?       Lots of inconsistencies in what they are trying to become, perhaps looking to draw in a diverse crowd, but sacrificing much more distinctiveness of style in their coking in order to stand out as a truly superlative establishment. But, we are New Yorkers, and observe these little details. Please don't become one more average, hotel restaurant!         Desserts were artistically composed, especially the citrus tart and chocolate tart. These seemed to know their place and belonged there. Otherwise, Narcissa needs to re-think its menu and break out, with more panache, perhaps expanding it a bit, as well.  Too many average dishes and an insufficient number of innovations were producing lots of yawns from the crowd.         Brunch, especially for larger groups, requires a whole new approach.I recommended Narcissa as a pretty place in which to have a Sunday brunch, and wasdisappointed to find that no one in this large group could name one thing they atethat was in any way special.  Come on, Narcissa, this is your moment. Do something great. You are not a diner with lofty prices. Please do not rest on your early, positive reviews. Never going to make it.       However, on a brighter note, I loved the servers.  They were keenly aware of all that was happening at each table and did not have to be asked twice for anything, whatsoever.  A young man from Italy showed us the party room just off of the garden, describing some of the celebrations having taken place there as if he were the proud owner of this establishment. He seemed to be on the path to becoming a fabulous restauranteur, and/or chef, with excellent people skills, charm, and an enthusiasm for his work.  If this restaurant doesn't make it, it will not be because of the service.    Someone has to get this kitchen in gear and get out of the 90's.",0,0,0,Lucienne D.,"Hoboken, NJ",17,171,0

Usually we go by yelp reviews and word of mouth but this time we decided to just go for it, and boy was it worth it! The decor of this place is by far the nicest I have seen in a while. Everything looked clean fresh top notch and unique. Every corner you turn you see something interesting design wise. The service was good, our waiter was very nice and explained the specials, kept our drinks full and made some recommendations The food was amazing. Every appetizer was so tasty light fresh and unique mimicking the decor. Everything felt healthy and incorporated greens and veggies in some way. We had the raw tuna, the octopus, spinach dip, the gnocchi (omg), and a salad. For entrees we had the Bronzino and the taco chicken. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the ice cream sundae.

4.0,5/4/2015,"KenScale: 8.5/10On a lovely spring evening, I had a chance to re-visit Narcissa in about a year. The hype since its opening has somewhat toned down and I saw plenty of empty tables on a Sunday evening (although it started to get pack in the course of my meal pretty quickly). The space is still as sleek as its opening days, with a lively and trendy ambiance emanating from the dining room making it for a great date spot in my opinion. The menu at Narcissa hasn't changed much since my prior visit (although it could be more of coincidence given that I haven't had a chance to visit this place in any season other than the spring). The food here is still very delicious and well-executed, with beautiful plating that pays homage to nature and chef John Fraser's strength in farm-to-table cuisine with emphasis on vegetables. The famed rotiseerie-crisped beets and carrots Wellington were still great, two of the outstanding vegetable dishes this city has to offer, with refined flavor and great texture that might tempt you to turning vegetarian. I'm not a fan of gnocchi in general, but the potatoe gnocchi here is one of the more successful dishes I've had in the city, with silky smooth texture and the combination of mushrooms and asparagus working harmoniously with the underlying parmesan that fortunately wasn't overwhelmingly heavy. I was also a fan of steamed bass that came with French curry broth along with lentils and toasted almonds. Not only was the fish perfectly cooked but the reserved yet elegant flavor of curry broth added another dimension to this dish. I was somewhat sad that the restaurant didn't have the citrus fruit salad for dessert, but loved both dessert dishes that I tried. Pomegranate poached pear had versatility of delicate and refreshing, while bittersweet chocolate tart that came with curry roasted bananas and expresso ice cream was pure decadence that I couldn't stop diggin even though I was pretty full by then.Located in the hip Standard Hotel East Village, Narcissa is still going strong. I suggest you make a visit soon. If the weather gets even warmer, try dining al fresco to savor your meal.",5,1,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
4.0,5/3/2015,"Narcissa has some of the most delicious, respectful preparation of vegetables I've experienced outside a vegetarian restaurant.  After our meal here, my friends and I declared it the year of the carrot!  I went in knowing I wanted to try a great number of vegetable dishes and I wasn't disappointed.  The rotisserie beets and the cauliflower were particular appetizer standouts (the gnocchi, carrot fries and duck pate were all good as well but not particularly noteworthy).  The beets were earthy and creamy and fresh with dill.  The cauliflower had an intense, rich Asian flavor.  I also really enjoyed the warm, fresh bread they served to start.  It was buttery and had this nice, kind of sourdough tang.  For my entree, I was compelled to try the carrot Wellington as it sounded so unique and there was so much buzz around this dish.  It was a very tasty rendition of Wellington and the carrots were meaty and well seasoned and tasted great with the sunchoke puree.  However, then I tried a piece of my friend's duck and that was so fatty and rich and decadent that I ended up wishing I could order some duck with carrots Wellington on the side.  The baby chicken was also juicy and flavorful which was impressive based on the size of the bird!  For dessert, the poached pear was beautifully presented and sweet, firm and juicy.  The sundae was fine but a little cloyingly sweet with the strawberry pieces.  The service was very good - attentive, informative, and respectful.  I had a great time at Narcissa and would go back for the beets, cauliflower and the duck!",1,0,0,Lisa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",141,211,0
4.0,4/29/2015,"IN SHORT: Light, fresh, and playful food defies expectations with startling flavor at this East Village hotspot. Take a vegetarian or a girl who likes to pretend to eat healthy here on a date, and you'll change all the expectations she has about you, too.THE STORY: When I first think about food and drink served at one of André Balazs' Standard Hotels, I cringe. I picture an overhyped scene full of Euro bankers who are in from out of town and trying to be seen by women who go out to dinner in Herve Leger dresses as they have bottle service brought over to their table at 10 PM by dancers on an inflatable motorcycle. What I do not picture is Narcissa, a truly farm-to-table, vegetable-focused, New American restaurant led by Dovetail chef John Fraser.And yet here Narcissa is, tucked into the ground floor of the Standard in the East Village, surprising all of us with a menu full of powerfully flavored vegetables and roots that reveal a little bit of Mr. Fraser's California heritage.Indeed, the cooking at Narcissa, named after a beauty of a cow on André Balazs' private farm a few hours north of the city, manages to showcase the refinement of Mr. Fraser's skills while maintaining a relaxed style accessible to the restaurant's many varied patrons. This light, playful mode of cooking is particularly elegant in what is undoubtedly the most successful dish on the menu, the Carrots Wellington. Carrots have never shined so brightly or cleanly in this vegetarian take on the original, with salt-cured roasted carrots wrapped in sweet, crispy puff pastry and balanced by bluefoot mushrooms, sunchokes, and gremolata. The carrots themselves are tender with a bite, held together by a dark walnut paste that adds a subtle, nutty depth in the background of the gloriously earthy root vegetable.Seasonal, local ingredients also shine in the Lacquered Duck Breast with spring onions, creamed turnips, and a sour cherry jus that beautifully highlights one of the most interesting treatments of duck skin I've seen lately. The skin is bewilderingly thick, crispy, sweet, and spicy all at once, framing a succulent and expertly-cooked piece of meat. If you're a vegetarian embracing they bounty of options at Narcissa, you might still regret not being able to try this fine duck.For the appetizers, however, a few flaws in the options that rely too much on meat and seafood prove once again that vegetables are still the loving star at Narcissa. The Raw Tuna in cucumber-basil water with burdock and a jalapeño relish was a major disappointment, with flavors that struggled to define themselves in a pool of virtually flavorless water with a dearth of seasoning.When I was here for dinner with one of my favorite dining friends, we also shared the fried Manchurian Cauliflower as an appetizer. While we were eager for the gingery, sweet and sour spices right after the lackluster tuna, she noticed that the flavor profile of the sticky sauce was far too strong to be paired as a side with any dish, as it is meant to be on the menu. The generous flavors, while full of rich, savory chili tang, would have simply clashed with almost any of our main courses, except perhaps the fresh Steamed Bass in a curry broth with lentils.Despite these occasional floundering moves, Narcissa is still a chic, sophisticated presentation of farm-to-table dining that rightly doesn't try to hit you over the head with the concept. With a charming staff and happy couples that seem to be on a date at almost every neighboring table, Narcissa is much more than a trendy hotel restaurant that prioritizes scene over substance, and I will always be grateful for what it has contributed to dining in New York.Yet I will now always blame Narcissa for changing my expectations each time I walk into another hotel restaurant for dinner and get anything less than fresh, impeccably-sourced vegetables cooked with exemplary skill and passion.",2,2,2,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

We shared the barley risotto with leeks and little neck clams to start, as well as the charred octopus with kabocha squash. The appetizers were the highlights and I kind of wish we had stuck with small dishes. From here we shared the carrots wellington and the pork. The carrots were a strange dish and did not have as much flavor as I had hoped. They seemed careless wrapped in pastry and while this is a creative idea, it was not well-executed. The pork was a combination of loin and belly and the belly was not crispy or caramelized at all but a thick, undercooked piece of inedible fat. Half the dish consisted of this belly.  Both dishes were mediocre and more like two star entrees. Desserts were not enticing enough to order, always a sad thing.Service was great and I do enjoy their bread so rounding this up to three stars overall but I'd rather eat somewhere else in the city that never sleeps.",14,14,14,Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4564,1592,1644

After spending sometime with our menus we ordered the beet and gnocchi appetizers with a side of manchurian cauliflower and for our mains got a vegetarian risotto, carrots willington, baby chicken and herbed pork. All this while we were having our wine and saw tables which had arrived after us getting a portion of the house bread. Eventually we had to ask our server to get us the bread which arrived with our appetizers. The appetizers were delicious and very different and we all thoroughly enjoyed them. Then began the wait which continued for so long that it turned into irritation. After waiting for over 45 mins, seeing tables arriving after us finishing their meals, we finally asked our server about the status of our food and he answered saying there is some issue in the kitchen and we should speak to the manager. The manager came over and was really nice and give us the entrees for free however the experience was completely ruined and did not get better after that. The entrees arrived and were average in taste and the service continued to be dismal. I'm not sure whether I would go back.

1.0,4/6/2015,"Was excited to finally try this place as it's close to my apartment. Went for brunch and was very disappointed. Our appetizers were OK. The best part were the cinnamon rolls. But after finishing them we waited a good 40 minutes with dirty plates, as our eggs were nowhere in site.Once we got our main courses each of us ordered poached eggs, all the eggs were either soft or hard boiled. Had to send them back... The excuse for avocado toast that comes with the poached eggs is pathetic. The bread was hard as rock, literally, could not eat it. Every single egg tasted like water, it was so weird. The ham on the eggs Benedict was cold and looked like it fell off the slab of some sad Christmas party. Don't order the fries. You will pay $8 for literally a tea cup of fries. Not kidding, it was actually kind of funny, we were finished with he fries by the time they brought ketchup.  (Which we had to request, because its so fancy-Nancy) We had to send back the poached eggs because the dish was laughable, especially for the price. Even after waiting over an hour to get our EGGS (they take 2 minutes to make) we never once got a sorry, free Bellini, or hello from a manager...I'm not sure they have one.

5.0,4/1/2015,"I've admired Chef John Fraser's creative work before at his pop up What Happens When. I've also visited Dovetail in the UWS and while the food was very good it lacked the creativity he demonstrated at What Happens When. So when Narcissa opened I was naturally curious to see how well it would be received. Then the accolades came pouring in and I knew I had to pay it a visit. After I was unable to get dinner reservations for a family dinner I was thrilled to hear the restaurant was participating in Restaurant Week and I booked lunch reservations right away. First, a quick word on the space. It's beautiful and a world away from the drab interior of Dovetail. The high ceilings and long windows allow plenty of light in and at day the dining room almost feels as if you're in an atrium. At night the warm lights give the restaurant a cozy yet lively atmosphere.Now let's talk of the food. We ordered the Narcissa salad, a kabocha squash soup and the roasted beets. The beets! Oh wow! I'm personally not a huge fan of beets. I detest borscht and when I was a kid my mom's attempt at cooking beets made it one of only 2 vegetables that I generally avoided. But after hearing that the beets at Narcissa will make you want to return I had to try it. Sure enough, I was floored. I simply have never tasted beets like these before. They were sweet and complex and together with the bulgur salad and horseradish cream the dish was splendid! When our entrees arrived it became clear that vegetables took center stage at Narcissa. The vegetable lasagna won over the fish. For desserts we had a sundae and a panna cotta. Both were quite good. But really the most memorable dish were the beets and I would love to come back again for those. My boyfriend and I agreed this was the best restaurant week meal we've had in recent memory.

The place is pretty well lit on Sunday morning if you happen to sit on the same side as the open kitchen. Service was prompt and professional, prices were decent for New York. I had ordered the Poached Eggs and Avocado Toast, my other half their Egg White Frittata, and a side order of bacon to share. To drink we had coffee and a orange & ginger seltzer por moi. The bacon was super thick and crunchy. My eggs were perfect, as were the avocado spread on my toast. If you happen to like pesto sauce, I would highly recommend the Egg White Frittata. For dessert, we had shared their delicious Gingerbread cake dessert. The kumquats in contrast with the ice cream and cake were quite lovely.Our visit was pretty conservative, but if you're looking to go in on Sunday brunch, I would get that side biscuit with lavender butter and order of donuts for the table.

4.0,3/21/2015,I chose this as my birthday dinner this year and was very pleased with the derive and food. I only give four stars because it was not as intimate as one would have hoped and because the dessert menu wasn't great. Where did that carrot cake that everyone posted about go?I had the gnocchi and sweet potato as appetizers. Both were good but the sweet potato was great. The gnocchi was awfully soft but was outshines by the sweet potatoes with a spicy sauce and crispy chips to top it off. I had the steamed bass which was exceptional and they did a great job with flavors and textures overall. I had the carrot fries which everyone seems to love but they are really just fried carrots. Anything fried tastes good to me. The cauliflower side was also deep battered and fried but tasted like something from a high end Chinese restaurant.I was not crazy about the sourdough bread to start (however I liked the salty exterior) because the butter was rock hard. How do you spread hard butter on a soft bread? Just a pet peeve of mine. The desserts all looked bad so we headed to Lafayette for drinks and dessert.

The food is American with a twist. Think bagels for breakfast but served as crisps with three different shmears (lox, yogurt and hummus). Or chicken made out of cauliflower (must try, if only for the interest factor). Or sweet potato dipping fries. There's a full bar and a cocktail list.

5.0,3/7/2015,"I've been wanting to check this place out for quite some time. So when it appeared on the Restaurant Week list for lunch, I decided to come with 4 coworkers for my birthday. I usually go to 4-5 restaurants during Restaurant Week every time and this was probably the best meal I've had so far. They serve the same items as they do on their regular lunch menu so you're getting a good deal. Every dish is delicious and perfectly flavored. They don't feel mass-produced as they do at many other restaurants during Restaurant Week. We started with an order of carrot fries which were unique and very good. We also ordered virgin drinks with cucumber water which were delicious.Then we tried the kambocha squash soup -very good. Beet salad -- I don't like beets but this was great; the beers weren't overpowering and the sauces and garnishes like vinegar had all sorts of fun flavors that all worked well together. For mains, we tried the trout and the rotisserie chicken. The trout came with curry flavors and many interesting garnishes that also worked well together. The chicken was super juicy and had the perfect crispy skin.The desserts were both delicious as well. We tried both.Highly recommended. We really enjoyed our meal.",1,0,0,I.

5.0,3/4/2015,"Don't be fooled by their simplistic menu - everything is gorgeous about this restaurant, including the decor and the taste/plating of the food.We came here for the first day of restaurant week (yay!) and tried out items on their RW menu. I think everything was fantastic other than the desserts, which were kind of disappointing.For appetizers, we picked the kabocha squash soup and rotisserie-crisped beets - the latter was definitely the superstar. This was a fresh yet warm salad, with a very good balance between the sweet beets, and the acidic horseradish/dressing.Next, we got the vegetarian lasagna and rotisserie chicken w/ root & rye stuffing. They both had extremely great flavors and textures throughout. The dishes also came out piping hot, just the way I like it. Even though the lasagna was only filled with vegetables, it was still just as delicious and filling.One of the desserts we got was the yogurt rose panacotta with fresh citrus salad, frozen blood orange carpaccio. The plating was gorgeous, but the taste of the dish fell very flat. The peanut butter ice cream sundae did NOT match anything that was served to us that day; even though it was good (I mean, who can turn down a peanut butter sundae), it seemed like something that you would be able to get at a diner :(.When you enter the restaurant, particularly during the day (I went during lunch), the dining room looks so bright and fresh - it definitely makes your dining experience very pleasant, cozy, and enjoyable!

The squash vinaigrette was interesting, tangy and creamy.The waitress asked us if we had any food allergy. It's nice that they care. I had an eye on the Gingerbread cake but she said it's not gluten free. I wished to try the poached kumquats that comes with it, but my friend shared her dessert which has slices of kumquats and I ate them.Restrooms: I went through the wooden door and found myself in a hotel lobby. Then I walked few steps back and went downstairs. I saw a beautiful space with many individual toilet rooms. When it was time to come out, I tried to slide the door but it wouldn't open (panic mode).

The staff was really accommodative and was able to seat 2 of us at the chef's table right away (I was also able to be accommodated immediately when I went last time - not at all meant to imply that the restaurant isn't doing really well). Also the servers are really nice and flexible with ordering. They checked several times how we enjoyed our meal. And also sitting in front of the chefs making dessert, we were able to start a friendly conversation. The food was pretty good - some dishes definitely better than others. The cauliflower - awesome. It had a sweet and sour sauce that was really tasty. We also ordered two different fishes - branzino and a bass, which both had a really beautiful presentation. The branzino was simply cooked with fennel and lemon and the bass had lentils and a cumin curry sauce on top that was also very enjoyable. I didn't like our salad, the narcissa salad. It tasted like bacon, although that was not an ingredient in the dish. Also the octopus salad was worth eating - very tender.

4.0,2/17/2015,"I would give Narcissa 4 stars based on their skillet burger alone. I had it for brunch and it was just about perfect. Hard to go wrong with a  combination of short rib and brisket on a La Freida patty. Manchego cheese, watercress and guacamole rounds up  a delicious burger which is all held together by a brioche bun. They recommend it medium rare and so do I. We were a party of 6 for brunch so I got to sample a couple of other things. Usually I'm not a fan of biscuits but the biscuits and gravy here  was unlike anywhere else. The sausage gravy makes a difference but the biscuits themselves weren't dry and I didn't have to wash my throat with a drink after every bite which is what I generally feel like doing.Couple of things that failed to meet our expectations were the schnitzel (dry) and the frittata (over done). Actually over cooked eggs were a problem here. Any eggs ordered over easy came back over done and this is where I have my biggest issue. During brunch, the MINIMUM I expect you to do is get my eggs right.  My friend's burger also came medium well instead of medium rare and we had to send it back. To their credit however, every thing that  went back to their kitchen, came back out properly within 5 minutes - which is why I am not taking away any stars from them. They even hooked us up with free dessert and those were all great.I should mention that their cocktails were fantastic. I had the Fly Me To Tulum and tried my friend's bloody mary.

The tuna itself wasn't the highest-quality I'd ever had, but this dish was so addictive with the cucumber-basil ""broth""- I had to slurp every last drop upGrilled short rib: lip-smacking! The meat is perfectly cooked, tender but beautifully caramelized on the edges like pastrami, while the buttermilk/radish complemented it beautifullyPotato gnocchi- well executed, pillowy gnocchi, but the flavors were a little mild compared to the restCarrot fries: battered and served with jalapeno dip, these were just ok, salvaged by the high quality of the carrotsDessert was gingerbread cake with kumquats and eggnog ice cream- this was very unique, with all the components gelling together wonderfullyA pear tree (cocktail): pleasant, very peary and mildly herbalI also had a greek white wine (Argyros Assyrtiko) that was incredibly tasty, and this coming from someone who doesn't do whites.

The bass was cooked to perfection and the curry was light and flavorful and you just want to keep eating it ! -Bone-in ribeye: scrumptious! We ordered medium rare it was cooked perfectly ! It's comparable to the bone-in ribeye I had at del friscos -Duck Brest - superb, the skin was nice and crispy the meat was tender and juicy! -Roasted whole chicken- it was delicious the whole chicken is juicy and flavorful!

Super green sides - another instance where the preparation was not mentioned.  It said sauteed greens with potato chips.  It was sauteed in cream, which I can't eat.  Usually if there's no preparation mentioned, I would assume greens are sauteed in olive oil.",0,0,0,Heather B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,79,0
5.0,1/22/2015,"Narcissa is lovely! Located next to the Standard East, it's a warm, cozy, and surprisingly roomy space.  We sat in the area with the open kitchen, which was great. Appetizers: beets, Narcissa salad, Brussels sprouts salad, and gnocchi. The Brussels sprouts salad was by far my favorite: crispy shaved sprouts, Manchego, ham (who wouldn't like that!?) and a tangy vinaigrette. Narcissa salad also delicious (and I'm not usually one to rave about a salad!). I had the char for an entree, which was delicious and perfectly seared atop a celery root puree. Our party of eight ordered all the sides and they were all HUGE hits. Dill potatoes are buttery and tender. The spinach with potato chips is a decadent and delicious dish that is just green enough to pass as something healthy! I did not LOVE the carrot fries - found them a little too heavy. We all cleaned our plates (other entrees at our table included the bass, pork, duck, and branzino).Dessert was pleasantly surprising. Upon hearing more about the ""deconstructed"" tiramisu, I decided to pass. I like tiramisu the way it is, not broken down and dressed up in a different way; however, upon taking a bite of a shared tiramisu, I was completely converted! Chocolate cake replaces lady fingers for a light and airy dessert that is just sweet enough without being cloying. The ice cream served with the bittersweet chocolate tart sits on a small mound of...coffee granules? Salt? Oreo cookie crumbles? Couldn't tell what, but that coffee ice cream, smooth and silky, coated with whatever those delicious little crumbs were was utterly transcendent.Service very kind, friendly, helpful, attentive, and served our party of eight at a small table very gracefully.

Thanks heavens for places who accept brunch ressies!  Hate places that don't.  The restaurant was still hopping around this time and included the beautiful brunch crowd.  The decor is nice, albeit a bit cramped... the restaurant might be a little hard to find but hint hint it's inside the Standard Hotel. While the service is polite and attentive, it's a bit slow and from the attire of the servers to the coat check at the door I get a sense Narcissa is trying to be a bit fancier than its food.  It's simple, clean, seasonal cooking that makes use of produce to the nine which I am happy about.  I think their dinner menu is stronger so you should come for that but if you are coming to brunch, here's what we had:- The Green Juice- my friend had this and she said it wasn't overly ""green"" aka bitter so perhaps good for those not really into juice-Bloody Mary, standard-The freshly squeezed OJ - my choice, which was...well freshly squeezed and good!-The iced cinna buns to start, wish they were a bit stickier and hotter in their skillet but these were lovely, soft, doughy and not overly sweet-The fresh toast bites- which fell a wee bit short, tasting to eggy and not enough flavor. The lemon curd it came with though was nice and refreshing. -I had the Narcissa salad as my main meal considering I was diving into all those buns, and it was lovely. Soft grated cheese, nutty from pistachios, all that seasonal produce, like raddichio and a hint of citruis- this is listed as a starter but if you're sharing a bunch of stuff it's filing plenty.   I had the side of carrot fries as well to accompany these - those definitely lived up to the hype but then again I love anything fried.  Simple carrots fried in tempura batter served with salt and a spicy green dipping sauce. Yum.My friends had:the pork schnitzel- very thinly pounded, thin and lemon-y. I did not try it but it looked really good and came with celery on the side as well as a German potato salad type of thing. the veggie lasagna which is actually a red sauce base (its description makes it sound very bechamel-only).. I did not try it but my friend said it was delish and very filling. In fact she barely touched it and packed it to go.  She also had a side of the biscuit which was big and came with a yummy lavendar honey (and pretty) butter.  It looked a bit dry itself but again I didn't have it.In the end, brunch came to $120 ish but then again we had a lot of different things..

The entire team from the front desk to the table was attentive and congenial.  We were promptly seated and efficiently served.  I'm a wine drinker but I couldn't resist a cocktail called Fly Me to Tulum which combined tequila, mezcal, blood orange, pomegranate and a spicy kick of jalapeno.  It's as good as it sounds and it packs a punch! The warm sourdough bread, served with Vermont butter, is excellent. I limited myself to only one chunk with great difficulty but I wanted to leave room to enjoy the rest of the meal.  Good thing I did.  We shared the rotisserie crisped beets and grilled sweet potatoes to start, both delicious.  The arctic char was exceptional, perfectly cooked and it melted in our mouths. The osso buco, in a more refined than traditional presentation, was equally tender and flavorful.  We added the tasty supergreen spinach topped with crunchy potato chips. Wine choices by the glass are limited but I had a nice glass of Dolcetto with the mains.  Servings are on the small side but more than enough for us. We shared the bittersweet chocolate tart with espresso ice cream and roasted bananas which was very good.  I'm not crazy about bananas but my husband enjoyed them.  I finished with a good espresso.   All in all an excellent meal.Narcissa offers tremendous value for the quality.  The room is warm and lively without being unbearably loud and seating is comfortable.  People tended to dress in a casual chic style, not too fancy but not overly dressed down.  We felt very relaxed and contented throughout the evening.It's definitely worth a trip if you're not from the neighborhood.  Highly recommended.",1,0,0,Barbara M.,"New York, NY",8,87,0

For me, stars are usually about the food, unless something else stands out as abysmally bad or fantastically amazing.So, back the food. It was just, well, underwhelming. My brother ordered the half chicken, which was the best entree at the table. The skin was crisped to perfection, the meat was intensely flavorful and moist. They have a rotisserie in the kitchen, so it's just really, really good.The Arctic Char was also pretty special. Unfortunately, I didn't order the Char or the Chicken. I had the Duck (meh, and room temperature) along w/ the gnocchi. It was good, but not great.Appetizers: baked oysters, just ok. Carrot fries? Awesome. I'd go back for a cocktail, chicken, and the carrot fries. Done.So in summary, it's inconsistently ok.

Rosemary was incredibly hard and made me fear I might puncture my tongue at any moment. The barley risotto was quite nice and had a balanced flavor.As for the gnocchi entree, the portion as an entree was incredibly small. My date immediately asked me if I wanted to order another entree when he saw the portion size (bear in mind I am a fit 5'2"" and a size 2-not a football quarterback), but I was already disenchanted with the food and opted against. The potato gnocchi had a grainy consistency to it which was not helped at all by the minimal amount of incredibly hard butternut squash in the dish.Granted that I don't eat meat I cannot comment on the flavor of his duck breast, but there seemed to be an excessive amount of fat he had to trim from the breast. Nothing at all like the duck breast at Park Avenue Autumn he had last night and could not stop raving about. He remained notably silent throughout this meal.Carrot fries were nothing special, between the two of us we ate 1.The poached pear was absolutely amazing and the only thing I would recommend on the menu.Now, onto the LACK of service that dragged this from a 3 star review to a 1 star review (actually, I would have left no review at all and might have even returned given that I live nearby).At no point did our server check in on us to ask if we were enjoying our meal. I had to ask twice for balsamic vinegar and my date waited 15 minutes for his drink until finally I flagged the waiter down and reminded him. No apology. Complete attitude throughout our meal-we really are the easiest customers imaginable, we always order a substantial amount (including 3-6 drinks) at every meal. If he had told us there was an incredible bottle on the menu or raved about some additional item we should try as we ordered we would happily have ordered it. Not that profiling your customers is ever appropriate, but if he was discriminating based off of our relatively young ages this should have been offset by price insensitivity.Here comes the kicker-I asked him if they can do an iced soy chai tea latte, which he said no to, and which is fine given that it is a more obscure request. I asked for an iced soy latte, to which he responded that they don't make any iced beverages. Fine. I order a soy latte and the poached pear dessert, then innocuously say ""I'm sorry, I'll actually change to a skim cappuccino and the poached pear."" Soy milk can take on a funny consistency in hot beverages, which took my a split second to remember given my almost exclusive consumption of iced beverages.BEN'S' RESPONSE-""'You know, there is a Starbucks around the corner."" He said this with the most patronizing smirk on his face then sauntered away. Not wanting to ruin the lovely evening I was having I spoke with my date and asked him to not tip excessively as is par for the course with him. Context: we had a very sweet server 2 weeks ago who seemed genuinely happy in her job and who was very attentive. We had an appetizer and 4 drinks and the check came to $59. Her tip was $150.I really don't know why Ben was so rude to us throughout our meal, but I assure you we will never return to Narcissa and allow ourselves to be condescended to again.(Disclaimer- The hostess and Maitre'D were absolutely lovely.

Very tasty. The appetizers were quite good, too. We shared the mission figs and grilled shrimp. My entree was the baby chicken. I mean, the chicken was tender and all, but why am I eating a baby? Perhaps it was more the idea of the food than the food itself, but there wasn't a lot of meat on the bone, it being a baby I was eating, after all. Now I know why people protest the eating of veal.

I am reflecting back on the meal and am not excited about it at all. What really pissed me off is that we were asked to leave our table after the meal. I found this very rude and unacceptable and do not think a nice restaurant should ever do this unless they tell you that you only have the table for a set amount of time in advance. We honestly were not even there for very long and we spent a good amount on all our food and drinks. The man who asked us to give us the table did offer to buy us drinks at the bar, which we accepted, but this does not make up for it seeing as we had just paid the bill minutes before. The bar area was very crowded and all the seats were taken. We were in the corner section and two people near us got up to leave.

I tried all of the following: -Mission Figs-Long Island Fluke Crudo-Grilled Shrimp-Farm Egg-Potato Gnocchi-Steamed Bass-Duck Breast-Braised Lamb -Carrot Fries-Fall Ice Cream SundaeFigs/ricotta app was a good choice. Crudo was an extremely small portion but I think the bite I got was a good one. Shrimp were nothing special. Farm egg felt like your traditional scrambled eggs. Potato Gnocchi was fine, nothing mind-blowing. The steamed bass had a curry broth that I did not like. It was a particularly sour taste but maybe thats just me not loving all curries. I'm a Penang curry kind of girl and maybe this curry and i were not friends. The lamb and duck were the most popular amongst the group. The carrot fries are ordinary and nothing spectacular. The sundae also fell short but I did enjoy the shredded carrots inside. The icing on the cake was when we got kicked out of our table by the manger. it was still under 2 hours from when we were seated and he said he would offer to buy us drinks at the bar if we got up.

I have no idea why crab cakes Eggs Benedict is $10 more than every other kind of Benedict at $26. I saw it come to a table. Still didn't get why it was nearly $30. I didn't hear orgasmic sounds coming from that table either, so...The carrot fries are over-rated. It really is a subjective matter of taste. I thought they were bland and that the sauce was mismatched. And they are NOT healthy since they are heavily battered and deep fried. The teenager at the table said she liked them. But she didn't finish them.What is NOT over-rated is the french toast sticks. Yummy! We placed a second order. The lemon curd is delicious with the sticks and mixing it with the syrup can make the dish addictive.My Schnitzel was so hard that it was difficult to cut. I had already sent back my bland farmer's tea that tasted like hot water after a 10 minute steep. So I just sawed my way through the under-seasoned/over-cooked cutlet the best way I could. Eventually I gave up and decided to taste it home and season it properly later.The teen really enjoyed her frittata. Her mom's fruit parfait was whipped to perfection. So it's hit or miss.

Not entirely their fault since it was raining outside that day so m assuming all the bugs came inside from the garden, but nevertheless they should have been prepared. Anyway they replaced it pretty quick and apologized a number of times. For appetizers we order beet appetizer which is one of their very popular dishes and i must say totally worth it. Then for main course i had their famous carrots wellington. I have to admit that i have never had a vegetarian wellington before. Perfect combination of the flavor and crispiness. Loved it.

4.0,9/6/2014,"I guess I had lowered expectations for Narcissa, but wow was I pleasantly surprised here. The drinks are tasty, the staff is helpful, the ambiance is very inviting. Honestly I think what won me over was that the complimentary bread is actually served warm and seems to be infused with olive oil and something herbaceous (maybe rosemary?) It's also salt crusted so how can you complain. The namesake salad was certainly fresh and just well executed. I also have a weakness for pistachios and gouda in a salad was also an interesting twist. The crudo did not disappoint but it could have used a touch of acid to really bring out the flavors. The carrot fries seem to be what everyone raves about. They are basically whole farm fresh carrots served tempura style with a wasabi dipping sauce. They are definitely tasty and whimsical so bonus points there. The whole branzino was flat out delicious.  At times with whole fish I find myself begging for some lemon or acid but not the case here at all. It was served fileted and it was undoubtedly well dressed with some micro greens and a not over powering mostarda. The scallops were also cooked with precision. The spicy kale side was ok but I guess the description of spicy was inaccurate for me as it lacked heat. The very slight miscues here and there prevent Narcissa from truly being stellar but I would Definitely go here again.",1,1,1,Yoni Z.,"New York, NY",1,86,0
4.0,9/5/2014,"Only came here for brunch, but I did enjoy my experience a great deal. Everyone I talked to raved about this place, and I can see why. I'm a big fan of Dovetail, and I was happy to see Narcissa open not too far from my apartment.The host at the front was a little frazzled and we actually weren't able to be seated for about 15 minutes. Slightly annoying, but they were very apologetic about the wait, I'll let them have the benefit of the doubt. Waitstaff was very quick with our waters, coffees, and orange juices. Unrealistically quick actually. I was also happy to see an actual full glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, not the shot glass of Tropicana that most places serve.We got an outdoor seat in the back garden area, which was nice, especially since we had just ridden out a slight heat wave and we were just getting a breeze back. I got the burger, which came with fries (at $18, it better come with fries). The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare, and the manchego was melted quite thick up top, and it definitely provided a different texture from a normal burger with cheese. We also got an order of the famed carrot fries, which were basically like large sweet potato fries. Still, they were actually very good, but at $1 a fry, I wouldn't order it again. I also tried my friend's egg white frittata, which was pretty well done. I wouldn't ever order it myself, but I can definitely see white girls lovin' that egg white and vegetable stuff real hard. RULL hard.I'll definitely be back for dinner one of these days.",6,3,2,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

We heard many good things about this place and was expecting it to be top notch. The food tasted great but the portions could have been a bit bigger. The reason for taking off a star is because of the service. For a restaurant like that I would expect the service to be better. It took way too long for the waiter to take our order and we had to ask for our coffees twice because the waiter forgot. Also if you want a coffee refill you better fork out another $5 dollars. I don't think I've ever paid for coffee refills at a restaurant... The food also took a long time coming out.

4.0,8/21/2014,"Narcissa is a lovely and soothing dining experience, at least with regard to the food and atmosphere. We came here for breakfast and asked to be seated in the garden, which is very quiet and whimsical without being over the top. At the server's recommendation, we had the french toast bites. I am not particularly fond of french toast but these were far better than expected or your typical, over-syruped, over-compoted gourmet french toast. They were light and airy and served with several dipping sauces, my favorite of which was the lemon curd. It was SO tart and lemony - I could have eaten spoonfuls of it (maybe I did).I also had the crab salad and added a side of avocado (with sea salt) to it. The flavors worked perfectly together (blood orange, hearts of palm and hazelnuts). The hazelnuts were an especially nice touch and added a necessary crunch. My only knock on this place was that the service was a bit lacking and forced at the same time. They waiter only came about to take our orders, rarely checking in or refilling our waters. When he did take our orders, he was very aggressive and almost insistent on certain items (OK, yes, in the case of the french toast bites, this was a good thing). However, this could very well have been an issue unique to our server.I am looking forward to coming back and trying dinner or drinks soon!",1,0,0,Carina M.,"New York, NY",2,10,2

4.0,8/12/2014,"I came here for a work dinner for the first time not too long ago, but I've walked by Cooper Square / Astor Place so often, and this has always seemed like a pretty popular spot. While you do have an outdoor seating area, along with an open-air bar, there's a much larger seating area - Narcissa is deceptively large in this manner, and it definitely has a 'bigger' feel to it than it would initially suggest. We got seated quickly, and our waiter was a very nice fellow who bantered with us a little, as well as being very upfront about his freshness as a waiter there (barely a month)...much appreciated, as he got the sommelier to give us suggestions on the wine instead of winging it himself.Because we were a bigger party, there's a fixed menu to choose from (not prix fixe, though), so I might not have gotten the full experience - but it was still delicious nonetheless. I started with the barley risotto with clams, and the end result turned out quite impressively. The barley has a heartier, firmer texture to it than arborio rice does, and the leeks give the soupy broth a firm base of flavor. By throwing in several littleneck clams, it almost feels like you're eating a lighter version of clam chowder with a bit more texture to it - very unique way of combining two dishes and having it come out really well. I went with the special for the evening, which was pork two ways. One of the presentations was in sausage form, which, while good, didn't blow me away and wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected. The second was as a filet, and that was absolutely phenomenal; each bite was firm and full of flavor, but without the fattiness that I usually associate with eating pork. I really enjoyed that, and it was definitely the highlight of the dinner for me. I ended the meal with the summer sundae, which was really good - light flavors, nothing too heavy - but by this point, I was already a few drinks in, and I honestly forget the details!Although I was a bit disappointed in the beer selection (and the ad-hoc replacement of Ballast Point Sculpin with Brooklyn IPA), overall I had a very enjoyable experience here. With food reasonably priced, especially for NYC, and a laid-back vibe indicative of its East Village surroundings, I'd definitely want to come back at some point in time.",1,0,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

I have gone there several times now and it only gets better - the menu is more of a share plate menu which i love because you get to really create your own tasting menu.  The duck is to die for - the rips in yogurt are a must have - the carrot fries get a lot of hype but really are just a filler - so i would stay away from ordering them ... the rotisserie branzino is delish - they have an amazing wine list and give great recommendations on wine pairings.  The ambience is nice - i prefer sitting at the chefs table which is similar to sitting at a sushi bar - you really get to experience the art that goes into creating each dish.  Save room for dessert because their pastry chef is fab! The hosts are not the most professional - but you completely forget about them once you sit down and are consumed by the greatness of the service and food.

4.0,8/2/2014,"What a beautiful space-- both indoor and out! When we were exploring the village on another day and passed by The Standard, we noticed a large number of people dining on the street. We neglected to make brunch reservations, and we were worried that we wouldn't get in. The good things-- 1) the restaurant on the street is NOT Narcissa (keep walking in..) and 2) we were able to not only get a seat-- but a table outdoors!The outdoor space feels like someone's large backyard, with a mixture of sun and shade. Our server explained that brunch had only started a few weeks earlier-- surprising as the space feels like a perfect place to spend a Sunday afternoon. Our server also explained to us this odd law that booze could not be served before 11-- we were there a few minutes earlier than that-- which struck me as odd, coming from San Francisco, but we went with it. The food was amazingly delightful-- light but satiating. We had French toast bites to start and various egg dishes-- all delightful. I had eggs benedict with heirloom tomatoes, while my boyfriend had crab benedict. We ordered the carrot fries, which we had to ask for (probably the only serving snafu we encountered) but they were worth the wait-- fried and accompanied with a dipping sauce- yum!Since I have been on a Mezcal kick, the ""Fly Me to Tulum"", featuring Mezcal, Tequila, Pomegranate and Chili-- was the perfect hit of spice to make sure I was awake.The bathroom situation is also cool-- if you've never been the Standard. Modern, mirrored single-stalls. A bit of a trek from Narcissa, but worth getting lost and finding your way.

This experience was really 4.5 stars, with stellar food across the board and a beautiful spring outdoor ambience, but slightly uneven service. And the latter was fine, just somewhat disjointed.Waiting was the sticking point here, as was the erroneous dish delivery for my friend... But this was negated by the pleasant patio, and what arrived as sheer food bliss. We started with the mini bagel crisps with assorted spreads... The lox was my favorite. I then had the poached eggs and avocado toast with watercress salad. A dish of perfection that--combined with the weather--transported me back to Los Angeles for the duration of the meal. My friend ordered the ramp frittata, which was initially preempted by the broccoli cheddar (great as well, as I snuck a bite), before she returned it for the equally pleasant original order.

We showed up wayyy early to our reservation, so I apologize for that. What a terrible thing to do. We wanted to check out the bar though, so that was why we showed up early. Our reservation was for 9:30 that evening but I made it very, very clear that if there was an earlier seat, I would really appreciate if we could be seated a tad earlier. So we're sitting at the bar and I see streams of guests, ranging from parties of 2, to 3, to even 4 getting seated during this time. In the beginning I thought: alright those must be the 9:00pm reservation folks. Nbd. But then around 9:25, I'm like... yo so.... Is this thing happening? The ppl being seated around this time didn't look rushed or hurried at all, they were casually sauntering in as if their reservation was for ....9:30. By now I'm a little irritated so I walk up and ask the B-side Morpheus working at the front if our table is ready. He remarked and assured us that we would ""definitely be seated on time."" Flash forward to 9:50 and I'm just pissed off. I show up early for this reservation, and you're brazen enough to not only 1. Guarantee that my reservation time is honored and 2. Seat OTHERS who just walked in after me for the same time slot? Who are you? I'm looking at you, Morpheus doppleganger. Lookin' at you.That annoying part aside the rest of the dining experience was perfect. So yea, OOPS.

We ordered the beets and crab salad, along with the duck and lamb. All four dishes were excellent and very unique texturally--they were inventive without trying too hard. My only complaint would be the presentation. It's pretty awful. Just go click on some of the pictures and you'll see how sloppy everything is slapped together. But that aside, definitely come check this place out. It's worth it.",2,3,1,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1

The music inside is great too. Probably one of the better places I've been to in NY since I moved here four years ago...and that's saying a lot - I am a foodie! Try the steak or lamb osubucco.

4.0,6/8/2014,"Could be my new favorite place to eat!  We came for Sunday brunch. The decor inside was modern, comfortable, open and welcoming. The menu was phenomenal - never had I had such a hard time choosing what to order! We shared the eggs benedict (because it's usually what I want on a Sunday) and the pork schnitzel. Both were perfection! Both dishes came with salad (as opposed to potatoes, which is a good thing because it's less carbs, less guilt :) )And you know when you can't decide whether to get something salty or sweet for brunch? Problem solved with a side order of French toast bites served with lemon curd and maple syrup - genius! The price was reasonable, actually great for the quality of the food and the warm attentive service.

4.0,5/28/2014,"I want to start this review by saying the carrots Wellington was by far the worst dish we had last night....wtf people???!!! I went for those juicy little raved about bits alone!!! I had a 7:30 rese after many attempts to eat here and thinking at the time of booking both 5:30 and 10:00 seemed like acceptable times to enjoy dinner...not so much. I arrived early and sat at the bar. The bartender was great! I ordered a totally fab drink,  the gentleman farmer...order it, it's like getting your veges and booze all in one shot, the essentials!  We decided that we were digging the bar vibe so we stayed at the bar instead of sitting at a table. Like most hotel restaurants, no matter how cool, they can't dodge that hotel restaurant vibe. We basically wanted to order the entire menu so here's the rundown:1. Brussels sprouts leaves with greens and things - best salad I've had in forever2. Long Island fluke crudo broccoli pesto lemon and pine nuts - not a huge fan of crudo and I could have eaten another order...YUM.3. Poached farm egg quinoa forest mushroom chayote - unbelievably fantastic4. Rotisserie crisped beets bulgar salad apples creamed horseradish - meh...5. Carrots Wellington - people, here is where ya let me down....so underwhelmed and disappointed...mushy tasteless carrots surrounded by a croissant ...fail.6. Roasted hake artichokes clementines - I say you stick with the apps, they were outstanding and the mains were pretty anticlimactic ..7. Carrot fries - oh I tasted these on the way out as I stopped by my ex lovahs table as he was enjoying dinner with a date...yep, I did that : ) order themThe wine list is interesting, we tried the Bebame 2012 Cab Franc/Gamay and although it went well with the food, it's a little light on it's own.

It's hands down a great place to eat for a great price. Cocktails are banging and the food is so tasty and ""texture"" based.The grilled beets and the roasted potatoes were heavenly. We also got the cod and the duck. The duck was really good and very filling (note very different from Chinese style duck) - more savory and less crispy BUT fatty for sure. But hands down the cod was the best for presentation, flavor and butter-ness.For girls: Fly Me to Tulum is a great cocktail and I can't remember the name of the one I got but it had a splash of ginger beer and it was very refreshing but in an old man's taste buds kinda way.

She is a vegetarian, and it found this restaurant to be amazing for both vegetarians and carnivores like me!I will agree with the crowd here that the carrot fries are worth passing on. But you're a crazy person if you don't get that delicious gnocchi! I got the lacquered duck, which was perfectly prepared, fun to eat, and complex. But I think the Carrot Wellington was the highlight of the night. The flavor packed into that dish is amazing. My only problem with my experience was with the sommelier.

5.0,5/25/2014,"The absolute best new restaurant in New York City.Every new restaurant in NYC should use Narcissa as an example in terms of how to plan a menu, design a space, and manage their staff. Every single thing I sampled on the menu during my two dinner experiences here was exceptional. The staff is friendly, informed, professional, and balletic. The space is beautiful.Narcissa does the farm-to-table thing, with a nice, sparkling emphasis on vegetables, without pretension. And I never felt like I was eating a ""mission statement."" The cocktails are exemplary (and much better than at Cafe Standard, the pretty bar next door with a different cocktail list). Every dish kept outdoing the other one, and this isn't a restaurant to skip dessert. The sundae is the best dessert I've ever had, ever.John Fraser is a talented chef who takes his cooking seriously. Given the open kitchen situation, he might want to tone down laying into his line cooks during the dinner service, but I would come back again and again, and I've recommended it to others, who all loved it as well. I'm grateful it's here.Narcissa, while extremely sophisticated eating, doesn't reflect that on their prices.

5.0,5/7/2014,"This is the best new restaurant in NYC. I had dinner at Narcissa and the food was excellent. I ordered the rotisserie crisped beets and the bone-in prime ribeye. The beets were great and are served in a horseradish cream sauce. I enjoyed it but if you don't like the taste of horseradish it can seem overpowering. The ribeye was the best I've had in years. It was slow roasted to a perfect medium rare and it was juicy, flavorful and tender. Amazing. This is a must order. The sea salt potatoes were very good. Compliments of the Chef,  I was also able to try potato gnocchi and the Brussels sprouts leaves and the potato gnocchi were fabulous. They were both light and rich at the same time. So good. The Make Me Pretty cocktail was tasty.This is a great place for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike to come together and live as one as the chef has created a veggie heavy menu and has managed to not alienate meat and fish lovers. The service was impeccable and the ambiance was perfect. I'm actually plotting my next return here so I can try the baked oysters, the steamed black bass and the carrot fries.

The brunch menu was awesome- started with the bagels and schmear's classic NYC- the smoked salmon one was my favorite.I had the crab salad as my main- it is a small plate- so i got sad BUT it was so filling and rich that I was totally full. My eyes lied to me!I decided to come back with some fancy friends on a triple date- i feel like we basically ordered the whole menu and 2 drinks each. The dishes I will dream about during the cold winter months : the rotisserie beets- yum yum yum, the preparation makes them meaty and filling- a must order. The carrot fries were awesome- but i would eat anything deep fried in tempura. My favorite main dishes were the duck and the bass in a curry sauce. Sad we didnt get the steak- but i guess next time.

4.0,4/6/2014,"Enter Narcissa, yet another one of the most anticipated openings of 2014. A successful partnership between Chef John Fraser (of Michelin-starred Dovetail) and André Balazs ensured Narcissa a spot in The Standard Hotel. A lesser-known fact, is that Balazs' Hudson Valley farm, Locusts on Hudson, is the source of the organic produce served daily. It's another strong knot in the relationship between restaurant and hotel, and a testament to the growth of the farm-to-table movement. With such strong foundations as well as a slew of positive early reviews, it soon became nearly impossible to reserve a table. Thankfully, planning in advance paid off, and a few friends and I made our way over on an early Sunday evening.At first glance, Narcissa bears almost no resemblance to Dovetail. The restaurant has a modern, upbeat ambiance, with two separate dining areas. We walked through the first, bordering the patio entrance, and were led into the second room, which has an unhindered view of the kitchen. After being seated, we started going through the menu, attempting to make the best selections for the evening. Our server was able to answer questions we had on several dishes and made note that we wanted to share our appetizer plates.To start off with: The Rotisserie-Crisped Beets utilize one of the most unique preparations of this root vegetable that you'll find. Here, they're slow and low-roasted whole for five hours, and paired with a bulgar salad, cucumber slices, and a horseradish cream. As bizarre and discordant as the elements sound, the very contrast is what make it a success. The beets, crisp on the outside, moist and tender on the interior, impart a startingly earthy, almost meaty, flavor which is cut through neatly by the zest of horseradish and cucumber. Our second appetizer, the Short Ribs, similarly impressed with its fall-off-the-fork tenderness. While the pastrami spices used were very faint, the slices of radish and cabbage worked perfectly with the buttermilk sauce, creating yet another contrasting success.We opted for our own mains, and with some difficulty, I decided on the Lamb Loin. Narcissa pairs two cuts of loin with a thin and crisp spinach pie (a variant to the traditional ones served in Greek restaurants), sautéed piquillo peppers, and cauliflower. At first glance, the dish bears a striking resemblance to a forest scene, helped by the herb-tinted covering of breadcrumbs across the lamb. While a simple dish, a meticulous amount of detail went into each element and the vegetables, well-seasoned and cooked to the right tenderness, received just as much attention as the protein.It would be a travesty to leave Narcissa without trying the desserts, especially with Deborah Racicot (formerly of Gotham Bar & Grill and Red Rooster) behind these creations, so we finally agreed on the Winter Sundae. It initially appears to be a hodge podge of cacophonous ingredients: olive oil ice cream, meyer lemon curd, and whipped cream. The ice cream, at first taste, bears little resemblance to olive oil, but is surprisingly light and refreshing, without being overly sweet. It's the perfect middle ground between the sweeter, thicker lemon curd and the lighter whipped cream, which has hints of lemon and thyme throughout. The serving was generous, too, and more than enough to split between the three of us.For those that are curious about Narcissa, I'll say this: Go. Here, taste and flavor are not sacrificed for the loftier principles of being ""farm to table"" or ""organic"". Tables may be difficult to reserve nowadays, especially after the recent slew of publicity, but dining on an off-hour is a small price to pay for a chance to try the dishes here.--Additional Notes:[1] Narcissa's name is taken from one of the cows raised at Locusts on Hudson.[2] The complimentary bread is made to order, and served right out of the oven. Don't be shy about asking for seconds; it's that good.",22,11,20,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
4.0,3/28/2014,"First off, Narcissa has a great atmosphere and excellent vibe. It's rather large, which is deceiving since it doesn't appear that way from outside. Once you walk in there is seating to the left and to the right, and a chef's counter where diners can watch the chefs working their magic. Definitely a ""hot spot"". It was completely packed on a Thursday night, the entire place buzzing.I had the pleasure of sitting at the counter, where the chefs are not shy to engage in conversation and ask how the dishes are. I love that interaction and it makes it fun to see them excel at their craft. John Fraser was in the house expediting and keeping a close eye on every aspect of his restaurant. Needless to say it is a well oiled machine. I was amazed at how they managed to quickly churn out the dishes with extreme precision amid the ""organized chaos"" of a busy restaurant. The teamwork was a real joy to watch as they were all on the same page and you could here ""Oui Chef!"" several times throughout the night as Fraser was barking out orders.. One crab salad, one beet, one short rib.I've had Fraser's food at Dovetail and while it was solid I wasn't wowed. The food here is much more approachable yet still refined. My order was:Dungeness crab salad- Interesting dish. Nice presentation of a generous pile of extremely fresh, sweet flaked Dungeness crab intermingled with lots of chopped hazelnuts and blood orange segments. Sweet, crunchy, acidic, nutty. A nice light start to the meal.The kitchen sent out the already famed rotisserie beets and one of the chefs winked and said ""Benefits of sitting at the counter"". I had considered ordering the beets so this was a nice treat. The skin of the beets had a nice crispy char and the innards were sweet a you'd expect. There was some nice apple and bulgar wheat and the whole thing was sitting in a pool of horseradish (which they like to use here). It was perfectly fine but honestly it was not something I'd order again.Barley risotto with clams ad garlic- Easily the best savory dish of the night in my opinion. The texture of the risotto was textbook. So creamy, soft yet still properly toothsome with a bite. The clams were not chewy at all and perfectly cooked. The surprise here is the power that the chilies had. Packed a really spicy and surprising punch. Delicious and a must order.Lamb loin with piquillo peppers, olives, cauliflower- The dish I was looking most forward to was solid, yet feel a step short. It evoked flavors of Spain and Greece. Lamb was cooked rare as ordered, however the crust on it (something with horseradish or maybe wasabi) was so overpowering that I couldn't get that gamey taste I truly love in lamb. I enjoy spicy but that wasabi flavor turns me off as it overpowers almost everything you apply it to. Best thing on the plate was the lamb belly and the little spinach pie was also terrific. This was a saving grace.Winter sundae- Debra Racicot is an absolute pastry genious. Her resume speaks for itself. Low and behold, she was there at the chef's counter making all the desserts herself. I saw her crafting this beautiful sundae and felt like a kid in a candy store. Everything you want in a sundae. Perfect components, which is hard to accomplish and an art when making a sundae. All the flavors have to work without it being overkill and just having one sweet mishmash of crap. This contained 3 scoops of olive oil ice cream, lemon curd, cherries, some crunchy bits, and lemon thyme whipped cream. It had some sweet, some salty, some tart, really superb. Maybe best thing I had all night.I really enjoyed the dinner and experience. Side note- The bone-in ribeye looked spectacular and I want to come back for that. Props to Fraser and Racicot for being in house and active in the process.",1,0,0,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798
5.0,3/23/2014,"After hearing such good things about Narcissa from Eater, Grub Street, and, of course, Yelp, I had to try it for myself.  Chef John Fraser (chef from Dovetail) continues to impress. We started out with 2 appetizers - Rotisserie Crisped Beets and Beef Short Ribs. I generally steer clear of vegetables for appetizers except brussel sprouts, but I'm glad I decided to go on an adventurous limb and try the beets. It was my first time eating beets and now I'm sure that it won't be the last. The beets were crispy and had great texture. The hint of horseradish went really well with the tangy, sweet beets. The short ribs are a must! Although the price for 2 slices of short rib at $15 seems a bit steep, it's totally worth it! The ribs were so tender it practically melts in your mouth. The creamy sauce that the ribs bathe in is a good dip for the complimentary bread that they serve. The bread was phenomenal and still steaming when the waiter served it to us! Perfectly crusted with salt and rosemary, I felt like I could have an entire meal of the bread alone!For the entrees, we ordered the baby chicken, lacquered duck breast, and lamb loin. For dinner entree items ranging in the $25-$30 region (except for the Bone-In Prime Ribeye at $48), the portions were reasonable and filling. The baby chicken came in a pot with a variety of vegetables. The meat of the baby chicken was so tender, it fell off the bones easily.  The truffle broth was a nice touch. The lamb loin, cooked at the chef's choice of medium, was juicy and delicious. For $26, two chunks of lamb loin seem expensive, but again, it was so phenomenally cooked that it was worth it. The lacquered duck breast had to be my favorite. Cooked at the chef's choice of medium, the meat was tender. There was a thin layer of duck fat between the crispy seasoned skin and the meat that made for a great combination of textures. The meat was juicy and the cranberries and cranberry sauce were a good addition to the flavors on the plate, which also included mashed butternut squash and pear. I loved how the sweet flavors of these components meshed with the rich, salty flavor of the duck breast. Finally, even though we were already really full, we decided to order a dessert to share. We ordered the Winter Sundae for dessert, which was a delectable combination of olive oil ice cream, lemon thyme whipped cream, cherries, and lemon curd. The olive oil ice cream on its own could be a bit overwhelming, but the tanginess of the lemon curd and lightness of the whipped cream made it a solid dessert. There was also some salt sprinkled in there that did a good job of balancing out the sweet and sour flavors. Overall, I had a really positive experience and would definitely recommend this place. And since they take reservations, there's even more of a reason to take out that special someone or finally plan that dinner get-together with friends.",8,0,2,Morgan W.,"San Carlos, CA",830,82,573

3.0,3/19/2014,"The moment I heard that John Fraser was opening a new restaurant, it immediately jumped to the top of my ""must try"" list.  After two meals at the chef's Dovetail, as well as a dinner at his ""What Happens When"" pop-up, I was hooked on his delicate manipulation of simple ingredients.  So, when my friend and I were in need of a restaurant for a recent dinner, Narcissa instantly came to mind.  I struggled to find a reservation on OpenTable and was able to squeeze in a 6:00 pm slot on a Monday.  Though I had tried to delay the seating as that particular day arrived, I was confronted with no other options.  However, I was not about to give up my dining opportunity, even if I had to eat earlier than usual.Upon my arrival, though, I was shocked to notice that the restaurant was about 98% empty.  I met my friend at the bar and allowed the polished and friendly bartender to guide me through their glasses of white wine.  After allowing me to sample a few, which I was not particularly fond of, he guided me to Albarino perfection.  While I sipped the crisp nectar, the hostess approached us to see if we were ready to be seated.  We requested some extra time, which she initially seemed willing to provide.  After about 15 minutes, she reappeared to advise that we really should take our seats or run the risk of losing them...to whom, I have no idea, since the restaurant was still pretty dead.  Well, we decided to humor her and allowed ourselves to be escorted passed the busy, open kitchen and into the dining room.The minute we sat down, our server preyed on us like a hungry bear.  He was intense, fidgety, and with an accent that continually shifted from Midwestern to Australian and others.  I was pretty surprised that his bizarre demeanor was accepted by such a regarded team at the helm.   Despite the awkward service, the cuisine was rather tasty, but not as flawless or as impressive as I had hoped.  The menu sounded amazing and deliberating over it distracted us from inhaling our salty, herbaceous loaf of artisan sourdough.  We finally settled on a few dishes and began to catch up over the intoxicating comfort of warm bread.  We started with the Poached Farm Egg appetizer.  The presentation on this one wow'ed us more than the flavor.  The server approached the table with two bowls - one a dry mixture of mushrooms, quinoa, and chayote, while the other balanced an open sous vide egg like a delicate wedding band on top of a pillow.  The egg was lightly poured onto the quinoa bowl and left for us to slice open and blend.  While the mushrooms and chayote enhanced the flavor of the dish, the egg lacked any real seasoning and would have benefited from some salt and pepper.  The main courses were an improvement, though.  My Roasted Hake was cooked to a flaky perfection and placed over artichokes, clementines, endive, and an olive tapenade.  There were a lot of acidic elements to this course that really enhanced the flavor of the fish.  My friend's Lamb Loin was rich, moist, and crusted with some sort of pesto.  It was served with a greasy, but tasty spinach pie, piquillo peppers, and roasted cauliflower.  She enjoyed the dish, but was turned off by a fatty piece of braised lamb belly that was also included on the plate, and which I gladly finished for her.  Our side of Sunchokes and Red Cabbage was sweet and earthy, but very oily.  While we had contemplated a dessert order, we decided to just call it a night, but were still gifted ""a taste of something sweet"", which included melt-in-your-mouth dark chocolate mocha truffles and citrus jellies.If someone suggested Narcissa for another meal, I would gladly return, but I think there are better experiences to be had, such as at Hearth, only a few blocks Northeast.",3,2,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

Service was impeccable and they were incredibly attentive and thoughtful. Started with the oysters which were delicious. Oysters perfectly baked and the crumb delivered as a tasty contrast. The lamb was cooked perfectly but was nothing out of this world. The roast chicken could have been out of this world - comforting, delicious and downright craveable. Unfortunately it was a tad heavy on the salt for us. Still - we would be willing to give it another visit should we get a chicken and truffle broth craving. 3 stars on this visit.",0,0,0,Alvin S.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

5.0,3/3/2014,"I am not sure I can adequately describe how wonderful this experience was.   I took my husband there on a Saturday night for his 40th birthday.   Making the reservation was easy.  I did it online and they sent back a personal email confirming.  I even mentioned in the email back it was a special occasion and they said they'd add a special touch at dessert (which they fulfilled BTW with a candle on his dessert).  We arrived at 6:30 and were greeted and seated quickly.  The atmosphere was very comfortable.   Our appetizers of brussels sprout salad and raw tuna were delicious.  We then followed up with main courses of the scallops with squash and beets and the duck with squash and cranberries.   As a side, we had the carrot fries.  ONE WORD FOR IT ALL - ""DIVINE""  - I wanted it to last all night and truly tried to savor every bite. We also both enjoyed cocktails and a dessert.  A superb dinner with superb service.  I am almost a little mad there is nothing to critique about this place... only that they were too efficient and I wanted it to last longer, oh and finding the bathroom is a little tricky : )  Next time in NYC, I'm definitely going back for more.",2,1,2,Nicole B.,"New Hope, PA",14,28,19

4.0,2/17/2014,"Best Bite(s): Jerk Sweet Potato, Short Rib, Winter Truffle Broth + Bread, Toasted Fennel CheesecakeFEB 17, 2014 - Word coming from the Standard Hotel is that Narcissa is well worth going to. With a Michelin-starred chef, two beautiful dining rooms and an accessible farm-to-table theme, it's easy to see the appeal. I dropped by last Sunday for an early dinner.The menu is broken out into three sections (apps, mains and sides) with an emphasis on roasting, rotisserie and slow cooking. You'll find many veggie-friendly apps that take advantage of the chefs inclination to roast, and a wide variety of proteins for you to choose as your main (duck, lamb, hake, branzino, bass, pig, ribeye, etc.).I'd already been informed it would be a mistake to skip the rotisserie sweet potato with jerk spices, peppers and tofu aioli - very wise advice. The charred potatoes have the perfect level jerk seasoning, but the rest of the dish is really quite light. The butter lettuce, crispy potato skins, chickpeas and aioli provide a fresh counterpoint to the assertive potatoes to arrive at a pleasant balance of flavors.The other appetizer featured two perfectly cooked pieces of beef short rib with pastrami spices, cabbage, radish and buttermilk. This dish read well on the menu, and really came through on the tasting. The crusted pastrami spices were subtle, but present, the buttermilk was a clever, somewhat tart sauce in place of something creamier, and the accompanying choice of vegetables brought necessary brightness, freshness and texture to the plate.When it came to the mains, I needed to order the baby chicken. With rotisserie expertise and locally-sourced, organic proteins, it felt it almost obligatory to go in this direction. The chicken is broken down before serving, and placed amid carrots, brussels sprouts and spiced sausage. When it hit the table, our server poured over a fragrant winter truffle broth that laid the flavor foundation for every bite of the dish. It was earthy, homey, and delicate all at once. Also, I highly encourage you to save that broth and use your complimentary bread to soak it up.Our regrettable side dish choice was the kohlrabi with fine herbs. This was easily the biggest misstep, as it was extremely salty for some reason. Not sure if it was heavy-handed seasoning or a over-reduced glaze/sauce, but in our opinion, it was inedible.Our second main was a flaky piece of hake served over tapenade for brine, complemented by artichoke, clementine and endive. Definitely the cleanest dish of the night, highlighted by well-selected notes of sweet, bitter, and salty.With some room left for dessert, we opted for the toasted fennel chessecake, which I would consider another can't-miss item. Not only does the light cheesecake have just the right amount of anise flavor, but the grapefruit, sorbet and pomegranate seeds also have thin ribbons of fennel over-top that reinforce the savory undertones throughout. Not entirely sure where the chartreuse was (yellow color of the cheesecake? ribbons steeped in it?), but I'm not complaining.Wrapping Up...It clearly hasn't taken Narcissa very long to hit its stride. While the kohlrabi was an unpleasant bump in the road, the meal was otherwise pretty flawless. Chef Jonn Fraser seems to have an excellent handle on blending the warmth of rotisserie and roasting with the right accents to give dishes real levity, depth and cohesiveness. Would definitely recommend grabbing a seat before Pete Wells signals his approval. Enjoy!",5,1,1,Jacob Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,77
1.0,2/8/2014,"I'm torn because up until they asked us to get up mid-drink post a huge (and expensive) dinner to make room for one of the bartenders friends, I would have said food was solid; good value for your money and pleasant space. But I was dumbfounded and quite speechless when one of the 4 bartenders interrupted our conversation and asked us to leave to make room for his friends at the bar... I can't, in good conscious, give the restaurant any stars. And although the guy offered to buy us drinks for getting up, it was too late, the good vibes were broken. instead we declined, gulped our drinks and left. If you don't know how to treat your customers, it doesn't matter how great everything else is. I wouldn't recommend. So many places with good food and great customer service. Sadly, this one's not it.",8,0,0,suzy d.,"Manhattan, NY",1,27,1
4.0,2/5/2014,"Bowery trendy with delicious food and overstaffed as it just opened. We were party of four so got to try a good cross section of foods and all were special. Can't go wrong on whatever you order. Cocktail list was also good.However, It's ok not to allow you to bring your own wine, but then you must provide a good wine list both in selection and value. They don't.  Had the cabernet franc by the glass as my only hopeful choice, tasted like red zin, awful. They also have old California wines, which don't age well, and who knows where sourced. Rest of list was also poor with nothing of note or value, so we couldn't enjoy a good bottle of wine. Sommelier didn't seem to care much--so loses a big star. Also pours are not standard 5-6 oz, more like 3oz in a small glass hopelessly designed to make the pour look larger.",1,1,0,Wine M.,"New York, NY",2,93,4
4.0,2/3/2014,"This place is a little odd for the neighborhood. It feels more like Tribecca or Chelsea. But that aside, especially on a nite like this when you'd rather not have to travel across town, a little Tribecca in East Village might be a nice idea. I think I've never found an interior quite so perfectly orchestrated. The staff go through the motions so gracefully that I almost looked for a conductor. The kitchen clearly takes itself seriously with pride. Every sauce was scientifically excuted with perfection. Temperature of everything perfect as well.

4.0,1/31/2014,"In spite of the fact that I was reading a lot about the heavy use of vegetables in some of the good dishes here, I still wanted to come. The hyped Carrot Fries and other starters and entrees were just as delicious as they were beautiful.The best thing about this new restaurant in the Standard Hotel though is the gorgeous dining room and the swanky atmosphere. It is a really classy and trendy vibe, and is quite dark, yet at the same time there is a feeling of brightness on the table, aided by the real candles (not fake electric candles, or even the small candles, but actual long, full candles), which made me nervous continually that a server was going to catch on fire whenever bringing or clearing plates.And the servers did come over constantly, with perfect and attentive service throughout the meal. Our water was repeatedly filled and plates and the table were cleaned efficiently between each course. As for the courses, most of the food was really delicious:- BreadThe complimentary bread they start you off with is really great. It's like a large bun cut into 4 pieces and is served with butter and salt. It is nice and oily, and is good enough on its own without the butter. Do not decline when they ask if you want more.- Rotisserie-crisped Beets ($12)Who knew beets could taste so good? I sure didn't. But I do now. I think it was all about that creamed horseradish that the four pieces of beets were swimming in. This is a delicious healthier (not quite healthy because of that excellent creamy sauce) option to start the meal with.- Beef Short Rib ($15)Quite similar in appearance to the beet dish, but even more amazing since it's beef instead of just vegetables. You get two generous-sized hunks of short rib, and a third, little piece, of mostly fat. Like that delicious creamed horseradish with the beets, the beef short ribs in this dish are accompanied by an excellent creamy polenta. With both of these dishes, make sure you lick those plates clean. Every last vegetable and bit of sauce is delicious (and pricey).- Lamb Loin ($26)Definitely the better of the two entrees, this was really great. Not only was this the best-tasting bite of the night, but it was also the most beautiful dish. The two juicy, red pieces of lamb, placed alongside the excellent spinach pie and a really fatty, crispy, thick piece of bacon, made for a really nice-looking plate. Those little perfectly juicy medallions of lamb were incredible, and made me wish they gave you more than just two little pieces for the $26 price tag.- Heritage Milk-fed Pig ($32)This was probably the wrong choice for me, as I am not one of those that likes biting into the pure fat of pork belly. If that is your thing though, you will probably love this, as there are two incredibly fatty hunks of porchetta, with really crispy, fatty edges. The actual meat part of the pork was delicious, but there wasn't much as it was dominated by the layer of fat. The broccoli rabe and beans were pretty tasty, but at $32, this one stung since I didn't eat all of that fat.- Carrot Fries ($7)This side is the thing I kept reading about prior to coming here. I don't quite see what all the hubbub is about, but they are pretty tasty; impressively crispy and flavorful, along with the creamy dipping sauce. So yes, go with the hype and get these, they are worth trying.Portions were understandably smaller as this is a classy place, so we easily had room for two desserts (I wanted three, but wanted to avoid embarrassment):- Toasted Fennel Cheesecake ($9)I was not really a fan of this one at all, and it definitely looked way nicer than it tasted. I don't think grapefruit has any business in a good dessert, which was easily confirmed with this one. There are a couple chunks of grapefruit, along with a little scoop of grapefruit sorbet. I usually like to get a bite of cake along with the ice cream/sorbet, but this sorbet just kind of ruined the flavor of the bite. Eaten separately, the cheesecake was ok, but nothing like a good cheesecake you would expect, as it was a little too soft and not nearly dense enough.- Parsnip-carrot Cake ($9)Another impressively plated item, this one did taste as cool as it looked. Not quite as grand-looking as the delicious beast of a slice at Carbone, this rendition of carrot cake still does hold its own and is a delicious way to end the meal. Strangely cut up into three wedges of cake, with the cream cheese icing piped all over the plate in thin strips, with an extra little dollop of icing on the side of the plate, it was hard to tell what I was looking at at first. None of that really matters though once you take a bite of the incredibly moist cake, combined with the smooth cream cheese frosting.The food was all good, but I wasn't really blown away by anything, which I expect to be for $30+ entrees. The menu supposedly changes frequently, so I wouldn't mind coming back when the weather gets warm and the nice outdoor garden is open.",25,10,13,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1695,69834
5.0,1/31/2014,"Birthdays bring magical things. And this year, it brought a most-coveted reservation for two at John Fraser and André Balazs' new restaurant in The Standard. Open to the public barely four days, coming off a quietly led friends and family run, Narcissa was humming with warm energy that this space has lacked for many years. Formerly the Cooper Square Hotel's ground floor bar, the space now is completely unrecognizable, filled with soft light, smooth wood accents, lace curtains and fairly large and gorgeous open kitchen. To start, the staff here is impeccable in their service, hospitality and recommendations. Our server brought the sommelier straight away, and he recommended the 2010 Wind Gap Syrah, from Sonoma, a red that went surprisingly well with event the lightest dishes. As he decanted it for us, we sipped a few cocktails, mine a version of a classic gimlet with gin and basil, my partner's a smokey mezcal and tequila mix rimmed in light salt spices. Both balanced and smooth, light and refreshing. The dishes are really an absolute dream. When the chef and the owner cart in produce and meat and other ingredients from the owner's farm upstate, there's a noticeable difference in quality, taste, texture and in preparation. We began with the dungeness crabs salad with blood oranges dressed in homemade mayo. What's really interesting is how the tart citrus, the crunch of nuts and the meaty, rich crab meat play together. For dinner, we chose the rotisserie branzino and the bass, both extremely different. The branzino was served completely deboned, light, with hearts of palm and fresh greens, while the bass was simmered in curry and served in a clay pot. The curry was creamy and hinted at spice,  with absolutely no heat. Each fish was delicately cooked, clean in flavor and simple in presentation. Dessert kept pace with the entire experience thus far: an indulgent, grown up version of an ice cream sundae, with olive oil ice cream, fruit-and-nut crisps with little hints of sea salt in every other bite, topped off with just about the freshest, creamiest whipped cream I've ever had. Sipping chamomile tea and polishing off that ice cream left me and partner completely sated, a little tipsy and filled with that rare, wonderful feeling that only a perfect meal will give you.The menu changes near daily, and John Fraser can often be found speaking with guests about their experience in the dining rooms. As the seasons change, as will the menu and a constant opportunity to taste what the chef deems fresh and fit for his menu at the time. As the weather warms up, patrons have al fresco dining to look forward to, if in fact they are able to get a reservation. I'll be one of those who will back as often as possible, if not only to see what surprises the menu holds.",25,4,13,Leighann F.,"New York, NY",3214,961,695
