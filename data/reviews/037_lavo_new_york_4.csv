3.0,4/23/2019,"Keep in mind that this review is coming from a girl on a budget. If I had money coming out of my booty hole, then I would probably give this restaurant 4 stars. Surprisingly, there was no wait for a party of 2 on a Friday night and the hostess let us seat ourselves. Ordered the salami and cheese board to start with (nothing spectacular). Many reccommend the giant meatball appetizer if you're okay with spending $29 on ONE meatball. For our entreé, my boyfriend and I opted to share the ""large"" portion of the papardelle. It was very good, but portions are definitely on the smaller side. Since we weren't hungry to begin with, it was enough food for the both of us. However, had I come on an empty stomach, we probably would've had to order our own separate dishes. Overall, good food, but expect to spend some $$$ here.",1,1,1,Krystal L.,"Manalapan Township, NJ",119,55,160

1.0,4/19/2019,Really bad quality food. That this restaurant is a sister restaurant to Tao is not surprising. They both suck big time! The mushroom polenta was a goopy solid unappetizing blob on a plate. I struggled to finish it. The bread for the table sucked equally - such poor quality. I've had much better at a quarter of the price these jokers charge. Avoid at all costs.,0,0,0,Babu M.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

5.0,4/15/2019,"The meatball alone was amazinggggggg. Having a foodgasm thinking about it right now 10/10 !!! We started with the baked clams and meatball, the baked clams are always good. I got the penne seafood alredo, the scallops were succulent and the shrimps were tasty, but the dish itself was a little salty. The meatball was so good that when my entree came I no longer had an appetite for alfredo. Alfredo 8/10 though. My homie got the spaghetti carbonara she liked it. Our doggy bags got mixed up so I ate hers the next day, and it was good. Spaghetti Carbonara 7/10.

1.0,4/14/2019,"We stood here for about 10 minutes and this establishment let in White people without asking them to commit to a minimum of $200! In fact the door men greeted those people with respect and welcomed then in. In contrast, my black friend and I were treated with suspicion and investigated. The rude door man asked for a two hundred dollar minimum to get in. Very surprising and racist because apparently they assumed black patrons wouldn't spend money here? This is very surprising because we were dressed impeccably! So in summary, this is a racist and classist establishment that demands a spending minimum from their black patrons while the white patrons are let in with respect and no questions asked! Very sad and unfortunately that an establishment in one of the most diverse cities in the world has the audacity to treat its patrons like that!

He made recommendations and explained the difference between menu items past their descriptions, even considered we were sharing and one pasta could carry us as a whole vs adding pasta to every plate.  I always the food and meal were amazing when you're stuffed and still looking at the dessert menu!  I never repeat restaurants on the same trip but am actually considering Lavo again because of how impressed I was with Leka's attention to detail and sense of humor.  10 stars out of 5!!!

1.0,3/12/2019,"i went in for lunch and had prefix menu. after i ask if i could substitute the dessert for another appetizer the waitor gave me attitude and said no, meanwhile i had someone do that for me before. then i ordered the chicken marsala and was very impressed by the first piece. as i was eating the other piece, i noticed it was hard, but i thought it was fine. i ate another piece of it and it was also hard. i called my mom to ask her if thats normal and she told me to ask the waitor, who was ignorning me the whole time. turns out the chicken was raw. the manager asked me why i ate almost the whole piece of chicken but i told him i wasnt sure but just kept eating. he only took the chicken off the bill meanwhile he shouldve comped the whole lunch for raw chicken! i am very upset that i ate raw chicken, a high class restaurant like this should do better. im never ever coming again. what a rude staff. super disapppointed. i hope this gets acknowledged.",0,0,0,Larry S.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",264,3,0

4.0,2/16/2019,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Starts at around 2 PM. This is not your normal brunch. It's almost as if you're eating and then all of a sudden it turns into a full blow club. The energy here is really loud and super enjoyable. I would definitely come here if you're trying to have a fun birthday celebration or to just to day drink with your pals. We had a bunch of mini plates to share which all tasted yummy. Fruit platter, mini pancakes, chicken salad ect. Everything was great! The waiter was fast and the bus boys are great too. This place you definitely want to dress somewhat nice. I wouldn't say it's casuals. I wore high heeled boots. For guys, I would say a dress shirt and jeans are cool. No sweat pants over here. The way they transition from a normal restaurant to a full on club is quite remarkable. The DJ was awesome and everyone there is just trying to party. You walk outside at 5 PM and you feel like the inside is 11 PM. Its awesome! I also recommend their club in the night time. Also very fun.",1,0,1,Ashley A.,"Huntington Station, NY",326,27,96

4.0,2/5/2019,"I came to Lavo for restaurant week. I've been to Lavo before, but only for lunch and was excited to try something different. Based on the pictures/reviews, the cocktails looked really interesting - I chose the Sangria Rosata (which looked really pretty but for $18 it was not the tastiest drink - it was very strong and not the most tasty FYI). For appetizers I chose the Tuna Tartare. It came with avocado and a balsamic dressing - both complimented the tuna perfectly. For my entree, I chose the Pappardelle Toscana. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was very flavorful. For dessert, I had the fried Oreos and Vanilla Malt. Overall, I loved the food portion of the meal, but the drink was definitely not worth it - given the price and taste.",0,0,0,Vivian C.,"New York, NY",210,93,16
4.0,2/2/2019,"Restaurant week review:First of all, I really enjoyed the complimentary garlic bread they provide to start. Really garlicky, and comes with a side of marinara sauce. I actually found it hard to stop eating this (and I'm not a big bread person).  I selected:-Tuna tartare: this was fairly good, although the sauce that they served it with was a bit too strong-Branzino: delicious. Cooked really well, and there was a fairly generous portion. Came  with a side of potatoes and kale(?), which complimented it well-Also ordered the Nutella pudding: $5 extra during lunch, which was delicious... strong chocolatey hazelnut taste Waiter was a bit standoffish though, possibly since it was Restaurant Week",4,3,5,Angelo B.,"Westfield, NJ",206,710,700

We wanted Italian and it's restaurant week so we decided to try out the restaurant. We had chicken marsala , grilled octopus , spaghetti with truffle mushroom stuff. My boyfriends dish definitely had a beautiful Italian name but I got wasted off of the cucumber gin drink on the menu . Overall restaurant week or not, you will spend money here .

4.0,1/5/2019,"Great place for business luncheons where you want to eat well and enjoy a glass of wine or two.Starting out...Yellow Fin Tuna Tartae crispy garlic and avocado in Black Olive Dressing soft and delicate on the palate.Lavo's infamous 16 oz hearty Meatball topped with fresh whipped Ricotta a wonderfully  lovely tease on the tongue for it's fresh and creamy texture that melts the palate along with the fresh Wagyu beef and Italian Sausage mixed meatball sized to share.A chunky, charred and tender tentacle of octopus so delicious and I recommend NO sharing it is so good you want it all to yourself, it isn't sized for two people who appreciate a nice tentacle of charred octopus. My main course was the NY Strip with a side of creamy spinach and Truffle fries, could not get photos of the entire course without offending my dining party but take my word for it in that it was an excellent meal and I took the remainder home for later.My business partner enjoyed a delicious serving of Chilean Sea Bass sized perfectly for lunch.We do love Lavo for dining, I would highly recommend reservations for lunch as the scene is  mobbed wall to wall during business hours.  What stopped the 5 stars was our unhappy server who had a bit of an attitude during my visit, was clearly not having a great day however it wasn't enough so as to disturb the enjoyment of our meal but noted for future visits I would request a different server should we get her again.",36,28,38,Tonya J.,"Essex County, NJ",43,431,5498

1.0,12/24/2018,"HORRIBLE SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT. My family and I are from Miami--  we usually fly out to Las Vegas 2x a year and ALWAYS dine at Lavo, which is always a pleasure. Food, service, and ambiance... impeccable. As for today, I am EXTREMELY disappointed. My family and I flew out today to NYC and decided to give the nyc location a go... worst decision ever. I have never felt so uncomfortable in my entire life. The only waitress among all the men took care of us, we were excited to start ordering our favorite appetizers which consist of : the cheese board, calamari, the delicious meatball with ricotta and the truffle fries. The waitress quickly cut us off with an attitude saying there was no way to put the appetizers in unless we ordered entrees. I mean, come on. My family and I like to take our time and enjoy our food on our vacation. She rushed away and completely ignored us for about 15-20 minutes; everyone around us was receiving the antipasto and the amazing garlic bread except for my table. Managers passing by, yet no attention. Finally after about 20 minutes, we received the antipasto- we kindly asked if we can get another order and all we got was a face. Okay, now the manager comes... he asks if everything was ""okay"" with so much sarcasm and an unwelcoming face. We asked again if we can get more bread after we were ignored by the busser. Now, as for the waitress? Not in sight. At all. I feel like she did her best to ignore us. This is the 35 minute mark, she finally shows up and takes our order with the most disgusting face. At this point my family and I had the urge to get up and walk out, but we still stuck around. She takes the order and walks away. Now... hear this. After we were forced to order our appetizers and entrees at once- she goes to the tables behind us asking if they were ready to order their entrees after they almost finished their appetizers. Are you kidding me? You make me and my family order at once, rush out our food, give us a face and not do it to others? If I'm not mistaken this is some form of discrimination. After the entrees come out I asked the waitress to bring out an extra plate so I can cut up my chicken parmigiana, and she gave me an eye roll and walked away. At this point my stomach turned and I was unable to enjoy my food. As if I were forcing myself to eat- my family and I did not enjoy anything due to the lack of friendliness. At the end, we asked for the check, nearly spending $400 for a party of five. As much as it hurts me, I did not leave a single penny. I left the waitress and the manager a note saying, ""horrible management and service, learn how to smile. Merry Christmas."" Overall, the service and management is beyond horrible. It does hurt because I am a regular at the Vegas location& have not had any problems there, but the NYC location truly left a bitter taste in our mouths. I am contemplating returning to LAVO in general. It truly hurts, but I will not have a woman who is bitter working on Christmas giving me attitude & a manager who does not have a face to be in public make me and my party feel uncomfortable. Not a pleasant way to have your Christmas Eve Dinner.",5,0,2,Sav S.,"Miami, FL",14,15,2

Now when I first arrived, the first thing I thought based on the crowd, that this nightclub is for the pretentious and snobby and that the people who frequent this spot are Europeans. Good thing we were getting in with a promoter because honestly I don't believe you can get in any other way. Walked in, it was little to no people in there only surrounding the bar and the DJ had an awesome playlist. Eventually people started to crowd the dance floor. Although the music was great and we had free drinks all night, I can't say I would go back. It's a cute club, but very small given how exclusive it seemed to be.

The salads were fresh and I loved the one with beets and feta cheese. The pastas were ok but nothing out of the ordinary.

When we received our entrees the steak was neither presented, nor prepared as it was so elegantly described by our server.

While the service was a little slow, we became mesmerized by our wait person Natasha.  Very pretty and her speech and mannerisms were impeccable.  Much more so than even the best wait people out there. I kept wondering if she was an actor in her other life. She looked like she could have played ""Belle "" in Beauty & the Beast!  And oh yeah... the food was actually pretty good. By the time we left around 11pm, the place was packed and from what we could see, Natasha was the only wait person running like crazy. I would go back just to have Natasha serve me.  Highly professional, efficient and very pretty.  My wife and daughter thought so also.

I loved the baked clams and the sauce that came with it. I ended up soaking it up with the garlic bread they provided us. The tuna tartar is really good too.

3.0,6/21/2018,"Went to Lavo last night for my brothers birthday because I heard it was a fun birthday spot. First I will start off with the ambiance. The restaurant is loud because it gives off the clubish vibes which I like so for people who like loud music in the background this is ur place. For the food:We ordered ""the meatball"" which we all thought was really really good. The flavors are amazing and it is cheese heaven. We also ordered the seafood grande tower or whatever it's called and NEVER again will I order that from this place again!!! The clams and oysters were not cleaned properly they were so gross and crunchy! Also, they did not cut the clams off the shell so they were hard to get off. So those two I was not impressed with at all but the rest of the seafood tower was good. But honestly, the oysters and clams are a main component of that dish so they should put more effort into making sure they are clean!! Next, we ordered family style so we ordered for entree the porterhouse medium rare and the rigatoni melanzane. Both of these dishes tasted very good. The porterhouse was cooked well and the pasta dish is one of my favorites and it was nice and cheesey. Only problem was, the entrees came out 15 minutes prior to them clearing all the appetizers (which were finished). By time we got the food it was all cold.... like what?!!! That really turned me off. At least bring the food back into the kitchen and put it on a heating rack until the waitress finally comes and clears the food!! Nope, I just watched it sit on the side for 15 minutes until the waitress finally scrambled over and cleared the table. Lastly, for dessert we ordered the fried Oreo zeppole which were to die for they were so good! I was expecting them to come out with the cardboard cupcake that said happy birthday but I guess that's only a weekend thing?? All in all, I was not totally impressed with the place.

It was ok, more on the heavy side where I think I would feel sick if I had finished the entire dish. For dessert, I got the layer chocolate cake to share. Warning-do not attempt to eat this alone. You will regret it for days. The cake was very rich and dense. There's peanut butter smeared between each cake layer.

Another negative, was drink service was not offered until everyone in the party arrived even though 13 of 15 were seated for 15min+. So definitely try and come on time for the sake of your group.

I had a sangria and it very tasty. We enjoyed their grilled garlic bread and a spring garden salad. We had to ask for additional dressing since it was severely underdressed. After the additional dressing, the salad was tasty. My husband ordered the full-sized pasta carbonara and it was al dente and pretty tasty. I ordered the half-sized pappardelle with veal bolognese and it was really good. At first glance, I thought there wasn't very much pasta, but after taking a bite, I found more pasta underneath. I love that they offer half-size portions since our hotel didn't have a refrigerator or microwave to enjoy the leftovers later. I really wish more restaurants offered smaller portions.

4.0,3/6/2018,"As I went to add my pics I noticed my review was gone? no worries glad to add a fresh review here.. it turns out the review ended up on the now Lavo Club page. First time visiting during restaurant week, Drinks I usually go with Pinot Grigio great wine, a Cosmo not bad or some Peroni Beer hard to go wrong with either choice.  Appetizers they start u off w that great Garlic bread & Marinara sauce plus a small thing of Anti-pasta good olives & veggies not too bad.We tried the Caesar Salad & Tuna Tartare never had the salad before this was actually very good nice taste to the dressing Tuna Tartare is great very fresh w the avocado & black olive dressing. Main dish I had the Ribeye steak w some Truffle fries wow great tasting piece of meat nice & juicy very flavorful, really good truffle fries.  My friend had the Chicken Marsala another tasty dish w the red wine sauce. Dessert never tried before I must say the Oreo Zeppoles wow delicious dipped in the ice cream even better.  Strawberry cheese cake was really good as well. Some of my favorites Kobe beef rice balls are amazing, good Calamari the giant meat ball is great so is the Margarita pizza all great to share. Main dishes Crispy chicken Dominic great taste so is the Spaghetti carbonara light cream sauce, good as well the Salmon Oreganato. Service has always been good, great deal during restaurant week, price wise expensive but worth the try, food here has never disappointed will continue to visit from time to time.",10,1,6,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",546,1069,6718
5.0,3/5/2018,This restaurant is a must to go to. The food is phenomenal the service is amazing and great drinks. Went for dinner the other night and everything was spot on. Great Italian food. The server was attentive and very personable. She laughed with us and was very on top of things. If you go have Jessica wait on you. She's a breathe of fresh air in a city where some servers make you feel like their doing you a favor. The GM Nick very upstanding guy. Any issues you can speak to him and it will be corrected.

4.0,2/21/2018,"Restaurant week is what brought us here. Their normal menu is pretty pricey. Our reservation was for 8:15. We all got there on time and found ourselves waiting for a good 40 minutes. Thank god this restaurant understands the concept of a two way street. If you're over 30 minutes late, a restaurant will give your reservation away. If the restaurant is over 30 minutes late in giving you a table, usually nothing happens. But the fine hostess offered us a complimentary round of drinks because of the wait which wins my heart over. I had a 3 course meal consisting of the following below: Avocado Tuna Tartare - I'm not crazy about Tuna but anything Avocado wins, right?! Plus, the waiter recommended it. Salmon - Oh do I love me some Salmon. I only have Salmon at fancy restaurants and I've never been disappointed. Dark chocolate Salted Nutella something something - I don't remember the name but no no no. Too salty. Too dark chocolately. I tried the fried Oreo dessert from my friend and yes, yes, yes get that don't ask any questions. This place turns into a night club after 11 and it's one of the top clubs in NYC so if you're going to dinner here, I recommend you stay for the party. It's not an easy place to get into for sure, especially for guys.",0,0,0,Sahil R.,"Manhattan, NY",644,77,60
4.0,2/19/2018,"I visited this location in october for my birthday. I figured I would try something new and do the saturday brunch party. We were a party of 8 adults. The place is very easy to get to and parking is close by. They dont have valet. The place itself isnt that nice on the inside but it doesnt even matter because it all fades away when the music is blasting and everyones having a blast.We got there a few minutes passed our reservation and lined us up outside. This was a turn off becaue i felt treated like an animal but we werent outside long. They still sat us shortly after. As soon as you enter the restaurant the music is bumping. This is exactly what i was looking for. A vegas style brunch party. They escorted us thru the crowd to our table. It was pack with wall to wall people and it was a little annoying to get to our table because we keep walking around people and excusing ourselves to pass. This isnt safe and a fire hazzard. Once we were seated and given menus the fun and celebration began. The ambience was a great vegas party vibe with a dj blasting good music. The music was so loud i couldnt hear my thoughts. (I loved this) It put eveyone in the party mood and started things off right. We quickly ordered rounds of shots and other drinks to start off. Our waiter was the best (no names mentioned). He knew exactly what to recommend and how to take care of us. He was very attentive and didnt abandon us like i expected because the place was packed out with people wilding out.  For brunch I ordered the LAVO burger cooked medium because it was highly recommended. It arrived with a very nice presentation. The the burger was cooked perfectly to temperature and was amazing. It wasnt an average burger and It beat any trendy burger place ive ever been to. It was accompanied by truffle fries that were also good. (I mean who doesnt love truffle fries)After we all ate we went back to parting and continued to dance and drink. The waiter kept the drinks coming and made sure we had enough water bottles on ice when vodka and champagne became to much to drink. The bathrooms for ladies are a nightmare. The lines are always long for the ladies so i recommend keeping an eye out when its short and force yourself to go when its short so you dont find yourself in a conundrum.Finally I had a nice birthday shoutout durring the party and they came around to the table with a beautiful dessert platter and huge sign with my name on it. This was escorted to the table by dancers with sparklers and the attention was on me. This was awesome. Only problem with this was they spelt my name wrong by missing one letter. (its ok it happens, just dont let it happen agian) The dessert platter had many different things on it and the dough bites were amazing!! Security was defenitly lacking here though because we caught several people stealing our drinks and food right off our table while we danced around. (yes you read that correctly) I have never seen something like that. We were paying a premium and freeloaders we never met were taking stuff off our table. I know its not LAVOs fault but its not fair to customers. Keep an eye on your belongings and food!!Finally the bill came when the brunch was over. We closed the place out. Security was then in a rush to get us out which was rude. We just spent 4 figures in 4 hours and this how you treat us at the end. Not ok. Theres a right way to handle everything and they didnt make us feel appreciated. Where was security when people were stealing our drinks and food. UNEXCEPTABLE. But then we paid the bill and left. I would recommend the brunch party anyday minus the few little things that went wrong. The music is bumping. The place is full of life and the vegas vibe makes everything great for a celebration or just a saturday afternoon out after a work week with friends. The foods great and drinks are tasty. The age group is 21-35yrs old. I would recommend bottle service when going with big groups and not do a le carte drinks. A reservation is a must.

3.0,2/19/2018,"I wanted to give Lavo 5 stars, but I had to take a star off for service and a star off for noise level. Like their Vegas counterpart, the food was spectacular. Meatball is a must have! I plan to return but really hope that next time they will turn the music down just a few decibels so we can hear each other speak (Large speakers pointing down at the tables line the entire side of the dining room) I've seen this complaint in other reviews so obviously I am not alone here. The staff here is, well, just plain cold and unfriendly (Bartender excluded;  He was warm and personable). As our meal neared its end, the bus staffer loomed over our plates like a seagull waiting to swoop in on our last remaining bites. I found myself grabbing the last bits of bread while the other plates were being whisked away. Speaking of cold, be forewarned that this place closes down after Saturday brunch and then reopens at 7PM, meaning if you arrive early for the first seating at 7:30 you will be left out in the cold (as about 10  of us early arrivals were. At around 7:10PM intimidating bouncers with earpieces finally allowed us to enter. The check in process is a mess. Since we were 15 minutes early for our reservation we grabbed some of the few seats at the bar and then realized people were pouring in through the doors and checking in ahead of us. I guess now that I know how it works, maybe it won't be so bad next time. Yes, I will go back, as the food is great and I am hopeful that reviews like this will help Lavo make the necessary tweaks for a five-star review next time.",0,0,0,Evan S.,"Brookline, MA",0,22,10

3.0,12/5/2017,"My wife and I came here since we were going to see the Radio City Christmas Spectacular with the Rockettes. LAVO offers a discount for those who are attending the show so I figured why not?  We love Italian food! The pictures make it seem like it's ""fine dining"" but it was more of s casual eatery with the fine dining feel. No dress code from what I gather by the way some of the patrons were dressed. Our waiter was awesome. Absolutely awesome. Personable, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. Drinks. Strawberry mojito for me and my wife had a glass of Riesling.  Garlic bread with marinara was served at the start of the meal. The marinara sauce was good. I expected better but it wasn't bad by any means. I had the spicy lobster bisque. Delicious. Hot. And it was generously portioned. We got the baked stuffed clams for an appetizer. Again, delicious. Six stuffed clams with some sort of garlic lemon sauce on the plate. For dinner, we opted to get ""half plates"" instead of full because we wanted dessert and we're going to snack at the show. My wife got the Rigatoni Melanzana. The sauce was good. The pasta wasn't too hard. And the portion was perfect. I also had pasta, and went with the Penne Ala Vodka. The sauce was okay. I've had better Vodka sauce numerous times before. The pasta though, a little too aldente for me. The dishes did come out fast so maybe my pasta needed a little more time. Dessert. I went with old faithful NY Style Cheesecake. The cheesecake portion was huge. I didn't finish it. It had a lemony flavor to it and was topped with Crème Brûlée. Different. I'd give the cheesecake a 7/10 for cheesecake but a 4/10 for ""NY Style"" cheesecake. My wife had the tiramisu. Iy was delicious, again generously portioned. All in all I went into LAVO thinking the food was going to be out of this world, but it wasn't. It was good.  If not for the awesome service, I wouldn't have been happy. Also, the men's room toilet was Out of Service. It happens, but that's something that should have been taken care of right away.

2.0,10/24/2017,"We were coming from out of town and after having a great experience during the holidays and recommending this place to several people, I was excited to go back. Called and reserved a table with knowledge that it was $100 min per person for the Riviera Sunday and got an email confirmation that I had a reservation that said '$100 food and beverage minimum per person, not including tax, or gratuity. This option will guarantee you a table in the back portion of the main dining room.'. Showed up and was met with a very rude 'Sorry, you didn't call to confirm the day before and we are oversold so we are going to sit you in the cafe'. Apparently this is their new policy that I was never told about (which I think was BS but they were trying to save face for mismanaging reservations). Anyways, we were starving so we sat. The waitress that was serving us obviously didn't want to be there. They so kindly told us after we had spent over $200 on food/wine, that they were able to sit us in the Riviera party, but that we would have to spend another $200 to sit in there. For what? when we left past 11:30, there was still only one person dancing around on stilts that wasn't able to even dance because everyone was wanting to take pictures with her. What a complete ripoff. I will no longer be recommending this place. I would recommend to the owner that he find a new manager because the girl handling things wasn't doing a very good job. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because their gnocchi was amazing...Staff was super rude!",0,0,0,Gwen R.,"Broomfield, CO",24,22,1

All of us order food and drinks. Nothing over the top just a simple dinner because we planned on going out after dinner. Now he's the disappointing part. When we asked for our bill one of my friends paid. Our bill was less than $600 for 8 people so on average we all spent about $75. Not bad for 8 people at all. My friend provided a card and they brought it back and said it declined then asked for another form of payment. He was unsure of why it wasn't working but figured because we were traveling that's why it didn't work. So he provided them with another card and it did not work either. At this point things aren't making sense. So another one of my friends offers his card. Same thing happens, and he actually gives two cards as well. We gave them a total of 5 cards and not one worked at this point I knew they were targeting us. My friends manager then states there's no way none of the cards are working there's clearly something wrong with your system. The server comes back with the manager at this point and he's saying the same thing. Now, when we state who one of my friends is (NBA player) they try his card again (after googling him if you ask me) and then come back and say it worked. Not sure how the same card didn't work initially but now all of a sudden did.

4.0,10/22/2017,I went to this place for my friends birthday brunch on a Saturday. The outside is nice with a very large overhang and security outside with barriers. Their is no parking in front but across the street you could park in the metered parking. Once you get inside the front has no lights or dj. It's just tables and a bar. The front has its own menu separate from the rear room. The rear room has security and you need a stamp to get in. Those tables are a 2k minimum with lights and a dj. In the rear room it's all bottle service menus and its own bar. The rear also has the bathrooms. Guys no problem in and out. Ladies on the other hand the line is extremely long! The front had more room but the rear is very packed because it's where the party is going on. The food was amazing which is probably because it's an authentic resturante too. The drinks were well made also and the weight staff is quick. The security and bus people are very polite even the bathroom attendant.

I actually ate before I went to ""brunch""... knowing that it's mostly about the drinks. To start we were given a few bottles of champagne with our food, and then the bottles of vodka kept flowing.

1.0,9/17/2017,"Where do I start...I don't ever write reviews, but last nights outing deserved a review. By all means, the food was great, but HOWEVER, the service was terrible. Reservations? For what? To still wait an hour or so to get seated and situated. We had to keep checking in with the hostess to see if our table was finally available and the response was always ""they're cleaning up the table. As soon as one becomes available we'll seat you."" How can you be cleaning ""our"" table and then say once ""a table"" becomes available, we will seat your party. Right before we were told that our table was ready, we asked them again if it's ready and she says ""there's a table. Do you want it or no?"" Like what do you think we want? We've been here waiting for our table. So we finally get seated, finish our food and now it's time to bring out the cake. Asked the waiter not to give us huge pieces of our cake that WE BROUGHT because it was a pretty big cake, so he gave us perfect sized pieces. Now it's time to go and he brings the remainder of the cake for us to take home. We didn't receive the rest of the cake back in our box but in a Tupperware that was placed in bag. That worries me but I figured they sliced the rest of the cake up and gave me the remainder. Now comes to today when we're ready to eat more cake, we see that we're left with a SLICE of cake! A SLICE! Based off of the pieces that were served to us, more than half of the cake remained, if not a little more. Sooo the waiters obviously took a good part of the cake for themselves. We would've offered, and that's what's usually done, but it looks as if they took it upon themselves to just take whatever they wanted which was not right at all! I paid for this cake and by all means, the rest is supposed to come back to me!

When ordering the fish meal which costs $41 the customer expectations are that it will be at least without bones Dj playing loud music during the dinner makes it impossible to talk at the table without shouting.

1.0,9/11/2017,"LAVO the terrible.........On Sunday September 10,2017, my wife and I left TAO restaurant after a well cooked dinner. As we both exit the restaurant we both observed what appeared to be a nice swanky lounge across the street with well dressed patrons and cool music blaring. Naturally both my wife and I were interested in joining in the festivities. Unaware of their alleged ""exclusive"" entrance policy, the staff suggest a price of $150 a piece to gain entry. While we waited patiently on line, numerous of causal dressed people were allowed entry by said security personnel upon arriving at the door.  As these individuals passed my wife and I repeatedly without a wait or without paying anything, it appeared as if something strange was occurring. The security personnel asked if we were on a guess list, I replied no, his response was to ""stand by"". After continuing to wait yet longer I observed a security personnel  ask another personnel  something in his ear in regards to my wife and I.   The money is not the issue, here as I reside walking distance from the establishment. However, we found it ridiculous to even suggest  $150 per person as a cover charge. Maybe  it could have been the melanin in our skin that commanded this cover charge because no other individual before us who gained entry into Lavo paid any fee. We both earn well over six figures a year, so the money is not the issue, but it appears that this cover charge was given as a deterrent for two people of color on this particular night. Lastly, who pays $150 on a Sunday night to get into anywhere? Sunday is not a popular night for most lounges, bars or clubs. I live in midtown Manhattan, I can literally walk to to Lavo from my apartment. In five years I have yet to hear of a $150 cover charge on a Sunday night, Lavo staff who do you think you are you fooling? In other words avoid this revenue like the plague.

Even when we tried to tell a group of 4 other employees what had happened - they told us they didn't want to hear it.

He was about to let all the ladies in when he found out they had two gay men coming in with them - all of the sudden the cost of admission was $1,500 minimum bottle service.

I honestly didn't even want to patronize this club after the homophobic & misogynistic comments we had to endure, but this is really where the bachelorette wanted to go, so we sucked it up. Once inside, the area for ""bottle service"" was just a small booth seat open to the main dance floor. The dance floor was soo crowded, people kept knocking into our drink table and standing in our area. Another group behind us was smoking weed and was soo wasted they spilled multiple drinks on us. We complained to a floor manager/security but nothing was done. The crowd was mainly 20 something d-bags and trashy girls/escorts who were soo drunk they could hardly stand up.

Tonight, I decided to give them another chance before going to catch a show at their club. I ordered the spaghetti. It was undercooked (even for al-dente), and the sauce tasted average (especially for a place that purports to be trendy). The only way I knew it wasn't straight out of the supermarket bottle were the crushed tomato, fresh but nearly flavorless basil and pieces of garlic. The service was excellent, though, and that's why this place got 3 stars instead of 2.

We walk in around 2:30 and the music didn't start yet, but right around 3 the music was turnt up, the drink came to the table, and the party officially started!

Everything was pretty good, it was all hot when it came, but the portions aren't large, I wouldn't go here to eat, it's more of party. Once our table was done eating they took off the table cloth and left the table bare, I was shocked by this because the table was dirty and ugly. Lavo is a very nice restaurant and this seemed weird to me, I let it rock since I was just trying to get my drink on, but I thought it looked grimy, all the tables were filthy looking! I understood a little later why they did it a dancer came out and performed on top of our table and dancing with a tablecloth on is dangerous, I suppose. We danced until 5:30ish, it was a lot of fun! If you're bougie and love getting decked out, this is the place for you, everyone was dressed up from their head to their toes! The music was primarily edmish and today's hip-hop/pop.

I decided to order lunch from Lavo and went with the pre-fixe lunch option since I had a $40 cap (work rules...). I figured it was time to order from a 4-star option. I went with the Chicken Marsala, the Organic Mixed Green salad, and the Season fruit plate. The bill came to $38.50.What I got should have cost $15-20. The salad was decent. I really liked the house dressing and the blend of greens, and the fruit was fresh and firm, no sogginess or bruising. As for the chicken marsala, you know, the main event, it was incredibly bland and the sauce very soupy. The entire dish had absolutely no flavor. I was kind of expecting it to be served with a small side of pasta, but it wasn't. Instead it came on a bed of cooked spinach, which I happen to hate. Not their fault, per say, but perhaps if it doesn't come with pasta, it should be mentioned. Halfway through I noticed some large odd piece of gristle looking something in the dish (see photo). I understand things happen, but this entire piece of whatever wasn't even remotely edible by looking at it. The garlic bread, sad to say, was the redeeming factor. Slightly crisp, perfectly seasoned, and the sauce was just right. I've heard people constantly rave about Lavo and I'm sad to say that my first experience was incredibly disappointing.

It was not very busy when we arrived but when we were leaving people started flowing in for the after work bite (around 530PM). For appetizers we got the tuna tartare, mussels marinara and baked clams oreganato. The tuna tartare was delicious! The top layer was tuna and the bottom was avocado and with every bite you could tell how fresh the ingredients were. The was a hint of lime that was not overpowering. Mussels marinara was also a very good selection. There was a piece of bread in the middle soaking into the sauce, which had a little spicy kick to it.For entrees, we got the chicken marsala, which was mediocre at best. The chicken was under seasoned and the over baked. The mushrooms also had an off taste. The salmon oreganato was also okay and nothing special. The bed of zucchini pasta was the most delicious part of both entrees.Desserts were amazing! The nutella bundino had a sprinkle of sea salt on top when mixed with the richness of the nutella chocolate was absolutely amazing. We also had the oreo zeppole, which was served with a malt vanilla shake that was perfect for dipping to off balance the sweetness of the oreo zeppole.Overall, I had a good dining experience and great service.

The coat was seriously RIGHT THERE, but she told me I'd have to come back the next day. Infuriating. I was so frustrated I asked for the manager.

Garlic bread was amazing.Our plates and utensils were cleared before we were finished eating- and unfinished appetizers were left on the table without silverware to eat with.Our meals did not come out soon after, so not too sure why they were in a rush to collect our appetizer dishes.Main courses came- amazing.Asked if we were finished at least 2 times although our table was still clearly working on our food.When we were done, 3 people came to collect the dishes, but rushed away before one of our attendees could ask for her dish to be wrapped.Although the server was polite enough to ask if she wanted her dish re-made to take home, the fact that her plate and serving was dumped without being able to ask for it wrapped was quite annoying- especially at $30+ a plate!When the check came, the server took our bill before we had added our cards, and did not get everyone's card. We did not even know he took it- In such a rush! There were so many open tables and NO wait.When we told him we had other cards to add, he should have just said I'll take care of it. Instead, he slightly blamed one of us saying someone told him to take it. He eventually re-charged and attempted to reverse the charges. Cards still not processed a few days later.Overall pretty poor experience, which is unfortunate because the food was great. If it was one instance, I could understand- Everyone makes mistakes. I don't think I will be dining at LAVO again.",0,0,0,Kelsey D.,"Eatontown, NJ",227,12,3

1.0,12/17/2016,"I've been to lavo twice. First time was great. Second time, could have been better. On second trip, food was so so. My chicken Dominick tasted like it had been microwaved. also, no oven or stove could have gotten it as hot as it was when served to me. Also, when served to me, the chicken breast was already cut in three places - clearly it was cooked prior to my ordering, maybe even the day before, and re-heated and re-assembled for serving to me. The bigger problem is we went there, 2 couples and a 6 year old. We got seated right by the bathroom and asked to move to one of the several other open tables. Granted it was a Saturday night, but it was only 730pm- far from peak. The manager was incredibly rude and suggested we take a booth meant for 4 people. When I reminded him we had 5 people, including two large men (each 6'2"" 200lbs), he did not seem to care. Told him that we wouldn't all fit in his booth, and we were insulted that he thought a booth for 4 was a good option, when there was clearly an open table near us and also separated from the bathroom. He was entirely rude and not helpful, and when we challenged him on seating us somewhere we would enjoy, he continued to be rude and dismissive in an unprofessional manner. I don't know where this guy came from, but he clearly doesn't have the people skills to be a manager. As I indicated to him then, my wife and I have been lucky enough to eat at some of the nicest restaurants in the world, and we have never been treated as rudely as the manager at Lavo treated us.

We didn't object or challenge her although we were thinking we'd only be there for about an hour. The server was not at all enthusiastic about serving us; she didn't even introduce herself. She took our order, brought our food, and that was that. I gave 2 stars because the food was actually pretty decent. I had the lobster dish which was fresh, my husband had the steak which was cooked to perfection. I kid you not, less than an hour later the hostess began seating people in the same main dining room she said she couldn't seat us in. Seemed awfully discriminatory.

Because of the big crowds, however, I somehow wound up back in front of the other table (a table, mind you, that had NO ONE sitting at it.) The bounced walks straight up to me and says, ""You don't f***ing listen, do you?"" Incredibly unnecessary and rude. I then moved 12 inches over which he deemed to be satisfactory. He also swore at my friend several times threatening to kick her out. Now, my friends and I are very self aware people; I KNOW when I'm doing something wrong, especially since I was not drinking a ton.

4.0,10/31/2016,"I'd like you to take a moment to think back. Think back to a classic show that matched wit and strength, where the boys were separated from the men, and where death was stared at boldly in the eye and conquered with every breath by the bravest of warriors! I'm sure we're on the same page when I say that Nickelodeon GUTS was amazing!For years I watched this show and wished that I could one day climb the Super Agro Crag and be the first to slam the button as the crowd cheered my name. Denzyl..........the hell does this have to do with Lavo beloved!? I swear to you that Lavo is literally the adult Agro Crag of brunch!The pure exhilaration and intensity that the Agro Crag brings is the exact same feeling that I felt as I stood atop the Lavo furniture and gazed down on the spectacle that was unfolding before me. When you first walk into the restaurant, you will not immediately see the glory, but enjoy the warm-up while it lasts. There's nothing special about the decor while the lights are on. The staff however was great. They truly have the brunch spirit within them and will share their essence with you as you prepare for the turn up.The food is.......I mean lets be honest you're not coming here for the food, but since you will be partaking in some, I suggest that you go with the Lavo burger. It' the perfect precursor to prepare your body for the turn up it's about to experience. The garlic aioli is perfect and is paired well with the truffle fries on the side. In addition, it might be best to stay away from the chicken & waffles dish. Believe me, I know how hard it is to deny such a favorite brunch meal, but Lavo is just not the place that'll be known for their, what honestly looked like, chicken tenders and eggos.Whatever you get to eat I'm sure it'll just be a pit stop on your road to turn  up greatness. Lavo brunches are designed for absolutely no home training. Never have I been to a place, where the security literally tells you to go and stand on the table (in fact I get the exact opposite direction 90% of the time from security). The many ways that the waiters bring out the bottles will have you in awe as well. With custom made signs, cheerleaders on shoulders, whistles blasting, and much more, sparklers will be the least thing you look forward to when your bottles are brought out. The DJ plays a dope mix between Hip Hop, R&B, Reggae, and House music and I am sure you will thoroughly enjoy every beat.We lost our chance to climb the Agro Crag in our youth, but make sure you don't miss the chance to climb a table at Lavo for brunch.",4,4,4,Denzyl A.,"Plainfield, NJ",509,119,131

The stars are for the decor, which had a French vibe despite being an Italian restaurant and the fried calamari, which was crispy and well-seasoned.

For the main course, I had the brick-oven salmon oreganato and my dining partner had the Chicken Marsala.   The salmon was definitely the better of the two.  The fish was cooked and seasoned well and the sauce was tangy and delicious.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken, to say the least. My dining mate, however, liked it well enough.  It should be noted that the waiter warned us that we'd be getting Demi-portions due to us ordering from the restaurant week menu. Good thing for us because we were stuffed. I cannot imagine what the full-sized portions would be like. For dessert, I went with the I had the Nutella Budino (pudding).

We were immediately seated since the restaurant for the most part was pretty quiet.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and two orders of the Porterhouse steaks (about $110 each) to share between the two couples. The food was great and we really enjoyed our dinner,  HOWEVER we were definitely discriminated against and did not realize it until the end. When we were ready to leave a few hours later I told my husband to ask for the check. He asked the waitress and she brings back the receipt for him to sign. When I asked how she got his Amex in the first place, he says that she asked for payment with id right after we had ordered???????? Initially he did not think anything of it thinking she was just holding a tab, although we had been seated at a table??????? I didn't notice what was going on and neither did the couple we were with because we were so busy talking about life and having a good time.  It turns out that once we ordered an expensive meal she felt the need to collect payment up front. We've been to the best of the best restaurants. In 2016 how dare they assume that we could not afford to be ordering expensive meals. Only if they knew who was seated at our table not that that should even matter. As much as I love Lavo, never would I return based on this treatment. There was only one word to describe this experience and I'm disappointed that this happened to me. Never have I felt so disgusted.

This is not a place I would usually go due to the price range, but it was not my night to decide so I went in with high expectations expecting the most. The good: the jumbo meatball .. Delicious I wish I could've just had that all night long. Seafood pasta with lobster- my boyfriend loved it! Defined my worth it!The dessert- this big combination platter with all their desserts was sent out and it was delicious!The bad- service. I work in a high end steakhouse so I know the deal In a place like this and I know how things should be handled. I ordered a bone in ribeye - medium. Mind you dinner came out and was served. The table all got their food, except me. I'm patient, I wait .. We're now halfway through the meal and I have no food. I flag down 3 separate employees, no waiter to be found. When waiter finally comes over he goes ""sorry they burnt your first steak, the food will be out shortly."" Ok, no problem. Now the bus boys are CLEANING THE TABLE. My party is done eatting. I still have yet to get my food still no server in sight and I know the manager is aware and he kept eyeing our table and avoiding us. Now it gets worse .. They set the table for dessert. I literally have not even seen my food. Now I'm upset, going to a dinner you knew was out of budget and then having such a bad experience. I finally get my dinner without my side (desserts on the table) and I had to take one bite and take my $70 steak to go and eat it the next day from the microwave because my table was ready for dessert. Disappointment when they finally brought the side I ended up giving it to a homeless person on the street after. They took care of the steak at the end but I feel as thought this could be taken care of earlier and was avoided by management to begin with. Not professional at all and a damper on my meal and expierence if possible would give 2.5 stars but went down since not an option.

It was a Friday night so the place was a buzz with the later dinner goers. We were seated right after a large party that had a dozen people in it. Our waiter had to take care of both of us, and a few other tables and did a good job of making sure that we had everything we needed and checked to see how things were frequently. We loved everything we ordered! The food was top notch. We started with the meatball... and we should have paced ourselves. It can serve four easily as an appetizer, but it was so good we split it in half. No regrets, but having ordered an entree after that and dessert haha- we were worried we would have to be rolled home. I ordered the Salmon {the seasoning was so delicious}  and only got through half of it, my husband the same with his New York Strip and the side of truffle fries. It normally would have ended there but being a birthday celebration we went for the fried oreos and good Lord, still thinking about them today #amazing.

4.0,2/3/2016,"Nice small venue, but expensive as hell if you're planning to have drinks all night at the bar. I had a Long Island iced tea for 22 bucks (tip not included).  Coat check was 8 bucks.  Granted, the venue is upscale, and so it comes song with the territory.  Along with upscale comes a degree of ""professional,"" and possibly mature, so there's a good chance you don't have to worry about a bottle being cracked over your head because you ""looked"" at a guy's girlfriend the wrong way.  I came here to see Steve Aoki perform, and despite the upscale and possibly ""boring"" crowd, everyone had a good time.  I can't recall any alarming moments, but maybe it's because the music took everyone to a nice place likely elevated by molly, coke, and an imaginary drug I just created in my mind called POP (Pants Off Party) I wasn't sure what to expect considering the small space (which is a restaurant during the day) for an EDM event, but little did I know that Lavo would produce a pretty awesome light show as the night progressed.  These multi colored flashing and laser beamed lights were accompanied by confetti falling from above, and a dancer erotically moved to the music in a mesmerizing yet tasteful way that didn't take away from the music and allowed the guys to keep the goods in their paints.  It eventually got a little crazy with cake being thrown at the birthday guests by the performer by request, so it seemed. The bartender seemed a little distracted and not too interested in creating a fun atmosphere among customers, but that could very well be a result of wealthy douchebags flashing bills and using cheap lines to get her to visit their lofts.  However, I did initiate some conversation and laughs with the bouncers and even the underpaid bathroom assistant selling gum and offering napkin service because.. How else would we wash our hands?  Their genuine answer to a typical night at Lavo was that it was all fun without a lot of common lounge or club intangibles, and I whole heartedly agreed at the end of the night.  I would check it out again, minus the drinks and coat check.",3,1,1,Robert C.,"Yonkers, NY",254,33,25

Maybe they were just confused after dropping us off at coat check so the start was a bit iffy.Staff: Once We sat down the staff was definitely on point and polite. They were always around filling our water or take any more requests so very reliable indeed. Food: The most important and greatest part about this placeTuna Tartar: Very small but the way its made is so damn fresh and soft. But it also has a nice kick in the sauce so your mouth is getting a medley of flavors. Presentation though for this is on point so get your phones ready.Strip Steak w/ Truffled Fries: Always get your steak med rare please. Anything else would just make it dry and hard to chew. This steak was SO GOOD - You can get steak sauce but it takes some time to warm up and its very liquidy and not thick. The fries were so freakin crispy and had a perfect amount of garlic to it. Share your meal so others can take joy in this dish.Oreo Zeppole: You have to get this because it is so good for you chocolate lovers. The presentation is great but taking that first bite is good soft and good with a lil ice cream on top...My mind is blown.

I had two friends of mine who had gatherings here and were not pleased with the food, the cost, and overall experience here. When I first arrived the security guard seemed to be a bit of a d**k as I just asked where should I go, with an attitude he said who are you with, then proceeded to point to the door I should go.

Subsequently after striking up a conversation with one of the employees, I found out Brett Favre was upstairs having a party, but by that point I had indulged in the free open bar and didn't care enough.Anywho, back to the festivities. Lavo has a large bar once you get past coat check and various couches and tables and then more seating toward the back. The set-up probably is different when it's not a party going on because along the right side was the food. They had salad, steaks, pasta, rice, mashed potatoes, and a few other items.The establishment was very spacious, the DJ was friendly and took various requests.

I always have an amazing time whenever we go (which is almost every weekend), given that the tables are set much farther back away from the main dance floor (which when I have had to walk through the dance floor it has always been very crowded and hot). For me this is quite appealing, given at other clubs (like Tao and 1OAK) the main dance floor and and tables are not as separated and everyone is on top of one another. Lavo ensures that this section with bottle service is air conditioned even in the winter, and all bottle service staff are extremely nice and accommodating - my friend had requested champagne instead of vodka and they immediately accommodated her request, saying she could have anything she wanted. As an FYI Lavo does primarily play house music (although this may be a bit different on different nights, since my promoter is only at Lavo on Saturdays I can only speak for this night). Still staff is friendly and ensure that if you have a table, your night is enjoyable.

My chicken was extremely dry and the breading looked like it was from the Shake n' Bake box. (I'm not exaggerating). The waffle was decent and the breakfast pizza with goat cheese and salmon was yummy and the omelet was just ok.

3.0,9/25/2015,"I went to Lavo Sunday night for a friend's birthday party. I wish I could leave two different reviews; 1 for the party and 1 for the restaurant/food, because I have entirely different feelings towards them both. 3 stars fairly sums up my experience consider both opinions. The party on Sunday was a blast; from the performers and dancers, to the live saxophone player- they threw quite a party. It was a lot of fun and the music was great. The entire restaurant was dancing and having a great time. If you are looking to throw an epic party for friends to remember, then I would certainly keep this place in mind.As for the restaurant- if you are looking to go out for a nice meal, I would suggest going elsewhere. The food was not impressive whatsoever. We started with the following appetizers;  baked clams oreganato, crispy fried calamari, seafood plateau grande, meatball with fresh whipped ricotta, and the margherita pizza. Overall the seafood did not taste fresh. I am not sure if it was because it was a Sunday night, but after a few pieces of the raw seafood I decided to steer clear. The pizza was good, but nothing outstanding. I do not eat beef so I did not try the meatball, but the fact that half of it remained on the table makes me think no one was impressed. For entrees we had the penne alla vodka, new york strip, and truffled french fries. the pasta had way too much sauce and was completely smothered. Considering the price of the food, you would think they would take more interest in making it better- but it is apparent that the party is the priority.

2.0,9/4/2015,"I came here on a Monday, very late night. Therefore I am not certain on how the normal ambiance is here. My review is simply in regards to the food and service.Reservations were made for my bother's 30th birthday in the restaurant area only.  Upon arrival, we were immediately seated and also advised that we had about 20 minutes to order, as the kitchen would close for the night by 11:30.  Definitely understandable, as I previously stated that I arrived very late approximately (11:15 p.m.). We were a party of 11, so the waitress took our orders as quickly as possible. Throughout the night she did her job efficiently, I have no complaints at all with her service.However the menu selection wasn't anything to write home about. For this to be labeled as an Italian restaurant, it was majorly subpar. Where do I even begin? There weren't many intriguing selections listed on the menu. I first opted for either the shrimp scampi, or chicken parmesan. However after finding out that neither a salad OR pasta would be served alongside, things went downhill from there. I cut my losses, and quickly opted for an appetizer.  How in the H-E- double L are you an ""Italian"" restaurant, and not serve salad or pasta with a main course?  Who advised that this would be a great idea?  Anyway, I chose the $32 dollar scallop appetizer, which was saltier than movie popcorn. I ate three, and threw the last one to the birthday boy. I had the waitress serve the cake that I brought in, and flew out of there so fast....This place was a complete waste of time and money.

It is!! I highly recommend you ask and take advantage of it. On their drinks, they have a large selection of wines and cocktail.During the weekend, I was informed that they provide live performances. During the night that we dined in, they had a live DJ. One impressive note that I'd like to share was their service. They were super busy, staff walking everywhere, and yet, they were all very attentive and on point especially when our glass was half empty, or when it was time for our plates to be removed for a new one.If you're looking to enjoy fine dining, hip ambiance, energetic music and excellent service with fantastic prix fixe menu, I highly recommend paying a visit to Lavo!!

3.0,7/31/2015,"Restaurant Week review ($38 for 3 course dinner): Back from a fun night out with friends and the company was so good that the meal paled in comparison... if you're looking for a bustling option in mid town to savor Italian, Lavo is a good bet, but don't expect to be blown away by the cuisine - nothing is truly exceptional and falls in the good to average category.Here's what I got - Beet salad, Eggplant parm and the Sorbet with fresh fruits.  The app and the desert were both excellent - The beet salad was a good portion, sprinkled liberally with goat cheese + almonds, it was crisp and fresh - perfect for a hot summer evening. The sorbet was smooth and melt in your mouth delicious - the real STAR of this meal - #getit. I'm not a die hard fan of eggplant parm, but since it was the only vegetarian option on the menu, I went for it. Honestly, this was one of the better versions of the dish I've had - the tomato sauce was rich, but wasn't made with canned tomatoes - which I hate.  Remember to ask for some garlic bread on the side to mop up the sauce with. Other dishes on the table:Veg minestrone soup - too watery and lackluster; tasted a bit of it and wouldn't recommend Tuna Tartare - a layer of tuna tartare on a bed of guacamole - the husband enjoyed it and said it was really well done. Chicken Marsala - strictly average. Salmon Livornese - flaky and buttery - by and large it was good, but had a slight odor Chocolate Budino - Yummy! Tiny portion though! Sprinkling of sea salt with the chocolate made it special. Service: I can't saw these guys hit it out of the park with their friendly service. At times it felt too rushed and the person who was bringing out the food couldn't be bothered to check who had ordered what. He kept the dishes randomly in front of anyone and expected us to sort it out among ourselves! The Yelp reviews also mention that they bring out garlic bread at every table before the meal. We didn't get any. When we asked them to bring out some with our main course, the server remarked - ""it's just regular garlic bread....you want me to bring out some more...?"" -- keeping up with the restaurant week crowd is tough for them, I guess...not that they are making much of an effort.",7,3,4,Arshi K.,"Hoboken, NJ",741,350,704

We had a reservation for five people but only four could attend . They seated us at a table  that was right next to the bathroom ( who wants to sit there ?)

I find the Tao Group overall to be slightly more focused on catering to its celebrity clientele and creating that ambience instead of focusing on the food, but that being said, the service was quite good. Onto the menu!- Margherita Pizza - actually quite good. Nice thin crust on the pizza!- Roasted Beet Salad - if you're into beets, this is a great salad- Rigatoni Melenzana - although the pasta was cooked nicely, I felt the sauce was nothing special. Typical flavors that I would find at a much cheaper Italian place.- Chicken Parmagiano - actually, this was probably one of the better Chicken Parmagiano's that I have ever had. I will hand it off to them!- Chicken Marsala - apparently one of the star items on the menu; I did not think there was anything special to it. Kind of bland and oversauced. - Grilled Tuna - eh. Better to get this kind of at a Japenese restaurant - it's a pass here.- Garlic Mashed Potatoes - amen here! Even if they're most likely overstuffed with butter and fatness, it works to its advantage here. I love mashed potatoes, and this is a great side dish.

(All of these comments were prior to getting sick)The service was great, our waiter was friendly and accommodating. Food was full of flavor and well cooked. The garlic bread and marinara was so good, I could have eaten it by myself. My boyfriend and I both had the lobster bisque, which was smooth and creamy. Since it is a gluten-free option, they don't use flour as a thickening agent so you know what you're getting is good. They also serve it table side so extra points.I had the Meatball with Whipped Ricotta for an entree with a side of Brussel Sprouts and my boyfriend had the Filet with a side of Mashed Taters. My meatball was so juicy, and again, the sauce was very very good. The filet was also an outstanding piece of meat. Our drinks were also stiff and delicious, so added plus there as well.

1.0,4/16/2015,"Can only comment on the nightlife here (came for a concert) but I was very disappointed. The bartenders were rude and the clientele was TERRIBLE. Literally everyone in this venue seemed provocatively dressed and unhappy. I have not encountered a more miserable group of drunk people in my life! I came to see a Lost Kings concert, a DJ duo I consider to be very talented, and they were blasting an airhorn at random times during the show! I have listened to their other shows and the Lost Kings did not do this, which makes me think it is something added by the venue. Why would the artist blast an airhorn during his own musical performance? The bouncer near the front of the stage was also incredibly rude to my friend, and screamed at her for ""trying to get in to the VIP area"" which was not the case because she was just dancing in the general audience space. Everyone here is clearly way too concerned with appearance, and ""VIP status"" and I would strongly advise everyone to stay away.

4.0,4/14/2015,Lavo is a good restaurant. The service was great and the ambiance was nice and intimate. To start I had the delicious Charred Octopus which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was served with salad along with seasoned potatoes. For my entrée  I had the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass. This dish was so yummy I wanted to order another lol.

4.0,4/11/2015,"I went to Lavo last night with my wife and 2 other couples to celebrate and engagement. I made the reservation using open table and had to leave a credit card as all parties of 6 or more are required to do. I was called by a hostess the day before to confirm. We all arrived at the time of our reservation and were promptly seated. Place was crowded by the bar and seemed to be a wait for tables for non reservations. Our wait person was Mia who took are drink orders. My wife and I had dirty martinis which were excellent. No one ordered any of their specialty drinks but seemed to enjoy their drinks. She then took our appetizer orders.. we ordered a few to share and she didn't rush us to take our dinner orders which we liked. We ordered the charred octopus which was excellent, the calamari which was very good, the clams and mussels which were bad but I have definitely had better and the meatball with ricotta. The meatball was excellent as well and it is large enough to split between 2 people or even 6 as we did and all get a little piece. Just fyi the meatball isnt covered in ricotta just a few well placed dallops. Mia returned our menus to us so we could order our main course. Again never rushed and was very attentive to out table w/o being over bearing. She appeared at the perfect times to get us new drinks. The entire waitstaff was very attentive.. clearing the table and making sure we had everything we needed. The main courses's ordered were a porter house for 2 medium rare excellent and the lobster fra diavolo which was awesome and a huge plate of food. 3 other pasta dishes were ordered but I'm not sure what they were but they were most definitely enjoyed. We also ordered 2 bottles of champagne that were brought out in dramatic fashion. My friend proposed at the table and the entire staff gets in on the act. Lights flash sparklers sparkle and music blasts. We ordered 2 strawberry shortckakes and a tiramiso. I only tried a little of the strawberry shortcake and it was delicious. Overall a great place.. will definitely return. Drinks were  great, food very very good, yes it's expensive but it's Midtown Manhattan and a trendy place. Felt we got were we paid for and then some. Also once again want to compliment the entire staff.. yes its a busy, loud and fast paced establishment but they made it look easy. Good job!!!",1,0,0,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",67,92,159

4.0,3/27/2015,"I think I may have eaten a week's worth of food in one evening... Got here around 6:30pm with a party of 6. We were promptly seated at a nice round table in the middle corner of the restaurant. We started out with two bottles of wine (red and white). They brought out garlic bread with marinara sauce which was one of the best I've had. The bread was moist and perfectly flavored with garlic and butter while the marinara sauce added a nice touch. We ordered 4 appetizers - the eggplant parmesan, charred octopus, meatball, and fried calamari. Every single one of these dishes were delicious! The eggplant parmesan was massive and we couldn't finish all of it. The charred octopus dish came with two pieces of the octopus leg and a salad garnish. The octopus was perfectly charred and meaty and salad garnish was light and refreshing. The fried calamari came with the same marinara sauce as the garlic bread. It was lightly fried, super crispy. The meatball was good but not as amazing as the rest of the dishes. It was a gigantic meatball which may make it harder for it to be moist and delicate. The meatball was a bit dry and rough. I probably wouldn't have gotten this considering all of the other amazing options available.For main dish, I ordered the lobster fra divalo which again, was massive in serving size. The seafood included was carefully counted - 3 scallops, 3 pieces of lobster, 5 shrimp, 4 clams and 4 mussels - it wasn't loaded with seafood. However, there was A LOT of pasta. The scallops were moist but the lobster meat was rather tough to slice and chew. The pasta itself was a bit dry and not too flavorful. I had to fish around the bottom of the dish to get some of the remaining sauce with the pasta. For the price ($45) was expecting something more tender and flavorful. There are definitely far better places to get this for the price.For dessert, our table ordered 4 different ones - tiramisu, strawberry shortcake, bread pudding, and oreo zeppole. The oreo zeppole was the best by far! It was delicate, flavorful, and a total crowd pleaser. The shortbread used in the strawberry shortcake was really dry and hard. Since it made up more than 50% of the dish, made the entire dish a bit unpleasant. The bread pudding was good but also a bit dry. The ice cream that came with the bread pudding was better than the bread pudding itself. The tiramisu came in a ice cream sundae dish and was a bit difficult to share. Was standard, not exceptional like the zeppole.Overall, our party had a great time with good food and great service. Our water glasses were mostly empty but otherwise, the server was attentive.",0,0,0,Grace B.,"New York, NY",137,71,129

When the food arrived, the tunner had to wait for her to finish a conversation with some people in order to come and remove dishes.

Had heard good things and while I was skeptical of any place that could charge $29 for penne ala vodka, I had no reason to doubt this place.The ambiance was up beat with great DJ music playing. Loved the overall vibe of the place. The food was awesome! I am a big foodie and through business dinners am usually able to try all the great restaurants in the city and this will rank up there with one of my fav Italian places. We started with the signature ricotta meatball for an appetizer (amazing). My husband ordered the branzino and I initially ordered the rock shrimp risotto. My husband loved the branzino, but the rock shrimp risotto was not what I expected. It was beyond cheesy to the point that even as a cheese lover it was too much for me. I never send a dish back, but my husband insisted that I say something to the waiter and being 6 months pregnant really wanted to make sure I ate. The waiter couldn't have been more gracious, whisking the dish away, apologizing I didn't like it and said he would replace it with the gnocchi i was initially considering. 3 minutes later the manager of the restaurant was at our table apologizing that I wasn't satisfied with my entree and saying the replacement would be out shortly. 2 minutes later arrived my gnocchi that was beyond delicious - melted in your mouth. I asked the waiter for the Oreo zeppole for desert and he brought it out with candle and ""Happy Birthday"" in chocolate on the plate. Dessert was also incredible.

I also had mussels and clams last night that beneath it it had a drenched in muscle/clam juice and wine sauce large piece of toast... It'd didn't look appetizing at all but it was delicious. Everything I ever had the pleasure of putting into my mouth at this restaurant was nothing short of delicious. Looking at the rest of the reviews though it may seem like I don't get out much LOL which isn't true at all. The only thing I ever had here that I didn't like much was the pasta with the red sauce is usually too salty or bland tasting and some kind of chicken breast that kind of had a strange consistency that didn't feel like chicken to me to be honest, reminded me of chicken you get from the Chinese restaurant in chicken and broccoli order.. however, the spinach and mushrooms it came with were delicious and we also had some amazing baked Brussels sprouts with bacon that I seriously trying to figure out the recipe for. I could go on about the food but I think you get me. I loved all of it pretty much. And they also make good fried Oreos, just not as good as mine haaaa! I don't have any pics right now but I'll take some to add next time.Besides the food, it's a totally FUN vibe, definitely not for a romantic getaway for 2, but for a group of friends or couples looking to have an fun, energetic time, it's a blast! Once we finish the food at my table they take the table cloth off and you can dance ON THE TABLE! I'm not kidding. They give glow slicks and the glow neck rings and strobe-light ice cubs, Mardi Gras beads, performers... its a real circus in there but I like it.

5.0,1/15/2015,"I went for Summer Restaurant Week 2014 (I know, this review comes late) For my appetizer, I chose the Tomato Bufala Mozzarella Salad. It consisted of yellow and red tomato slices with mozzarella in between, topped with Parmesan-crusted crostini and onion on the side. Even though it was a simple dish, the presentation was lovely and I really liked the pop of colors. It tasted quite wonderful as well- Fresh, flavorful, and delightful.For my main course, I had the sliced strip steak with green peppercorn sauce. The steak, already cut was absolutely delicious- Juicy, tender with a mouthwatering sauce. The only complaint I had was that the meat had quite a bit of fat on it still and I prefer lean cuts of meat. The french fries had sprinkle of Parmesan and were skinny (just the way I like them), warm, perfectly crispy and incredibly good.My chosen dessert was the Oreo Zeppole with a Vanilla Malt Shake, while my friend had the Gianduja Budino, a chocolate pudding. The pudding was rich and extremely chocolatey but I preferred the zeppole. The oreo zeppole were delectable warm little morsels that melted in your mouth. The zeppole had an oreo filling with fried dough around it... They tasted sweet and perfect. The vanilla shake came in an adorable little cup with an oreo inside. The shake combined well with the zeppole, but each were delightful on its own.The service was pretty good, though it took awhile to get mayonnaise (for my fries) and I had to ask more than once. .",4,4,4,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

3.0,12/15/2014,"I always wanted to come try this spot being that I have been to their sister restaurants (Tao Midtown/Downtown and the Lavo in Vegas), so fortunately we came for a work lunch.  The restaurant was quite busy around 12:30pm, so I would be safe and make a reservation even though it has a large dining room no matter your party size.Getting to the food, we ordered some octopus, signature meatballs and calamari to start.  The octopus was cooked very tender and excellent, the signature meatballs were very flavorful and stuffed with ricotta and the calamari were ok.  I would highly recommend the octopus out of all we ate for the appetizers.  For my main, I tried the signature veal chop Milanese and it was ok.  I felt it was overbreaded for what you were paying for but the tomatoes and arugula salad on top of the chop were fresh.  If I would do it again, I would order something else for my entrée.  To finish off the meal, we ordered some fruit and fried oreos which were very good.  Overall, I would say the service was very friendly and patient with our large party so there were no issues there.  When it came to food, there were a couple of things I enjoyed but others that I didn't.  For what you were paying for, it is more of a ""sceney"" environment with average food.Buon appetito.",1,0,1,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263
1.0,12/12/2014,"It is unfortunate that I have to even select a star for this venue.  Our company holiday party was nearby and our after party was at Lavo for the second year in a row.  Last year my colleagues and I vowed to NEVER return due to the rude bouncers and security at this place, so this is what happened yesterday and I honestly cannot make this stuff up if I tried.  Two friends from work and I left our holiday and one of them insisted that we go to our after party at Lavo and I kept replying NOOOOOOOO.....he kept persisting since he hadn't gone last year and he wanted to mingle with our colleagues a little while longer and he finally wore me down and I caved.  We mention our company's name at the door and after flashing the wristband we were told we could go inside.  Downstairs our colleagues were on the other side of the dance floor and my friend who had really wanted to go went to go mingle with them while my second friend and I just hung out for a little bit by the bar..I had made it clear that I did not want to stay long and that I would stay for just a drink or 2 max.  While my friend and I are by the bar, we are both hispanic by the way, and yes this matters....two caucasian males by the bar who STUNK OF MARIJUANA...I mean they stunk, so it was obvious that they just smoked stood behind my male friend, and the one facing me kept looking at me while the one that was standing behind my friend I notice keeps getting closer to my friend.  So he turns around and complains that my friend bumped into him, and my friend apologizes and five mins later he turns around again, my friend tells him we are not looking for trouble and we step away from them and go to the table next to the bar to chat quietly, we must have been the best behaved and most polite pair in the entire establishment.   A black female bouncer  walks over to us and yells at us to leave the club, I KID YOU NOT...she proceeds to take my drink and THROW IT OUT...repeatedly tells us to leave while accompanied by a black male bouncer..I asked them calmly why we were being thrown out when we were the victims and one of the caucasian males that were harassing my friend was giggling which increased my anger, but I still kept my cool.  We are not disruptive, rude or rowdy indi, so why was this happening to us?We were thrown out of there...I have never been thrown out of any establishment in my life!  I do not cause trouble, I have never had a physical fight with anyone in my life.  It was 30 degrees outside and they refused to give me my coat, so my friend removed his blazer and that kept me warm.  When my second friend saw us being thrown out he rushed up to help us and he screamed at the bouncers and asked them to get my coat because I was freezing and they refused.  They proceeded to round up 4 large bouncers and take my friend behind closed doors and we kept looking for him as we did not know where he went, I heard him screaming ""THEY ARE HITTING ME IN HERE, PLEASE HELP ME!""  I banged on the door begging them to open the door with tears in my eyes pleading that they stop, we got the door open and my friend was being tackled by four large bouncers, and my friend is a skinny guy...I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES...my other friend tried to save him and was pushed by one of the bouncers so at that point we called the cops and they arrived with paramedics 5 mins later..we gave our full report, my friend had blood coming out of his hand and was in a lot of pain.  It does not end here my friends.  My friend asked that my coat please be retrieved and we were escorted downstairs by one of the four bouncers who hurt my other friend.  The rude coat check girl asks me what is the brand of my coat and I told her she should base her search on description and not brand and to please find it quickly as I was frozen from being out in the cold for almost an hour.  While I was trying to get my coat, a very drunk blonde woman goes next to my friend and tries to get him out of the way so that she could get her coat and he asked her to stop pushing him as I was trying to get my coat, she was trying to jump over him to get to me for some reason, and after he asked her to stop she SLAPS him, yes she SLAPS HIM so hard I heard the slap, I honestly could not believe this, it was like I was in a nightmare and I was trying so badly to wake up!  I am in my mid 30s and I can tell you that in all my 20s and the hundreds of clubs that I went to, I NEVER EVER was subjected to this type of treatment.  Needless to say my friend is suing, and he is in all his right.  If you value peace, happiness and your life, I highly suggest you never step foot in this place.  Have a happy and healthy holiday everyone and please be safe.",9,1,1,R.

If you don't want to wait in line and know that you want to go there for that night, just go online and buy the ticket for that specific DJ. It's the same price as the cover ($20 for girls) so you're going to be spending the same price either way and you can jump the long line of guys and girls trying to get in. The other times we got a table so we were treated nicer. The drinks are pretty expensive but you're also paying for the atmosphere. It gets pretty packed around 1am so I would recommend getting there around midnight go get some drinks, enjoy and then move out onto the dance floor. In terms of the food (from lavo brunch), their truffle fries are amazing as are their salmon and egg pizza. A friend ordered their spaghetti with meatballs and goat cheese.

1.0,8/15/2014,If there's a choose I would put no star. Very bad service. Out of the whole restaurant of empty tables this hostess put us at a table right next to the column and every other table has decorations but this table doesn't. It doesn't even has utensil or anything. After we finally ask to change a table they didn't give water. I would not recommend this restaurant to any of you. This is the worst experience ever! I've lived in New York City for 7 years and this is the worst restaurant I've ever dine in. Worst service!,2,0,0,Yuna X.,"New York, NY",0,4,6
3.0,8/13/2014,"Lunch at Lavo was not just tuna tartare and margherita pizza, it was a lovely time catching up and celebrating New York City Restaurant Week. The food was classic and straightforward, combinations that were expected and reliable. We had thick colorful tomato slices with too little creamy bufala and tuna tartare--bed of buttery avocado supporting chunky pieces of pink red tuna in a pool of dark acidic dressing-- for appetizers. I had the steak entrée. Its peppery slices were lost in sauce and accompanied by truffled parmesan fries. My friend had a little margherita pizza, delicious but straight to the point. There was also dessert-- light and colorful fruits with an adult strawberry sorbetto or doughy and greasy fried oreo zeppole with a miniscule malted milkshake. The service was pretty good despite the fact that the servers looked like they were having a good time being social with each other. Our food came out pretty fast, like we were being rushed in the large restaurant during our late lunch. I don't know if I would be back at a time other than restaurant week; the prices seem pretty steep for what is offered.",0,1,0,Randi E.,"Hoboken, NJ",388,155,456

4.0,8/5/2014,"I mean this restaurant is just great. They took a very late reservation I'm talking I booked 10 people at 9pm for a 10:30pm reservation (due to our flight delay). This restaurant was suggested by our hotel concierge Claudia- she looked at me and my party and said we would definitely have an amazing time food and atmosphere wise. Now, typically like a restaurant like this- you'd be more dressed NY chic but we were too exhausted from our delayed flight to change but they were not upset about it they had us seated at a 10 person rectangular table. Bread was awesome- garlic bread with a tomato sauce dip- we simply kept asking for more. Because it was late we obviously didn't eat heavy. Portions were great. Wine selection was superb. Appetizer was the Kobe beef arincini- amaze balls (no pun intended) and my entree was a salad -- like I said, Light. For a restaurant we had not planned on booking and getting great food by fluke. This place is not a force to be reckoned with. Con: The atmosphere is like a club to be honest especially on a Friday night.

2.0,8/3/2014,"This is an expensive italian restaurant in Midtown that also has a lounge/club in the basement beneath the restaurant. This review is for the restaurant for dinner. I had a rigatoni &eggplant pasta dish for $28 that was very disappointing. It was bland, boring, and only an average portion size. I would have been disappointed had it been a $10 dish at a budget italian diner so the fact that it was almost $30 did not make me happy. That being said, the chicken parmigiano at my table looked really good and was huge so maybe some of the other dishes are worthwile; for the price though I am not willing to take a chance on another dish.The one saving point for the dinner though was the double stuffed oreo for dessert which is essentially sweet, fried balls of dough with crushed oreos inside served with a side of ice cream. It was incredible and I had never had anything like it before. The chocolate cake was huge and looked good as well. I think Lavo may be worth going for dessert, but unfortunately the dish I chose for dinner was not good and too expensive for me to give Lavo another shot.",2,1,1,Kevin S.,"Chicago, IL",3,193,51

We checked with the menu and realized that two of us had been charged $2 more than the menu price and two others were charged $4 over what the menu stated. We told a server who tried to pass it off as tax at first, but then she went to do the math and then took it to her manager. They ended up overriding the meals to give us the correct price, but it makes me wonder if it was ""accidental"" or if they do that to all tables.

3.0,6/27/2014,"Honestly I love Lavo during lunches, but I was pretty upset that it didn't work out so well for dinner Sunday night. I made reservations for 14 people for my birthday for the Sunday Dinner Riviera Party. Yes, food is great. We all loved it. Waitress was amazing, she was one of the best waitresses i have ever had. BUS BOYS PISSED ME OFF. I'm sorry, but I still have food on my plate and I am STILL eating. Who are they to try and take my plate away? Oh, the entrees are coming out? Well I'm sorry I still didn't even finish my appetizers. On top of that they started to take away appetizers where those weren't even close to being finished. We still had 3/4 of a pie on the table and the other plate had about 3 slices on it. He started to take them away and I asked him what he was doing? He said he needed space for the table, so I told him OK, PUT THE OTHER SLICES WITH THE OTHER PIE. DO you know what the bus boy did???? PICKED UP THE PLATE FLIPPED IT OVER AND PLOPPED THE SLICES (upside down nonetheless) and walked away... Are you serious? They wanted to clean the table, but the 10 empty cocktail glasses where left on the table and we asked them to take them several times.After all that, I'm eating my entree now and RIGHT behind me (our table was in the back between the dj booth, POS system, and bar) the bus boy dropped the black bin with all the dirty dishes in it, allowing my back to get hit with some food/liquid i dont know what it was...... I got up and started to wipe my back.. and do you think if I even got an apology? No. Best part, was that they left that dirty black bin RIGHT UNDER MY CHAIR for what, 20 minutes until I asked the guy to take it away? When I asked him to take it away he didnt even understand what I was saying. He thought I wanted him to bring me something until I kicked the bin away from my chair.Honestly, I was really pissed about the whole bus boy incident, but I didn't let it ruin my birthday.

I don't care how much money you have.

No joke. NO ONE! Everyone, males and females, were on their cell phones. Even the DJs looked like they were highly disappointed with the crowd.Second, the crowd was ugly. No joke. I'm no Miss Universe, but I definitely know some of those girls flashing the money were butt ugly. Money can buy you a Chanel purse, but it definitely can't help your face.Third, the bouncers were jerks.  Some friends were on the guest list, got to the door, the bouncer just looked at them and told them they weren't on the guest list without even looking!

1.0,4/5/2014,"This review is for the nightclub only!My friends & I went out on a Friday night and had a terrible experience and I will not go back to Lavo even if it's the only club on planet earth! Basically the bad experience started at the door when the bouncer didn't give me a ticket as a confirmation for the ticket I purchased online. When I approached the bouncer at the door and said that I didn't get my ticket and my friends  did,he said that if he finds out that I tried to get in without a ticket I'll have to leave the club immediately. In other words,he blamed a me for not doing his job right. He just didn't have the right approach! Luckily,I had my email confirmation to show as a proof of purchase. Having hospitality experience and working in a luxury midtown hotel I can tell you a thing or two about customer service. Starting with bouncers to management,Lavo night club has no class and staff lacks professionalism. The same night,after about an hour of being there my friends and I just got a drink and went on the dance floor which was overly crowded but it's expected. Somehow somebody pushed me or pushed the ""manager"" (short,blond guy) who was walking around,he grabbed me and told me that I'm getting kicked out. He would not explain me or my friends why am I getting kicked out and I still don't know why did I have to leave the place. I assume that he thought that I pushed him or honestly I don't know what else it could be. Anyhow,I am a lady and I didn't want to argue with him or the rude lady who had an attitude of a post office clerk hating the entire world, so I just left feeling disrespected and pretty disappointed with Lavo. As I mentioned earlier,staff lacks professionalism and they obviously hate their jobs. Not only that I'll never go back also, I will never recommend hotel guests to the restaurant or night club.

I returned not too long ago for restaurant week with co-workers and was surprised to see the amount of food they give for restaurant week. I had the tuna tartare and it was delicious. It settled on a bed of avocados and for an appetizer they gave a lot. My co-worker ordered the mussels as an appetizer and they gave her an entire plate of mussels! at least 15-20 pieces and I was shocked! I ordered the salmon again and I feel like the portion of the salmon piece was smaller than I had last remembered it to be. As for dessert I settled with a slice of cheesecake. I left satisfied and fell into a food coma an hour later. It is worth it during restaurant week, but I think for a regular day this place may be a bit on the pricey side.",1,0,0,Victoria X.,"New York, NY",579,617,577

3.0,3/3/2014,Lavo brunch is a party on Saturdays and the dinner party Sunday nights. Unfortunately for us we were here on Sunday afternoon. We were seated quickly for a big party and we didn't have to wait for the entire party to be present which was nice. The garlic bread with marinara was really good. We ordered 3 orders. Highly recommend it. The main dishes came out cold and we had to send them back. This may be because we ordered a burger well done and they brought all the dishes out together. The penne vodka was delicious! Creamy goodness!! I highly recommend this for lunch or dinner. It's pretty big and can be shared. The Benedict has a truffle holindaze sauce and it's good if you like truffle. The burger was executed well with a side of truffle fries. I asked for Dijon mustard and never got any :( the almond crusted French toast was also very good. A bit sweet so it didn't need any syrup.

Luckily, I was wrong! I ordered from the Prix Fixe menu a salad (not your average garden salad- the apples added a nice touch. It was delicious!), spaghetti with fresh tomato basil sauce, and sorbet with fresh fruit for dessert. Everything was great!

He tried the tuna tartare, skirt steak, and this chocolate pudding (i forgot what they call it on the menu) dish for dessert.Like I said, I came here for lunch which is probably dramatically different from the dinner experience.

Yes, the food is delicious, but is it really any better than all the other countless moderately priced Italian places in the city? You're paying mostly for the ambiance and the fact that it's Lavo.

Not the whole cast but uncle niño (Vinnie's uncle) and he and his entourage were extremely loud. Sweet people. Introduced themselves and all but were just trying to enjoy dinner and each other's company. I got up to use the restroom, all the way at the end of the restaurant and saw so many open tables!! That's why they lose a star because of how unorganized this place seemed. Open tables and not the tables you can turn into large tables but booths and you have people sitting in a tiny cocktail table with prior reservations. People were everywhere. Walking to the bathroom and back was a mission cause of everything just seemed all over. The food however was amazing. That's why I just love this place. They have possibly the best garlic bread. It's served wrapped in foil with marinara sauce. AMAZING. I got the chicken Dominic which was very very good. My bf got the steak, he really enjoyed it. Cooked just as he asked.

The restaurant upstairs is owned by different management than the younger hip crowed nightclub so we sat in the bar, no waiting, no reservation needed and had the best steak we've had in YEARS!  The steak is dry aged and the flavor comes through.  Very tender. The sides are amazing and before we left we were too full to walk back to the hotel.  We didn't make it to the nightclub because we are over 29 and that's a much (approval needed) young entry.  No bother tho... went down the corner and found a pub to our liking.",1,0,0,Rebecca N.,"Lacombe, LA",26,34,14
3.0,10/29/2013,"This review is for the nightclub. I went here on a Sunday night during Labor Day weekend. I came kind of late, but I was able to get in quickly due to my friend getting bottle service. I was surprised to find out that they ran out of tables so they set us up at the bar. Once you get inside, you have to go thru a flight of stairs to get to the club. The club is moderately sized, with 1 large main bar facing the main dance floor and a smaller bar to the right. The restrooms are clean and there are enough stalls to where you don't have to wait too long.The crowd is pretty diverse. The DJ wasn't too bad; however, the DJ started repeating the same songs. Another thing that I wasn't too happy about was the pricey drinks. Even though I was in NYC, I thought that the drink were a little to pricy for a venue such as this.Overall, I had a ok time here, hence the three stars I've given. The bouncers, bartenders and servers are pretty friendly and nice, and I am intrigued to try out their restaurant during the day!",2,0,0,Jason P.,"San Francisco, CA",310,286,487
4.0,10/23/2013,"Night Club Review:I love Lavo! I can't say it enough. The bottle service is fantastic. I believe it's a minimum of $1,500 which is easily a bottle of Goose and Cristal. The bottle girls make sure your drink is never less than full. They even come with a giant foam cake and princess crown if it happens to be your birthday.I frequent the lounge often, so there is usually a security official who makes sure that other tables are not seeping in our table section. Example, the last time I went for my girl friend's birthday and this sworm of Russian tourists took the table next to us and kept seeping into our section of the couch. Usually there is a rule to have no more than 8 people to a table but they had easily 16. I wish they had enforced that rule a little more.Anyway, the dance floor usually fills up at midnight and is sure to be a good time!",0,0,0,Nicole K.,"New York, NY",200,35,8

A little much. Also, the tables are VERY close together and you will come across a few pompous asses with their stick thin Cartier love bracelet wearing fiancees (is that oddly specific enough?) who really just love to talk a little too loud for comfort.

But hey, what did you expect for one of the most coveted hot spots in Manhattan?So let's see, I've been to Lavo both for dinner and the infamous boozy brunch. As of now I prefer the pre-nightclub dinner scene as it is slightly less (stress the word less) claustrophobic and insane. Dress ""sexy"" or your chances of getting in will diminish greatly.The food is delicious... and no that's not the booze talking I promise. I am in love with their penne ala vodka. Oh and their garlic bread with marinara dipping sauce. I don't know what they lace that marinara sauce with but it has me barely resisting this uncontrollable urge to lick the bowl clean. And I do mean lick. With my tongue. None of this inefficient scraping with a spoon thing! I've also had their margarita pizza, crispy truffle fries, salmon fillet, baked clams oreganato, mozzarella di bufala and lobster fra diavolo. You can just taste the quality and freshness in all of their dishes which explains the price tag. I mean, they offer kobe meatballs. KOBE. BMS over 6. That's the marbling ratio, know what I'm saying? Some of the entrees are smaller than others but for me the pasta entrees are all guaranteed to stuff your belly to the point of lower body paralysis. Brunch on the weekends is just ridiculous (in a good way). The room is packed with gorgeous women (helloooooooooo nurse!) and men who are dropping around a thou a bottle of champagne just to watch them dance on top of any elevated surface they can find.

1.0,5/12/2013,"The place is not worth it. Don't bother coming here at all. I spent over $600 for a tiny piece of the bar, so that we can be all together. We couldn't get all in one cab so we took 2, and we arrived separate and within 10min difference.It was my friend Bachelorrette party and we came to NYC to celebrate it. The MANAGER of the place told me he will not let my friends in, because the doorman does not like them!!! DISCRIMINATION. You spend money on a freaking small place at the bar and just because someone does not like the way your friends look like will not let in, so that you have a good time. Really?!?!? ""The most upscale"" club in NYC. Not to mention the way we were treated. Not good at all though. I couldn't believe. The $630 I spent to get to the bar, was for absolutely nothing. And the most surprising thing is, that the manager of the place said he will stay by his doorman's decision (not letting people in, because he does not like the way they look). If this is not discrimination I don't know what it is. If this is the elite of NYC, NO THANK YOU! Seriously don't waste your time going to the most ""elite"" and ""upscale"" club in New York. The space is also very small. Capacity of 280. It gets so crowded you can't even turn. You can not walk, not to mention any dancing of any sort. You can forget about that, too.

1.0,5/11/2013,"Well, to start off the food is fantastic, no complaints there. I was at the Saturday Brunch, and around 3 pm we got moved to the other side of the restaurant and that's when the party started, but....Pass. This place mainly attracts the yuppie crowd. All drunkenly dancing to their mainstream hip-hop music, while waving their dumb neon glow sticks. As I'm trying to get through , people are blocking the way, and even when I let them know I was trying to get through, they wouldn't move, so I would either scream or just push them out of the way, and they seemed to be fine with being pushed, maybe because they knew they were acting like giant turds. By 6 pm people were already shitfaced drunk. I was highly annoyed, so I left. I got in for free because my best friend was on the list and was allowed to bring one guest, but personally I would never actually wait in line to get in, or pay the expensive cover. Its not worth it for me. I can't deal with a place where people are just gonna be straight up rude and obnoxious. I don't know what the Vegas location is like, but Lavo is one those things that should've definitely stayed in Vegas.Update: One of the bouncers is a POS, he didn't let one of my friends in, because he deemed her ""fat"", and he didn't let my other friend in who was let in ALL the time, because I guess he didn't like she was Latina, while her white, blonde friend was let in, even though she was rude to the bouncer.

5.0,4/30/2013,"This place is like my second home, and I'm sure while my liver might hate me my taste buds sure don't.Club - Thursday and Saturday nights are great given that you like EDM and can deal with a pretentious crowd. Champagne brunch on Saturdays has been my go-to on boring weekend afternoons. Doormen will be the typical assholes and good luck getting in without pretty girls and a table, but that being said, isn't it all about playing the system anyway? Dress to impress - as a joke to defy Lavo's strict dress code one night, my friends and I attempted to walk past in St. Regis slippers instead of heels. They didn't find it funny...but point made. Not to say I haven't had my share of bad nights here with drink spillage and unfavorable crowds, but my good memories of Lavo will most definitely outlast the bad. Food - I've had dinner here a few times and everything is yummy. Truffle fries, garlic bread are savory appetizers. The branzino literally melts in your mouth and a friend of mine comes back solely for the meatballs. I'm a big mussels fan but their mussels didn't strike me as anything extraordinary. However, as a raw bar-phobe, I'd have to say Lavo's selection tasted better than other experiences I've had. I'm pretty sure their most infamous dish is the fried oreos with vanilla milkshake dip - to die for.

I frequent the Lavo in Vegas, so I get the whole thing. There are ways to get in fast, there is an amount you have to be willing to spend (cover, drinks, VIP) and there are a ton of douchers/awful women inside. That being said, you can have a hell of a great time here. For such a small venue it doesn't get overcrowded and the sound/light system is bangin. Our table was tiny, but fit 6 people comfortably due to a mini upper ledge area (the ladies used it to dance on while I threw ice cubes on them). No one asked us to leave and the party was still poppin when my crew left at 4am (everyone but me was sleeping. Sober guy win!) Ladies, prepared to get CREEPED on after 2am.

5.0,4/13/2013,"This is review number 2 for the nightclub. Lavo is as high end as it gets on the desirable scale of nightclubs in NYC. It definitely attracts nothing but marquee type talent and celebrities from all over. Starting off with the door, you should definitely know a promoter who does night here, be a big spender which means buying bottle service, be a pretty good looking guy or female, or simply buy tickets online via pre-sale but be prepared to come dressed to the nine's as it is up the doorman to let you in. Just because you bought the ticket online doesn't mean you are getting in. Also i would suggest coming early because even on the nights that don't have guest celebrity DJ's the lines are pretty long to get in for general admission so between 10-10:30 is your best bet. The drinks whether it be beer or liquor are pretty pricey plus tip so you are going to be paying at least between $10-$16 a pop for a drink but the atmosphere and what Lavo provides is well worth it. It's the true club experience, go go dancers, great music, a packed dance floor filled with beautiful people, the women in the club are gorgeous all around. The dance floor will get packed so make sure you are with a group that can solidly mark off some territory and space so you can move around also dance and have a good time. I won't bad mouth the security but ease up on people taking pics and videos, they are having a good time and want to make their friends jealous and in turn their friends who may have ""deep pockets"" or access to ""Daddy's credit card"" will show up and spend a good amount of money so they can have the same experience, every1 one wins.

There are many big DJ names playing on the weekends, making the door a pain to get through, so arrive early if you're on a budget, however if you're planning to go here in the first place you shouldn't be.Beautiful crowd, used to be full of older wealthy men, but nowadays the venue seems to be attracting a younger crowd making it that much more enjoyable.

1.0,4/1/2013,"I believe this is my second negative review on Yelp, though I'm not 100% sure.  I have mixed feelings about taking the time to give a negative review when I could apply a positive one elsewhere, but, I feel this is well-deserved.I recently discovered that one of my favorite bands, Sneaky Sound System, was going to return to NYC, for one night only at a place called ""Lavo"". After all the convenience fees and processing fees, the tickets came out to about $37 per person, which was not too bad, considering places like Madison Square Garden often sell nose-bleed seats for over a hundred.The ticket said 11PM, and while often I might show up a little early to see an act, I figured this would be a more casual environment and that I could show up fashionably late and still see the show.  When I arrived with my friends, around 11, the bouncer told us to ""Just leave, and try back in a half-hour"".  Outside, I met a young man who had been waiting (against the bouncer's wishes) since 6PM, a huge die-hard fan who came from Washington, DC to see his favorite act for the very first time.  Upon our return at 11:30, the fan was still outside, and the band arrived shortly after us, and were, surprisingly, treated with the same disdain and disregard as the rest of us.  Meanwhile, a group of overly-entitled trust-fund babies who sauntered on by in their fur coats and baby-seal flavored moon boots were quickly ushered past all of us (and the band) and given high priority (and no cover charge either).  I assume they know the owner or one of them may have been blowing the bouncer. Simultaneously, I overheard the singer for the band whisper to her partner, ""Well, we flew all the way here, we may as well just go on in and get it over with.  Welcome to New York, right?"" and I was quite disheartened.I've met these guys before and they are generally up-beat, but the pretentious and self-important bouncers outside were literally about to ruin this concert for everyone for no reason other than to make their overrated club look that much more 'exclusive'.  And there really was no reason other than this - because they were inevitably going to have to let the band in and all the people who had purchased tickets as well, anyway, so why the wait?I interrupted the band members and apologized for doing so, but informed them that the young guy in front of the line had come all the way from DC and had been waiting to see them since 6PM.  I felt this was a good way to make a fan's day by forcing his favorite band to interact with him, and also, to cheer up the band themselves and remind them why they do what they do, plus, it's always cool to talk to one of your fave artists, so, why not?Eventually, the bouncers led us all in to the empty facilities where a group of zombie Barbie bartenderesses awaited us with soulless faces, as though they had been drained of all essence like those little muppet midgets in the Dark Crystal, if you've ever seen that film.I felt bad for them, especially the one in the corset whose waist girth seemed eerily proportionate to the bouncer's neck.  $17 for a well-drink just seemed a bit over-priced, even for this place, so I was content to ride on the buzz obtained from across the street, which, although similarly trendy and somewhat comparable in price, at least seemed to have a polite staff with a friendlier vibe.  The club soon grew thick with douchebaggery, so much so that my friend left before the show.The band did not take the stage until around 1:30AM (I have a feeling that this had more to do with the club than the band.)  When they did, I discovered that about 15 feet of the floor had been velvet-roped off for drunk idiots, most of whom had no idea who Sneaky Sound System was. And a group of bouncers who acted like their role of 'keeping actual fans away from the stage' was somehow integral to preserving the polarity of planet earth.I saw the young kid from DC being pushed back and forth by molly-rocked trust-fund kids, and I saw the bouncer grabbing people, and re-roping the area whenever someone would disconnect the ropes, and I saw Sneaky Sound System slightly begrudgingly perform a simple DJ set for their only night in New York.I actually was so disenchanted by the evening that I questioned my love and loyalty for the city altogether, as it seemed representative of the many changes to the island that have come in the past few years as the economy has squeezed out virtually everyone except for the filthy rich and daftly entitled. But, I won't let that one experience turn me into one of the jaded people who hate 'new' New York, at least not by itself.  I will, however, allow this experience to influence me to never step foot into Lavo again, unless there are some pretty bizarre and almost supernatural circumstances that bring me there, because overall, this club was the Jay Leno or Nickelback of NY nightclubs - i.e. successful despite cringeworthy mediocrity at best.",4,2,1,Simon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,0

4.0,2/15/2013,"Let's be real; a night club is a dating service for with men with money. Your $9 drinks are not keeping the lights flashing or bringing Swedish House Mafia through the door. It's paid for by the guys throwing $3000 at their table (stocked with $70 worth of booze lol). So in the context of such a dating service, it should not shock anyone that women the staff deems insufficient are being turned away and single guys without money (like me) are being chased away in droves. Complaining about any of the above is like complaining there are too many pop songs on the radio. That's what the radio does.So anyway, Lavo. I showed up with some girls, hoping they would get me in. They ran in ahead of me (doh!) leaving me sort of in front of the door. Still, we skipped the line, I paid cover, maybe $30.Inside, very cool, very flashy.

They play a good mix of music as well, hip hop, house, which you wouldn't expect at this traditional-feeling restaurant.My friend and I ordered the tuna tartare for appetizer which was very good.

I arrived there around 8:00 on a Sunday night. The space is beautiful. Problem is there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. It was practically empty. I will say by 9:00 or so, it started to get more crowded but was very surprised by the lack of a crowd at 8:00. The space is really nice, the staff is very attentive, but the food was very average. Between 2 people, we split the caesar salad, the spaghetti with kobe meatballs and the chicken parm. The spaghetti with meatballs was $34. I make better meatballs at home honestly. There was barely any sauce on the spaghetti and seemed undercooked. The meatballs were so average. The chicken parm was ok, but really nothing great and nothing better than a chicken parm I can get at the local deli. The salad was ok. Probably the best part was the garlic bread that they serve you warm when you arrive. With a bottle of wine, the meal was about $150 and it was nothing spectacular at all.

2.0,12/28/2012,"I have an interesting history with Lavo. A friend of mine is obsessed with this place and goes pretty frequently. She raves about the Thursday nights. I've gotten to the front door twice with her and been turned away. This is no shocker in NYC, a city full of beautiful women can afford to turn away patrons at the door. I am ashamed to say I went last night, since the group I was with was going. I expected a similar outcome but the LAVO Gods deemed me good enough to enter (No I did not lose 50 pounds and grow 5 inches, my friend knew the guy at the door). So the layout is awesome, sofas all around and then in the center a dance floor. The drinks are pricey but that is to be expected at a place like this. I'm not sure if Thursday nights are techno or that's all they ever play? Also for a place this difficult to get into, I was expecting a more good looking selection of New Yorkers. I mean not that the people were ugly but not much different from any other NYC club. I had a good time, but when I review places I like to take the accessibility factor of a bar/club  into consideration. Had I not been with my friend I would have never gotten in, in fact, history shows that even with her I might not get int; plus, the cover is 30 dollars, I didn't have to pay because she knew the guy at the door but if I had to I'd be a little annoyed. There is nothing special enough to validate a 30.00 entrance fee.All in all, would I go back if I was with her and didn't have to pay cover - yes, would I ever wait in line or dare venture there on my own -- absolutely not.

4.0,10/31/2012,"With Hurricane Sandy disabling power in the village, I trekked uptown in search of some semblance of NYC normalcy. Or at least a cocktail...  My friend recommended Lavo, which I guess is known for having one part as a lounge/club, and the other part restaurant. I usually don't have high hopes for nightclubby type restaurants (Beauty and Essex being one of the few exceptions), but with her strong guarantees (and not much else open), we chose Lavo. We went to the restaurant side, which is charming, dimly lit, and has the appearance of a Parisian Brasserie. However, the menu is pretty much Italian and steakhouse. A few of the specialty cocktails ($15) looked interesting, but I was still shivering from my cold shower that morning, and went with a nice toasty Malbec ($11). We got started with the famous garlic bread and the kobe beef meatballs. The garlic bread was so juicy, but not in a bad way, nice and garlicky, and not one bit burnt. I don't know how they make it so juicy - loads of butter? olive oil? both?? But we confirmed with certainty that it is not tofu making this garlic bread so deliciously decadent. Next up: the meatball. I think there were maybe 3 or 4 huge meatballs atop the plate, all oozing with cheese and coated with a rich chunky tomato sauce. This app is another must-order. My main course was the cheese ravioli, which was comforting, albeit slightly expensive ($22) and not really exceptional. The real star of the show here is Lavo's tomato sauce, which has a surprising quality and depth.As I headed out of the warm bustling restaurant into the foreboding darkness of my stricken downtown abode, I almost couldn't believe that a pitch black cold apartment was waiting for me. Lavo was a midtown oasis full of attractive boisterous patrons in suits and heels, proving that while we don't have hot water, or electricity, or a transit system, or working traffic lights, that we will get through this one with our typical city resiliency and our trademark ""never let em see you sweat"" mentality.",2,2,1,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",235,593,533

That being said, all table prices will be increasing for that date and solely entry to the nightclub itself will be $60 to $100 GA at the door so they won't be able to accommodate 25 people at a $3000 minimum.For your size table the minimum has to be $5000If the amount is too much we can look into moving venue. For example WiP Downtown - very high end nightclub with top djs as well just like LAVO and at $3000 we'd be able to accommodate your group there. Another option would be Skyroom - we could do $1500 minimum for your group.Please let me know and sorry for the inconvenience. ---------------------------------------So in essence, my business partners and friends have to change all of their nightlife plans as they were all under the impression that the contract was signed and good.  Now, we as planners look incompetent to our associates.THE HOST THAT DID THIS TO US IS:  Francis Mercier, I do not recommend trusting him with your entertainment...  ----------------------------------------",18,1,2,Michael F.,"Glendora, CA",431,52,0

Lavo is dead to me now.  I will never step foot in this place ever again. Made a 9 pm reservation for this place. Arrived at 5 minutes to 9. Was given a buzzer by the hostess and told to wait. Bought a few drinks in the crowded waiting area. 9.15 pm - waiting. 9.20 pm - waiting. 9.30 pm - my boyfriend goes to ask the hostess how much longer we will be required to wait for our 9 pm reservation. The hostess tells my boyfriend that one table is in front of us and it should be soon. 9.45 pm - still waiting. 9.55 pm - I go up to the hostess and ask how long I have to wait until my 9 pm reservation. She looks at a scrawled piece of paper and says ""there are three people in front of you"". Wow. Are you kidding me? From one table now to three in the space of 25 minutes? The pretensious b*tch had the audacity to tell me that my own boyfriend was lying to me about one person being in front of me. Some advice for you Lavo, in future DON'T TAKE A 9PM RESERVATION IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT PERSON IN AT 9PM!Furthermore, maybe hire some hostesses that actually have an IQ in the double digits, at the very least. They have NO IDEA. I don't care if this review is b*tchy or rude. My last night in NYC for this year was ruined by this place. I guess you can understand by my review that I didn't get the opportunity to eat here. I walked out at 10pm...1 hour AFTER my reservation was made.

Impressive- Branzino: didn't expect much from it but was one of the best dishes.

I have alot of Patience for people in the service industry and I always tip more than 20% but she deserved to be fired. I ordered a grey goose press and she did not know how to make it. Are you serious??? How the hell did you get a bartending job in the first place? Did you suck the owner off for your position? Then I asked her to make me a shot and if she could recommend anything and surprise!!! She could not reccommend shit. I proceeded to tell her a shot with certain ingredients and she huffed and puffed the whole time while pouring it. She was talking shit and saying it so I can hear her!!!

3.0,9/3/2012,"I have this real Love/Hate relationship with Lavo. LOVEI love the food. It's on an entirely different level to anything else I have ever tried. When you sit down for supper, they give you garlic bread with a tomato dipping sauce. It doesn't sound much, but it's the most perfect thing you will ever experience. I have begged for the tomato sauce recipe, but they refuse to give it up.The rest of the food is equally as good, the pizzas, the veal cotoletta, the pasta, the salads - I'm drooling as I type. The only thing I have found to be a bit ordinary was their signature meatball. I think there's just too much of it, and it's not as flavoursome as everything else. Or perhaps everything else is just so amazingly good that it's overwhelmed! HATEThe pretension, the sometimes overwhelmingly loud music they pump in, the queues to get in for brunch at the weekend, the clientele who go there to be seen. The table arrangements that pack in so many patrons that you actually need a stage director to rearrange the furniture when popping to the loo. The hostesses who make you wait ten minutes while they finish chatting. The wait staff who are so rushed off their feet that they can't think straight. On balance - go, do your taste buds the favour, but try to pick a time that all the wannabes aren't crowding in to be seen (and unfortunately heard) there!",2,0,0,Emma M.,"London, United Kingdom",2577,438,329

The entrees however were another thing....nothing to rave about. I had a four cheese ravioli and it was bland. Others got different steaks which were also just OK.

3.0,7/18/2012,"I went to Lavo when they just opened up in NYC,and I wanted to save my review till I let them settle in a bit.  We went there for a birthday party dinner.  Make a reservation, they will cancel it if you are more than 15 minutes late.  Depending on the time you choose to go there, you may be waiting up to half an hour to be seated, because people like to sit and chit chat.  Not such a huge deal, because a lot of popular restuarants are like that.  They give you a beeper to tell you that you are ready to be seated.  Kind of feels like TGI Fridays, and looks like it with its similarly colored wood paneling.  The garlic bread was great, but nothing you couldnt get from a local pizzeria.  Our table ordered the new york steak, lamb chops, and rigatoni, with side of fries, spinach and mushroom.  We asked for a 7 layer malbech, the manager on duty thought I was talking about desert.  Yeah, high end.  Anyways, all the food was extremely salty.  Everything else was prepared perfectly.  They brought out a cake for my friend, they had written happy birthday on it, which we appreciated.  Honestly the place isnt bad, but way too overhyped.  I actually ignored many of the reviews that said the same things I do, because I thought they probably had a bad experience.  For me from the first time I went, to this last time, its been the same experience.  Go here if you want to say you did Lavo.  There is a post that says you can be stamped in to the club if you eat there before, untrue.  They used to do that for certain guests they wanted in the club, but thats not happening anymore.  The club is bottle service only unless you know people or fit the aesthetic of who they want in there, so be prepared to spend roughly 1500 on a table.",0,0,0,S W.,"Manhattan, NY",21,80,15

Some people have said that they could be racist but I didn't experience that myself... Some guys complain about bouncers being reverse-sexist... Well I'm sorry but you should've known that about any clubs. If you want to increase your chance of getting in, get there early and go with more girls. 50-50 is definitely not going to work for Lavo.On a Friday night my friend (girl) and I got out of another event early, so we got there before 11. We got in with no cover, and the place was pretty empty at that point. A sex on the beach was $17 before tip... The place packed up within the 30 minutes around midnight, and I loved their music.I went with 2 girls and 4 guys on a Saturday night the next week past midnight. I got in free, the 2 girls got reduced admission ($20) and we could bring 1 guy, who'd still pay $30. The rest 3 guys can't get in even if they wanted to pay. This night the same sex on the beach was $13 instead of $17.Both times, doorman (doorwoman) were not friendly but definitely not rude either - just professional. What I like the best about Lavo is that people are much classier... at least on the surface. It's mostly banker-like guys and model-like girls. From a girl's stand point, you can have much more fun when you don't have to worry about people randomly grinding up on you or groping you.

We wait a bit, the doorman goes and talks to another man, perhaps another doorman or partner. The other man comes over and tells us, ""Do you have a reservation?"" No. ""Then sorry, you can't come in."" This is after a few random tourists in front of us got in just fine without reservations, and men behind us were offered bottle service and bar minimums.

Music was insanely loud but you definitely do not come here to have a chat. Music is all House and Techno beats which I can only tolerate for so long when not on a treadmill.  The crowd was undoubtedly very beautiful. The bouncers make sure to keep a flow of attractive people coming in who are willing to spend money. If you're looking for a supermodel boyfriend or girlfriend, this is your spot.

Yes, my C&W were $22, but in reality...the portion size was HUGE. Two fluffy waffles, bourbon syrup, PECANS! And 3 huge pieces of boneless friend chicken, no muss...no fuss, this was a deletable ""last meal"" in the States for awhile. Dusted gently with powdered sugar. Mmmmm, really very delicious. Paired well with a cocktail midday...hey, everyone else is partying, I'm starting too! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, we were seated in a comfortable corner booth, enjoyed a bit more people watching and left feeling much better. In Midtown, I'd say this is a hit. I've eaten many other places in this 'hood and not had the same sentiment. Yes a bit pricey, but portions match. I am confused though...this is a nightclub sometimes?

There is a DJ on sight bumping great, but awfully loud music. Don't even count on having an intimate moment of silence at any point in time if you come in the evening. The food was great! I had the margherita pizza (hand's down one of my top 5 samplings of this style of pizza), and sampled the 8oz kobe steak (I mean it literally melted in my mouth as I chewed!). I concur with all preious reviews of the garlic bread and dipping sauce. If that was the meal, I would be satisfied.  However, having a group of girls standing on their chairs and the table that they've been eating on dancing on in my periphery is not the best way I envisioned having my dinner. Nor having bright glow sticks (I hope he patrons brought them in and the management did not supply them) waving through the air. Don't get me wrong, I understand at night the people are probably getting ready to go next door to the club setting, but that was awfully distracting during dinner. The other minus was having one of the people from management asking why the tip was so small when we put everything on one person's card. We had every intention of leaving cash and do not understand why someone had to speak to us about it.With friends and great food anyone can make the best of a lack luster time.

For starters, get yourself a Kobe meatball appetizer - just do it, probably the best thing on there.  The calamari is delicious as well.  Frankly, everything on that menu is sort of decadent and delicious.  Lavo is red hot right now in NY, its packed during lunch and dinner pretty much every night of the week.  Its a pleasant break from Tao across the street which is just so dated and the food has gotten worse each year.  Lavo is full of suits, plastic looking upper-east siders, tourists, corporate folks, etc.  It's a bit of an older crowd than the ever-so-crappy Philippe located 2 blocks up.",1,1,0,russell b.,"New York, NY",37,116,0

Don't remember what my friends had but I recall them enjoying it. The service was a bit slow, but considering how busy they were it was forgivable. Our server was very nice as well. While we were eating, Father Time ( I'm talking could be my grandfather) decides to drop by our table and give me his business card. Telling me how he'd like to take me out, that he works in diamonds or something like that. Well grandpa, diamonds are not this girl's best friend......but just maybe I'm not the type to turn down a free meal......maybe.Anyway, flash forward to us having drinks at the upstairs bar. It's full with a very upscale crowd. Lots of men in suits, glam girls, eurotrash, even Cee-Lo walked by me. One girl stood out like a sore thumb. I can spot a bad weave a mile away, and the mess on her head was synthetic with so much hairspray that if someone lit a cigarette near her it was going up in flames. Outfit was from Hoodrats R' Us and she had that working girl look in her eyes. I've developed a keen eye for what these skanks of the night look and act like. No surprise a spot like Lavo would be swarming with them right. We spotted her other nights when grabbing food or drinks in the bar.I haven't been to Lavo in a few months due to our last experience. My friend dragged me out of the office one night when I was working late. We walked into Lavo and it wasn't busy around 9:30pm on a Tuesday night. We spotted the same girl, bad weave and all there but whatever. Be the best hooker you can be girl. At the bar we randomly chatted up this blonde chick next to us. After a few minutes she asked in a thick russian accent ""Are you girls working? I've seen you girls here a few times before."" WTF!!!!!  No honey, we're not. I'd rather use my brain and that degree I have in economics to make money. She tried to talk up how much money she makes a night and make it sound awesome, but still hell no. We moved to a table. Then we noticed it since it was so dead. About six of them were spread out around the bar area and they were all friends. My friend thought it would be funny to play Captain and save this poor guy from the clutches of the hookers. The head hoe in charge didn't take too kindly to that and asked my friend to step outside so she could talk to her. She walked outside with a couple girls and waits for my friend. We started to wonder if we were about to get jumped by hookers. The second we saw a window we got the hell out of there. Haven't been back since.Shame because I really liked Lavo.

Now to the review. We had a noon reservation and were seated promptly. I think the only think I liked about this place was the prosecco..not bad. Our waitress was nice enough, I did feel like at one point she was trying to rush us but not really sure why. Oh, the garlic bread and sauce they serve at the beginning was yummy as well. We ordered the tuna tartare and the beet salad to start. The tartare was exceptionally bland and not served with any sort of chip or food-scoop tool...snore. The greens in the beet salad were brown around the edges and very wilty..the sogginess could have also had to do with the overabundance of dressing gooped all over it as well. The beets were definitely from a can. I then had the chicken paillard which was easily the worst I've ever had. The chicken, even though pounded to oblivion was about the size of a dollar bill...what did they start out with...a chicken nugget? No worries though because it was bland and horrible. The ""salad"" it was served with was again, a few week old greens doused in dressing, oh and the fingerlings? I think there were 2 soggy ones.

It tasted more like white grape juice.  I cannot believe this place was packed. Then again, the crowd looked like the cast of extras from Entourage.  The redeeming factor was that our waitress was nice and the wine portions were hefty, but that is it. The space is so gorgeous, it is a shame it has been overrun by people with bad taste and failing tastebuds. My favorite was that the order of asparagus wound up costing about $1 a spear, and they were those delicate new little spears. Is the ""chef"" a hater of vegetables?I was appalled at the quality of food for price, and also appalled that so many people were gorging themselves here. It's gross.

2.0,1/25/2012,"The overall Yelp rating for Lavo is spot on. I had been so excited to eat here after hearing it was amazing from multiple people, but my party was pretty disappointed with our experience. To begin with, I had a reservation on a Friday night. We walked in and apparently there weren't any tables available even though we had a reservation for 9pm, so we were given a pager and headed to the bar for a drink. The bar was extremely crowded and it took us a while to get someone's attention. Finally, we were able to order and fifteen minutes later our table was ready. We placed our orders for what I thought was going to be delicious Italian food, since Lavo is an Italian restaurant. It's important to note though, that half of their menu consists of steak-related items. That should have been a warning sign. While we waited, our waiter brought out garlic bread for us to munch on, which was actually pretty good, but really oily. We definitely finished the entire basket though. When our food eventually came out, I was very excited to try my penne pasta with vodka sauce, I mean you can't really go wrong with such a simple pasta, right? Wrong! The ""vodka"" sauce was absolutely not vodka sauce, but basically marinara sauce. Not at all what I was looking for or desiring. One of my friends ordered chicken and alfredo sauce with linguini, since apparently Lavo doesn't carry fettuccini, and for his pasta, they just didn't put enough sauce. The pasta was bland and lacked flavor. My other friend ordered the salmon, which he thought was just alright, and he orders salmon quite frequently from restaurants. Despite all of the food problems, I would still have given Lavo a decent rating if I liked the décor. But I feel like Lavo failed yet again. Top 40, popular music was blasting throughout the place, so loud that we could just barely hear each other speak, and that still would have been okay if the décor matched the music vibe. But the décor of the restaurant is reminiscent of old school Italian comfort food. From the look of the place I would have expected opera music to have been playing throughout the restaurant. Overall, the vibe, the décor and the food just did not mesh together at all to produce a successful restaurant. I love the trendy restaurant scene, but this one just did not work. I'll stick to my tried and true Italian restaurants in the future, thanks.",2,0,2,Preethy K.,"Manhattan, NY",11,48,0

A lot of the NYC's elite, decked out up to their 9's, stopped by Lavo for a drink and a bite that evening. And me? Oh just rocking the latest Uggs (whatever, it's cold out there people!). Thankfully the hostess paid no attention to dress and decided to make us painfully wait as long as the other well-dressed people there :)So besides the wait & that kind yet odd gentleman near us who offered to let us sit at his table (""I know the wait is extremely long, you girls can sit with me if you'd like"" ""Well gracious sir, only if you pay for our meals too""), lavo was great! We were offered a free round of drinks because of our agonizing wait, thanks to my friend. Patience is not always a virtue ;)Lavo is actually a really big restaurant inside! It was bustling and full of energy as the rad girl DJ was spinning house beats a few feet away from us. Lots of people around us were ordering the 18"" flat bread pizzas and even though I wanted to, I went against my better judgment and ordered the salmon, which was drowned in butter.

I had the strawberry basil drink which was disappointing. It tasted like pre-made juice. We sipped our drinks as they were sloshed around by people constantly crowded around and bumping into each other, and we shouted to each other over the blaring club music. I had heard Lavo was a scene, but I expected it to be a full blown club late at night or at least on the weekends. I definitely came here with the wrong impression that I could have a nice meal in a trendy restaurant. It's a full on club experience that takes over every table in the place. There isn't an inch of space to breath or move and there is no way you can have a conversation. We painfully waited until 10:05 swearing that we would just give it 5 more minutes each time because the hostess insisted we were the next available table for an hour.

But no lie, probably one of the scrumptious burger and fries I've had (Then again what burger has failed me...I'm a fatass) From what I hear, their meat is supposedly good and it really is! Juicy burger with its all time best friends mushroom and bacon with a blanket of melted mozzarella. Their fries were seasoned perfectly with a garlicy taste with grated cheese. Only thing that seemed to be missing was honey mustard boo ;[  The Oreo Zeppoles were delicious but I dont really have a sweet tooth like that but everyone in the table loved them.

3.0,12/28/2011,"Went here for our department's holiday lunch last week. We could only get a reservation at 11:45 so we went kind of early, but glad we did. This place fills up, peoples. If you want to go for lunch I highly recommend going a bit on the early side. By the time we left at a little after one, the place was packed and there were people waiting. My general feeling about the food at this place is it's an actually good Olive Garden genre of food (likeable but unremarkable Italian). Of course, topped with a hefty price tag. And I don't mean this in a bad way- there is definitely a market for this and it's not a bad choice when you're craving some Italian but not feeling overly picky. First they serve you this garlic bread, that as other people have mentioned, is pretty awesome. It's soaked in butter and garlic and then they have this little bowl of marinara to dip it in. But again, very run of the mill. For the appetizer, we shared the HUGE (and I mean, HUGE) meatball appetizer as well as the zucchini fries (also HUGE). Both were super delicious but maybe a bit greasy. Would have loved a little bit of a lemon aioli or something on the zucchini fries... The meatball was smothered in ricotta, sauce and cheese. So, so good. I was impressed with how they were able to keep it moist and tender throughout- I'm guessing it spends a long time in the oven. I had the burger, as it was one of their specialties... It was good but not anything I would come back for. The burger was cooked how I had requested, and it was topped with cheese, tomatoes, the usual suspects.

Eggplant Parm appetizer is HUGE and doused with marinara sauce...actually so far...everything has been...6. Calamari was kinda chewy for me, I wouldn't recommend.7. Baked clams are yummmaa yummaaa - think of the garlic bread minus bread plus clam.8. The sea bass entree for me was just a hunk of fish and some tomatoes (b/c I requested no mushrooms because they are icky). Some parts of it was SLIGHTLY too undercooked and I don't like fish well done either. It looked kinda small on the huge plate, but actually is a fairly large serving.9. I was really excited for the truffle fries....but they're kinda soggy! I liked the ones at Capital Grille better.10. The zucchini fries come in a freaking HEAP. There are just a lot of them and they're greasy as well. Sadface.11. Fried oreos are TO DIE FOR. Ugh. If I could never gain weight, I'd just eat these things every day. It comes with a side of semi melted ice cream for dipping. Love.12. Strawberry shortcake was just okay. It's more of this hard shell with strawberries and some cream. 13.

This is actually my first review on yelp, though i've been to a bunch of establishments throughout manhattan and the one thing i can say is to treat others the way you want to be treated.

1.0,12/4/2011,"Where do I begin?  First of all, my friends had planned to come to Lavo for a while, but we needed a hook up to even get a reservation.  We were told that if we weren't there on time with everyone, our reservation would be given away (which I thought was nerve to begin with).  We were also told that we MUST BE up from the table by 10pm.  I don't like to be told how long I am allowed to eat.  I am a paying customer.  We show up at 7:25 for our 7:30 reservation and we are asked to stand on a long line for our table in the freezing cold.  I guess I should have taken that as a sign.  Who has to wait outside for dinner?  Apparently, they only open their doors at 7:30, although it was more like 7:35 when the doors were finally open.So, we sit down (all 5 of us) and they eventually bring us bread.  (the highlight of the meal) and we ordered a few appetizers and ask for another bread (later to find out that they charge $6 for the extra bread).  Kind of rude, but I guess $6 isn't too bad considering how expensive this place is.The waitress was basically rude.  All of our food was mediocre at best.  BTW--the waitress recommended one of the most basic pasta dishes as the best on the  menu and it came out with the pasta barely cooked.  The ravioli dish is 26 dollars and you get 4 ravioli.  One of the chicken dishes came up completely different than what was described on the menu.  I had Chilean Seabass, which was ok, but nothing great.  Long story short, the bill comes and everything (with tip) was $500 but the icing on the cake was hearing that we may have to wait in line for the club, which is next door.  We go next door, and bouncers are SO rude and say that if we don't have a reservation for the club, we wouldnt get in and we get one chance.  If you're rejected, leave!  SO, you pay 500 dollars at your stupid restaurant for mediocre food and then get rejected from YOUR club.  SHAME ON YOU LAVO!  Do not go to the restaurant or club (unless you want to pay top dollar for mediocre food).",3,0,1,Abby M.,"Queens, NY",75,3,0

(although the guys who checked our IDs inside were actually very nice) I had the worst experience with the bouncer here ever and it wasn't like I was trying to bring in twenty guys.. I was with two cute girls!!! wth..The scene is a mix of weirdos trying to grind on you and pretentious european model types who don't dance at all, just stand around taking up space on the dance floor. Weirdly dressed go-go girls. They have a serious problem here with crowd management/flow of the dance floor.. The music is already mediocre, so it takes awhile to get into a groove, but as soon as you do there is someone pushing through the dance floor trying to get to the bar, bathroom, etc.  Seriously, people are CONSTANTLY pushing past you!! As much as their dry ice spraying robot girl is amusing and I did enjoy the temperature cooling effect, it gets super creepy when she over-sprays it. You literally can not see five inches in front of you. The dance floor fills with a white fog and ANY ONE can touch you without you, and you have no way of  being able to see who it is! not cool.

3.0,11/10/2011,"I'm really sorry, my experience was excellent until I opened my doggie bag of leftovers in the daylight today. So, the story begins with a vegetarian girl who walked into a very happening bar/restaurant with lots of stylish people, who was enjoying the people-watching and her Pilsner from Prague, until her penne alla vodka arrived. She had a couple of bites, found something chewy in it, and asked the server whether there was a chance that the meat had made its way into her pasta. Server assured, ""I promise, there's no way. We have way too many people ordering a vegetarian penne alla vodka for the kitchen to make that mistake."" Comforted by her confident reassurance, I proceed to enjoy my pasta in the dim lighting just ignoring the ingredient I don't recognize. But when I open the box in daylight to heat my leftovers for lunch, I know what I'm looking at - ham. Sure, mistakes are made, but when it's such a big one and there is no follow-up or double-checking, makes me guess the service and training at a premier venue such as this.

The meatball dish was spectacular, massive meatballs, they were just amazing.We ordered the pizza, the eggplant and some oysters as well.

4.0,10/28/2011,"We had a business lunch for four here recently and enjoyed it tremendously.  First, the main dining room is very comfortable and attractive.  Nothing trendy, just pleasant and the tables are well-spaced.  Service was quite attentive - thirty seconds after we were seated our server asked about our water preference and then the oft-mentioned garlic bread appeared (and then quickly disappeared!).  That garlic bread is amazing.  It is piled with fresh garlic, butter and parsley and is both crunchy and tender.  it is great on its own but even better with the highly seasoned marinara that comes with it.  We split the Kobe meatball as a starter. It lived up to the hype.  It was tender, beautifully seasoned, and its texture was perfect.  Again, that marinara is perfect.  We each had a separate entree.  I had the veal Milanese, which, while pounded very thin, remained on the bone, a very nice and unexpected touch.  The veal was juicy and tender, and it was covered in a lovely, beautifully dressed salad of arugula, red and yellow cherry tomatoes and parmiggiano shavings.  Mmmmm.  I brought half of it home for lunch the next day - portions are generous here!  One person had the chicken Parmesan, which she loved.  Another had the pasta bolognese, which looked and smelled fantastic and elicited sounds of happiness.  Our other colleague tried to go healthy with the tuna steak, which he seemed to enjoy.  We split the Oreo zeppole for dessert.  I had originally protested in disgust at the idea thereof, but let me tell you, that is one seriously good treat.  Especially when dipped in the little vanilla milkshake that accompanies it.  Do I lose my foodie status for admitting that I loved this?  The cappuccinos were excellent, as well.This place is not cheap, but to its credit, the quality of the cooking is superior.  I would go back without hesitation, even on my own dime.",0,2,0,Steven H.,"Madison, NJ",384,478,2568
4.0,10/28/2011,"I went from zero to hero in about 2 hours. The beginning of my tumultuous night: I got off the subway and was slammed in the face by a category 2 hurricane- horizontal rain pelting my face and my umbrella flipping inside out at every block. And then I got lost as hell, because I'm never in this area but finally make it into the restaurant. But wait, I don't see my gf's in the dimly lit bar area. And since when was Lavo Asian themed? I'm not wearing my glasses so lemme walk around the bar and look at each person's face from 2 feet away to find my gf's. Oh waiiiiiiit a second. Is this...? Am I...? I walk outside and look up at the awning and in bold letters I see 'TAO'...not Lavo. Dumbass. I walked across the street into Lavo to find my gf's tucked in the corner waiting for me, with good reason because the bar was packed like sardines. So here I am, dripping wet with frizzy gremlin hair asking the hostess if our table is ready yet. The super hip, I'm wearing bug eyed glasses and neon colors but I'm so hot I can get away with it hostess. She tells me our table isn't ready yet, but soon. MORE than an HOUR goes by before we get our table and we are piiiiiisssed. Arriving at 6:15pm for a 6:30pm reservation and then being seated at 7:40pm?! Oh hell no. By the time we got seated it was clear on our stank faces that we were not happy. Our waiter was super cool though- talkative, friendly, and relaxed. Which is a feat on its own seeing what a circus Lavo is. It's packed to the gills with people flaunting their money and soulless hostesses who don't do a thing but stand there and look pretty. After a round of comped drinks for our delayed table, we started to loosen up. And then the food came and everything was okay again. The $26 salmon was deliiiiicious; the sucker was cooked perfectly and the sauce was so light but creamy! With a side of $10 parmesan garlic truffle fries and the 'Fragole' cocktail with strawberry puree I was in fatty heaven. But then guess who walks in and sits right next to us? Yankees' CC Sabathia. Dude is BIG. And it's pretty hard to miss him in a room full of white corporate clones. Just saying. So we're like hmm..okay, cool. Food's good so shrug. BUT THEN guess who else walks in and sits next to him? Mr. I date blondes only until recently Jeter himself. Finally, we finished our meal and realized why it took us so long to get our table- because no one leaves! People here liiiiinger. Even our waiter admitted without regret that a reservation doesn't mean jack here.We ended up having a great meal but I wouldn't come back earlier than 9pm for dinner again. I'm not sure if it changes later at night but there were way too many snotty, older people who probably just got off work. It definitely wasn't our crowd. And it was too bright for such a loud place. But that's just me.SO...even though my gf's hated me for forcing them to wait over an hour for a table when we had a reservation, they thought the experience was worth it.

3.0,10/26/2011,"This review is based on the club.First of all, I give alot of credit to marketing team behind this establishment. They really have made this place a treasure box that everyone is dying to break into.At the door, expect a mosh pit of models,  eurotrash, and gold diggers  begging and crawling over each other to get in (with many getting denied entry) Not too many places deny so many beautiful women on any given night. Once inside, the club itself not special & unique in any way, It is no different than any other club. If it's your thing, the one thing that might make this club special is the high chance of seeing someone famous. Personally, I can care less. The staff is very professional & the decor is not bad. The music was your typical top 40. I do not have any complaints about the night I was there.If you do not have a reservation, do not expect to get in. There is an extremely small chance of getting in if you get there when they open. If you an do get in or have a reservation, expect to pay a ****  load of money. I can not stress the risk you will be taking if you decide to go without a reservation. The club is not in the proxomity of many other places, and it will be like being stuck in Siberia if you are denied entry, Well... there is always Tao across the street owned by the same owners.",3,0,0,John P.,"New York, NY",6,83,79

Came here after work with some co-workers and the place was packed with good looking men.  And yes, the majority of the people were men.Food is ok.  Let's be honest. I ordered $12 truffle fries and had high hopes, only to be disappointed.  They were very salty, not very crisp, and just overall not amazing.  The broccoli rabe was a little too oily with a strange salty kick for my taste.  The polenta fries also left a lot to be desired -- 4 large chunks of deep fried polenta that lacked flavor.  I took two bites and left the rest -- which is saying a lot if you knew how much I love any variation of fries.We ordered a pizza, which was delish.  And like everyone says, the garlic bread and marinara dip is pretty amazing.  I also ordered a beet salad which was very good.For dessert we ordered the dark chocolate bread pudding.  Both my co-worker and I were saddened by the lack of dark chocolate. Mostly croissant and very dry.  Again, for the scene it's great.  For drinks, it's great (if you don't mind being packed in around the bar like sardines and yelling at the person you are talking to).

3.0,10/9/2011,"3.5 / 5 stars, because the food is incredibly underwhelming, and the music downstairs didn't really cut it for me and my cool hip hop swag friendz.FOOD - The food was incredibly underwhelming. I had read yelp reviews before coming here, so we ordered almost everything yall recommended.  KOBE MEATBALLS - super good. actually rly dericious! very tender and moist, the sauce was just enough. not overdosed in marinara sauce. perfecto!PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - i freaking love parmeasan truffle fries. so I was incredibly happy that this place not only a. offered them on the menu but b. did them right! However, if you ask for some ketchup, it only comes out in this tiny tiny cute circular dipping container. it's enough for regular people, but not enough for ppl like me who love ketchup.GARLIC BREAD - Really good, almost lives up to expectations. The only thing is I wish they had less garlic. After I scraped off the excess garlic, then it tasted GREAT.BABY ASPARAGUS - I love asparagus, and baby asparagus is great bc to me its a combination of my two fav things: asparagus and stringed beans. YUMS!TUNA TARTARE - I'm not a tartare fan, but my friends really enjoyed it.OREO ZEOPPLE - For thos ethat aren't from the south, I guess this is a delicacy. It was made fine. everybody loved it, but to be honest, fried oreos are a staple where I'm from, so it wasn't anything special in terms of taste. But it definitely was special in terms of price. we can get a plate of fried oreos for $5!!The not so memorable: KOBE RICE BALLS were not as good. Maybe bc I'm not used to eating rice with crumbly (kinda dry) meat and green peas, but it just wasn't that great really. BRICK OVEN SALMON - covered with breadcrumbs, garlic and butter with greens underneath and sauce around it. In concept, it sounded AMAZING. However, the salmon came out. Firstly, I was disappointed by the portion size, I've had larger salmon filets at other restaurants for less than the price here ($28). and secondly, the salmon was a bit on the dry side. Even I can't make dry salmon when I bake it at home!! That's not cool. :( SERVICE / ATMOSPHERE - the service was great. Our waiter, an asian dude with a cool orange watch, was super great, and recommended the better dishes: Kobe meatballs and the OREO ZEOPPLE. There's a DJ in the restaurant that plays music, and it gets super loud. Staff was excellent. We were taken care of generously. ******* THE CLUB (downstairs) *********The club really gets busy around 12 midnight. There's a buncha tables around the upper floor, and then theres a small ish dance floor. They have girls in different outfits dancing on these raised pedestal things throughout the night, and also had these silver robot looking ladies coming out and every once in a while will spray cool misty air into the crowd (very cooll). However.... the MUSIC. I have an issue with the music. I literally recognized only 2 songs from last night. Adele's Rolling in the Deep. and Journey. Everything else was house and electro / trance type music, which to be honest is not my scene BECAUSE HOW DOES ONE DANCE TO THAT TYPE OF MUSIC???! Gimme some hip hop, plzzz. Anyway, the club itself was fine. Great decor, nice bathrooms with mints, lotion, perfume, etc etc to use for the ladies. Drinks are fine. If you get table service and you try to make your own drinks, your server ladies stop you and make it for you. I get the service that comes with having a table, but i dont like the way other ppl make my drinks (because I'm super weaksauce). Fine club though.

I'm guessing though that some of those girls are just trying to distance themselves from the garlic bread.The crowd was a mix, especially since the deejay was setting up while we ate. In addition to models, middle aged business dinners, younger groups obviously there for restaurant week, and people who were attractive and expensively dressed enough to be famous but the lights were too dim to be sure, I saw more than one man under age 30 wearing suspenders without irony.I went here with some out-of-town family. It was waaay too loud for conversation across the large round table, but everyone pretty much stopped talking once the food came. With eight people, we had a little of everything. Portions were generous so there was tons of sharing and sampling. Everything was good or great. The meatball was heavenly. Their tomato sauce is really out of this world. My aunt took took the bowl served with the garlic bread and then refused to share.

THE. SPOT.  i don't know what magic powder they sprinkled onto the pizza but i was in loooove~ I'll be honest, im not a pizza fan, but when it comes to lavo's pizza, i cannot stop eating.  it was very flavorful and not in a form of a grease pie.  they do have cheese on it, i don't remember what kind though.  either way, i would def recommend trying.  Also, if you're a fries person, definitely order the garlic and parm ones, as i've mentioned before, they have the best garlic bread, so as expected, their garlic fries turned out to be spectacular as well.i also went to lavo for RW recently to actually try a normal meal.  the portions were overwhelming for lunch! nice value for the buck.  however, the choices were nothing special.. i had the ceasar salad, grilled fish, and strawberry shortcake (you can check out my pictures) presentation was nice, quality is def top notch, and service was alrighti will say that the atmosphere there is a little intimidating.. but hey that's what you get when u pick a nice restaurant in midtown.  nevertheless, i would like to go again n try some specialty dishes.ps. definitely make a reservation before going",0,0,0,Kelly C.,"Marlton, NJ",270,418,674

The food: family-style meals that are overly greasy and have the taste of Olive Garden but the price of an overpriced Manhattan restaurant. The chicken parm was a chicken the size of Texas swimming in a bath of sauce and cheese/grease. Literally.The ambiance: overly glam. People come to Lavo dressed to impress. I'm not talking black tie; I'm talking skin-tight dresses, 4 inch heels, and hair all done up.

4.0,6/14/2011,"So I ventured to Lavo For my Birthday party. We were a party of 6 with a late night reservation of 11pm. Yes, It was late for a dinner reservation, but the plan was to venture to the Lavo lounge thereafter. We arrived roughly 10:55 all my party in tow( thanks to telling everyone the reservation was for 10:30, a trick u learn when planning for groups). The Hostess provided us with the standard beeper. Upon walking up to the restaurant, we did notice the line was already forming for the lounge, which ran the gamut from model types to Bridge and Tunnel people. Well I was a bit hungry and was definitely ready to get my drink on. So the only unfortunate part of the evening was the wait. After it already being a late reservation, we did not get seated until about 11:40, apparently our table was not ready. But we did partake in libations as we waited. So it definitely helped the wait. :-). Now to the important part the food: Can we say delish. They provide the table with a warm garlic loaf with bits of garlic and a marinara sauce for dipping. The bread was so yummy.. We started off with calamari for an appetizer. Everyone enjoyed it immensely because it was fried with a very light breading. And I am a girl who loves her fried food piping hot. So onto the entrees: I had seafood Alfredo, which was delish. I am always apprehensive ordering Alfredo, since it can be laden with sauce losing the ingredients. BUT not at Lavo, the sauce was present but a dash and it was seasoned so well. I had scallops, shrimp and I was in heaven. The pasta was cooked al dente and I was happy. The others had the spaghetti and meatballs which was made with Kobe beef. I believe they were all very happy with their meals. Also another one of my friends had salmon with zucchini which was shredded to resemble pasta. She cleaned her plate. In addition another had the seafood cabonara, which he loved. And also an order for their minestrone soup was well received as well. We were all very pleased with our meal. In addition we did have a bottle of Riesling for the table and being the birthday girl I did have one of their signature drinks which I loved which was some peach concoction but at that point my Yelp hat was off and I can not remember the name. LOL AS for dessert. when I booked the reservation I did inform them that it was a birthday celebration. When they called to confirm they asked if I would like a candle to celebrate, UMMMM YES!!!!. And that they did, I wanted to try the chocolate bread pudding but they were out instead they blessed me with a great Yodel type cake and also the fried Oreo zeppole with their own milkshake for dipping.

Service was good with a nicely matched wine recommendation.

Anyways.. to each his own as they say. Onto the restaurant...This is a typical post work midtown restaurant. The food is decent but nothing to write home about. I came here with 3 other co workers and we shared oysters, fries, kobe rice ball, meatballs with ricotta, special squid ink pasta, chicken marsala and the ny strip.

3.0,5/18/2011,"This review is for the restaurant: The reason I give this place a 3 is because although the food was delicious and the portions were large, the service was not that good and the seating was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! I wanted to have a nice romantic dinner with my BF and literally was so close to the couple next to us that his elbow almost hit me in the head. There is no privacy, the tables were placed way to close and tightly that in order to get up and go to the bathroom you need to ask the couple next to you to move their table over a smidgen. We sat down and were not given bread until 15 minutes later. We ordered our food and the appetizer came and then we waited almost 40 minutes for our entree, maybe longer. I was so hungry that the couple next to us (who came in after us) got their food first and were already stuffed from the appetizers that they offered us a slice of the pizza (which was delicious). Our waiter was nice but some guy (I'm not sure if it was a manager or someone of higher status than the waiters) came by and literally moved our dishes over so that they can fiddle with the table next to us (not even cleaning the table before seating the couple). I over heard a few people complain about how tight and ""pathetic"" the seating was. One waitress had to reach over one couple in order to give the guy sitting next to me his clam dish. Mind you it was super hot and he had to grab it from her (because she couldn't get to the table). The food was amazing; we had the clams, porterhouse for two, fried zucchini and Pinko Parmesan fries.

The meat and sauce were good and nicely seasoned, but the meatballs were overcooked. Next we had scallops that came with white beans. The scallops were seared and had pesto sauce on top. The scallops were fresh and the pesto and beans were a good touch. The garlic bread that came with the meal was good, but nothing special and the marinara sauce for the bread was OK.The Kobe beef rice ball had a crunchy outside but a meaty, soft inside. The polenta fries came as 4 pieces that were crunchy on outside and creamy on the inside. It was a little too salty, though. The pasta with carbonara was good, but the sauce was too thick. The lobster pizza came with potatoes on top of the pizza and the crust was thicker than traditional NY style pizza. The lobster was good but the potatoes were out of place. The sea bass was overcooked and dry on the outside. The broccoli rabe was also overcooked. A little spice would have gone a long way on the rabe.When we were first seated the music was techno/house, which is fine if you are in the club downstairs but for dinner, I felt like it was a little too over the top.

4.0,4/8/2011,"Long before it made a name for itself among the city's media magnates - Gossip Girls - and the who's who of Page Six, Lavo seduced me when her pre-opening menus were posted on Grub Street.  That, of course, was September 2010.  And although it's taken me nearly seven months to get there, I finally made an evening out of Lavo.  Or, shall I say, Lavo made an evening out of me...Since I work in such close proximity to the restaurant, I arrived shortly after 5pm.  The first thing that I noticed, prior to the interior decor and just how crowded the bar area seemed, was how kind and relaxed the two hostesses were.  Aside from a couple of empty bar stools, there were a handful of vacant tables and chairs.  ""They're (the tables and chairs) first come, first serve,"" the friendly women replied.  The fact that I was taken aback by their breezy kindness may sound odd to you, the reader, but let me back-track and explain my thought process going in to this experience: aside from its red sauce-heavy Italian menu, Lavo (which coins itself as an ""Italian Restaurant, Nightclub, & Lounge""), and other similar concepts, typically don't hold a spot on my top five ""where to eat dinner tonight"" list.  Why?  Because, more often than not, the service sucks and the food/drink is overpriced.  The DJ music - yes, I said DJ music - is overbearing and, almost identical to a timed pre-birth contraction, you can feel the eruption of the bass as it overtakes the circumference your chair's cushion.  That, to me, sounds about as fun as getting caught in one of NYC's famous ""horizontal"" rainstorms, sans umbrella.  Although Miss T was an hour late in meeting me for cocktails, I was thankful to have a cozy cafe table in which to relax, sip wine, and people-watch.  My bar waitress made me feel incredibly welcome, despite being a solo customer taking up a 2-3 top table for nearly an hour.  I was incredibly grateful.  Moments before 7pm, my next round of guests, Emily and Bryan, arrived for dinner.  After I bid Miss T a hearty farewell, the three of us were whisked to a spacious 4-top in Lavo's grand dining room.While Em and Bryan decided to split a bottle of white, I chose to nurse my glass of Heron Pinot Noir.  Who the hell orders white wine with heavy, red-sauce Italian food?  No thanks.  And while the three of us got reacquainted and began to peruse Lavo's dinner menu, our server presented us with a basket of garlic bread and a bowl of warm marinara dipping sauce.Now I don't know about you, but ever since olive oil became the new butter, I've often wondered, in secret, of course - what the heck happened to the garlic bread?  Because, I swear to god, if I see one more flute filled with long, anorexically-thin bread sticks - or an accompaniment of olive oil that isn't *at the very least* blended that yummy chopped stuff a-la-Carino's, then I just may lose it.  Lavo, I applaud you.  Your luscious, garlic-y loaf reminds me of my mother's.  Em, Bryan, and I chose to split two appetizers and two entrees:Kobe-stuffed Rice Balls: These delightful, tennis ball-sized morsels packed a mean punch.  Beyond the crispy, golden exterior was a treasure trove of ground Kobe beef, green garden peas, gooey mozzarella cheese, and rice nibs.  The crown jewel?  Dipping each forkful into the shallow marinara ""moat"" surrounding each 'ball.   Tuna Tartare: Although every bit fresh, clean, and delicious, Lavo's tuna tartare appetizer was no match for the version that I had, recently, at BLT Prime.  Perhaps it the fact that both (versions) were constructed very similarly and utilized almost identical ingredients: tuna, avocado, micro-greens. I found the smashed avocados that were used to be unripe, yielding a dull flavor.  Also, I believe that there was a key savory/salty, textural component missing from Lavo's presentation.""Lobster Scampi"" Brick Oven Pizza: This specific pizza was ordered per Bryan's request and, I'm not going to lie, I was nervous.  Not only because of its $28 price tag (thank god we split this by three), but for the fact that, at least where I come from, fish/shellfish does not belong on a pizza!  I'm sorry, but how much nastier of a combination can you conjure up?    Well, leave it to Lavo to create a pizza, topped with fingerling potatoes and roasted lobster, that tastes better than your favorite ""safe"" traditional pie.  Aside from a couple of extra fish-y lobster bits, this brick oven masterpiece was a homerun.  Score!Spaghetti with Kobe (beef) Meatballs: As if normal, non-Kobe Beef meatballs weren't good enough, Lavo had to take this classic dish to the umpteenth level.  Literally.  How much more decadent can you get?  I was terrified to take my first bite.  What if I loved it?  Then what?  At a whopping $34/plate, I knew that I had a 50/50 chance of potentially treading in to a choppy abyss ... of addiction. And basically, that's what happened.  Love, at first - second - and one-hundredth bite.",3,5,5,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

Old men and plastic women shoving each other for a space at the tiny bar or at least trying to hold their own amid the hostesses and diners attempting to get to the much more pleasant and spacious dining room. I was there for dinner and thankfully, had made a reservation. Those hostesses have some amazing patience.The restaurant, fortunately, was a fantastic surprise of amazing food. The atmosphere is lively and loud, and the crowd is surprisingly young (20's, 30's) for midtown. The decor is like a glitsy McNally place- white tiled walls, antique mirrors and dim white lighting, but with an extra touch of gilded decor.First off, they have a well priced wine menu. Next, the garlic bread that comes before the meal is fantastic. I had the risotto with marscaopone and cauliflower and it was surprisingly complex and intensely flavorful. The roasted cauliflower and pignole on top added a great crunchy texture. We also had the creamed spinach, which was delicious, but a little more decadent than I normally take my veggies. We were too full for dessert.On our way out, around midnight, we saw the crowd waiting outside for the club. I have to say, I hope that the people INSIDE the club are a lot better looking than those who were outside. As my boyfriend noted, they all looked like the kind of kids from LI who move to the UES and cram 6 into an apartment.  No thanks.All in all, though, it's a good addition to the neighborhood.

I will say by 9:00 or so, it started to get more crowded but was very surprised by the lack of a crowd at 8:00. The space is really nice, the staff is very attentive, but the food was very average. Between 2 people, we split the caesar salad, the spaghetti with kobe meatballs and the chicken parm. The spaghetti with meatballs was $34. I make better meatballs at home honestly. There was barely any sauce on the spaghetti and seemed undercooked. The meatballs were so average. The chicken parm was ok, but really nothing great and nothing better than a chicken parm I can get at the local deli. The salad was ok. Probably the best part was the garlic bread that they serve you warm when you arrive. With a bottle of wine, the meal was about $150 and it was nothing spectacular at all.

All in all, it's not terrible. More of a novelty location filled with non New Yorkers looking for something upscale and Italian Mod. There is better food and better service elsewhere throughout the city.",3,0,0,Lexi -.,"New York, NY",96,200,70
4.0,11/23/2010,"I am updating my original review from when I claimed that Lavo has bed bugs:I had a client lunch at Lavo (11/22/2010).  The food was excellent, the atmosphere was comfortable, and the service was ehhh...My clients and I had bites all over our legs after our lunch.  Given that New York has a major bed bug problem and the time of year, we thought we had bed bug bites.   It took a while to get answers from the staff, we went inside and spoke to the people at the front, I called the main line and left a complaint, and called back the next day to follow-up.  The responses from the staff was unusual- claiming that the bites mosquito bites from manholes and the subway.  It didn't make sense given the time of year...The other day, I received a message fro the manager on  Yelp requesting that I contact him for a full explanation.  This morning I did just that and he spend almost 20 minuets explaining the mosquito problem, and what they are doing to solve the problem.  He even offered to show me the space and contact their exterminator directly. As I mentioned in my original review, I really enjoyed the food.  I believe the manager and will try Lavo again in the next few weeks after the mosquito problem is fully resolved.  It may have taken a few days, but the manager really went above and beyond to assure me that everything was okay now and that it's not a bed bug problem.  That shows me that they truly care about their customers and their dining experience.  I appreciated the conversation very much.  Thank you for putting my mind at ease.  Hopefully this mosquito issue is resolved by the next time I am there so that I can give you what I would have liked from the beginning, full five stars. I applaud Lavo's efforts to reach out to me and put my mind at ease.",5,2,1,Elizabeth Y.,"New York, NY",50,11,1
3.0,11/20/2010,"I went here for a pre-birthday gift to myself, with a few friends tagging along. Luckily we knew one of the hosts because the front bar area was crowded to the point of silliness. The restaurant is so happening, which means it will be out of vogue by St. Patty's day. But for now, I felt...well, good being there in this day and time. The food was really good, with huge portions (although they can lay off the salt shaker). The service was swift and the prices were not exorbitant.

First of all- raw tuna should never be warm. Appetizers- the meatball!!

5.0,11/20/2010,"I've now had the opportunity to dine twice at Lavo. On our first visit, for a birthday gathering, the place was very crowded, on a Tuesday night. The group I had brought with me was larger than what I had made reservations for, but Lavo nevertheless accomodated us, with only a 15 minute wait. The food at Lavo is quite good. The garlic bread provided at the table was flavorful. The meatballs were succulent. The spaghetti carbonara was fantastic. Admittedly you can find pretty good Italian food at other places in the city, but if you want a combination of the top notch cuisine, with solid service and a nice ambiance that draws a good crowd, Lavo is the place to go. On my second visit, where I was seated right away without a reservation (got there early, around 6pm), the overall experience was similar. I recommend you go check it out.",0,0,0,Rick S.,"New York, NY",5,187,18
1.0,11/19/2010,"Ok..where should i start. First off i know the nightclub part of LAVO isnt easy to get into, so that's why i got on the guestlist. Me and my two girlfriends asked one of the guys at the door to check if my name was on the list and we had no problem. Then we came to realize that we must've spoke to the wrong guy because we were upstairs in the restaurant and they wouldntlet us go downstairs till we got our tickets, back outside. So we did just that. We went outside to speak to one of the door guys told him the situation and he handed us three tickets...BUT as we walked past the rope the BOUNCER, not the guys with the guestlist, said we got ""kicked out earlier"", wouldnt let my friend in and wouldnt even let us explain. Im sure that the bouncer did this because after we came back out to get the tickets, they wouldn't let my ""one friend"" in, like were going to leave her, and said only two of us can get in, meanwhile they were letting groups of 5 chicks in right infront of us. What does that tell you! Let me tell you this bouncer was a douchebagggg and a half. WOW...not only did he not let my friend in, but he had her by her wrist like she was a criminal. Frankly, it was an embrassing situation. This place is filled with stuck up people and unless you look rich or old, you have no chance of getting in. There were so many people saying fuck it, lets just go somewhere else. Not worth your time, trust me!! Christen at the door, your an asshole. Richard, you let the bouncer tell you what your job is and to the BOUNCER...if any of you decide to go there and end up with this guy, well goodluck.",5,1,1,Lauren H.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,3,1
3.0,11/16/2010,"If reviews were based on the scene alone this place would get 5 stars easily. I've been to the one in Vegas, which is pretty much the same as here. Good, but not great food. Loud, cramped, but alot of fun. If you're looking for a quiet night out, with 5 star food & service, this isn't the place. The food is actually pretty good depending on what you order. The salads were great, especially the beet salad. The tuna tartare was much better than I expected, and the pastas are mostly above average. The eggplant parm, however, was terrible IMO. Way too many thin layers, packed with too much cheese and breading. It looked like more like a giant piece of lasagna. Our waitress also told us it was pre-made, which brings me to my main issue with this place. It just has that ""prepackaged"" feel to it. The food is tasty, in the same way The Cheesecake Factory's food is tasty. As a matter of fact, this place reminds me of a fancy, Italian-themed, glitzy version of The Cheesecake Factory. One that just so happens to have an exclusive club attached to it. It all seems a little too commercial for NYC. The greatest places in the city are great because they don't try so hard. They don't have to. I had a great time, and would definitely go back. Although, with so many incredible restaurants in NYC, it's tough to give it more than 3 stars.",2,0,0,Mario F.,"Manhattan, NY",55,64,0

THe tuna tartare was INCREDIBLE.  The brancini was also delicious, a bit salty, but good.  I definitely would go back and would want to check out the weekend scene, especially with the lounge downstairs.",0,0,0,Dawn S.,"New York, NY",3,16,0
4.0,11/7/2010,"We stumbled upon this place after the marathon and I love it! It reminded me of a very small balthazar type bistro - at least the front/bar area. Mirrored walls, wood paneling, black and white tiled floors - you get the picture. We sat by the window so we could enjoy all of the foot traffic. I just viewed the photos and perhaps the main dining room has been renovated but I missed the disco ball and the velvet seating? I believe Lavo is due for some updated photos.Very fresh selection from the raw bar and yes- the bloody's were quite nice. The wine list had a nice offering as well. I ordered the polenta fries and the steamed asparagus ($10/each). As for the polenta fries - there were four to plate - almost the size of french toast sticks. They were lightly fried cornmeal sticks -served with marinara and freshly grated parm (not powdered -thank God). The steamed asparagus were cooked in olive oil, lemon and garlic. I really enjoyed it all - ambiance, food, drinks, vibe...",2,0,0,Camille M.,"Manhattan, NY",91,252,415

4.0,10/24/2010,"Bono was seated in the second banquette, which should pretty much say it all about this place. Look, you're not going to Lavo for the food. You're going because it's a fun party type place, with a crazy, over the top dinner scene.This place was packed. I mean packed. The initial bar was overflowing with a big money uptown crowd with some seriously fun people watching going on. Facelifts everywhere. The restaurant is behind the bar, the room is big with big tables. The aisles in the first half of the place are jam packed, too packed to even walk for a while. And people are eating amidst this madness. Our table was situated farther back and we ate in relative peace.Service in both the bar and restaurant were surprisingly good. My filet was steakhouse quality, priced at $47 with no sides. Not as good as I've had, but it was a serious piece of flesh. Many meals on the menu priced in the low-mid twenties, which surprised me.This isn't my type of place, but it certainly can deliver a big night out if you're looking for that. but the place was beautiful in a Pastis kind of way, the crowd was electric (if a bit unusual and plastic looking), and the night was fun.  Place was a total, absurd scene. DJ was good, played Beatles and other tunes. Not a crazy club style DJ - it was a pretty girl in a suit.  This was for Saturday night in October. Arrived 9:30 at its most packed. Did not sit down until 11pm. Will not go back but then again, I was dragged her from a friend. For those looking for this type of scene, it certainly delivers.

4.0,10/21/2010,"*********** Review 294 *************          Follow their sister in Las Vegas location, here the newest one right across the street from Tao. We came here after Tao for some more love. The place is swanky but more contemporary decor, dark wood, light tiles, & some red booths, than anything. They serve food & drink just like Lavo in Vegas, and the place turns to a lounge & club after dinner time.          Menu serves lot of pastas, brick over pizzas, raw bar, steak, & more Italian dishes like Veal Milanese,  Veal Parmagiano, Grilled Swordfish Giardiniera, Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato, all reasonable price to Manhattan standard.         Drinks menu is definitely less than Tao: 3 Ketel 1, 1 Patron Silver, 3 Fragoli, 1 Prosecco, 1 Hendricks, 1 Grey Goose for $140!

4.0,10/20/2010,"I walked into Lavo expecting to hate this place. The front bar was loud, stuffy, and packed with people who wanted absolutely nothing to do with me. I immediately formed the prejudiced opinion that I'd be subjected to over-priced, sub-par Italian at the sacrifice of being part of some ultra-exclusive scene. Well, it was a scene, all right. But as you can see from my rating, somehow Lavo won me over.Much to my surprise, it was the food that did me in. It also helped tremendously that I was there with one of the owners, who clearly knew what to order, and did so family-style for the table. Therefore, I didn't spend a dime, and after seeing the prices, am that much more thankful for the dinner invitation. Don't ask me how I get myself in these situations.Anyway, their specialty is certainly their Meatball, an enormous Kobe sphere topped with whipped fresh ricotta and served in a cast iron skillet designed for the table to share. It was downright delicious, perfectly, miraculously, and evenly cooked inside and out. Standard starters like garlic bread with marinara and calamari were well above-average. The Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil was far from noteworthy and the Bone-In Rib Eye was a little too well-done for my liking, but, at this point, my palate still tasted of that ridiculously outstanding meatball and I was in no position to complain in the least. I don't typically go crazy for dessert, but you'd be nuts not to give the Oreo Zeppole a try, paired with a wonderful malted vanilla milkshake.As for the aforementioned scene, well, you can expect twelve-tops of eleven models and one sugardaddy at the head of the table, rich twenty-somethings with clearly nothing else to do with their day except inject their faces with Botox and collagen, pushy and loaded old men cruisin' for fresh, young ass, and middle-aged divorcees in skin-tight leopard print dresses to showcase their new boobs. This is clearly not my usual crowd. But when I'm being wined and dined, hey, I'll run with whatever crew you want me to. As I confess this, I now come to the realization that if I was born female, there's about a sixty percent chance I'd be a dirty, dirty gold-digger. But I don't need expensive diamonds, hard drugs, or plastic surgery. I'll just take the meatballs. Seriously, worst gold-digger ever.",13,25,11,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",633,551,148

When you're trying to be the next hot thang in NYC, I won't expect much from the food/service.But I had such a great time here! People-watching while waiting for our food was a pure riot. Fellas, this is the place to be for eye-candy (and the wannabe eye-candy!) You see the 40-somethin' botoxed chicas competiting with the hot 20-somethin' - there's a flavor for everyone =).

2.0,9/22/2010,"Lavo is the quintessential ""hot new spot where everyone has to go,"" but really... it isn't anything special. If you want Italian food, you can get just as good and better Italian food at other places around the city. If you want ambiance, there are better spots around the city as well. This place gets its hype because it's affiliated with Tao and all of the Las Vegas predecessors. It's a good restaurant in the grand scheme of things, but it's not worth all the hype and all the price.I waited 50min to get seated and had to deal with maitre'd Christian at the door, who had zero people skills and really couldn't care less because I wasn't an A-List guest that they were expecting. He was rude and a bit obnoxious. I do have to admit that the cocktail waitresses and the other hostesses were very nice, but management is key at a new establishment. If you're putting this guy upfront to greet your guests, maybe management as a whole doesn't really get it.All in all, the food was good, the ambiance was good. However, I wouldn't recommend it.

People with shiny hair and incredible heels predominate, followed by people in Prada suits, followed by a lot of women carrying fashion-label bags the size of sofa cushions. In the minority: the unbeautiful. The garlic bread was warm, fresh, and tasty. The marinara which accompanies the bread rivals Scott Contant's tomato sauce.The Chicken Marsala and Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection. The chicken Marsala was not served with much of the wine sauce so I recommend asking for extra sauce on the side. The mashed potatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms were ordered as sides. The mashed potatoes had great texture and flavor. The broccoli lacked salt and mushrooms were spot on. The service was good for an opening weekend.
