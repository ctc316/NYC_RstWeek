3.0,4/14/2019,Came here for breakfast one day. Very good. Very overpriced. I do have to say - they have awesome green juice. But everything else is mediocre and overpriced for what it is. Cute ambiance and very nice service,0,0,0,Juliana G.,"Northport, NY",336,78,58
1.0,3/24/2019,"They were out of French toast by noon on Sunday!  What?!?  They didn't know they'd need bread?  With a very limited menu, can they really afford to drop one item?  No bread offered with the omelet either.   No Splenda, only bitter stevia packets.  Yuck.ONE TOILET FOR THE WHOLE RESTAURANT in a gender-non-specific bathroom and a sign suggesting using bathrooms on the second floor.  But I defy you to find the stairs or the bathrooms.  I felt like Alice through the looking glass in my search.  Which door?  There is no signage to lead the way so I guessed after getting vague directions.  In addition I stumbled down a stair and hurt my shoulder coming back because the edges are unmarked.  I ended up in an office suite on the third floor but never did find those bathrooms.  The waiter acknowledged they are aware of the problem.  SO FIX IT!  Save some money and go to a diner.  I promise they'll have bread for French toast.",0,0,0,M T.,"Astoria, NY",0,4,0

Service was very good (our coffees and waters were never empty) and food was tasty. I had the shrimp salad and it had a lot of interesting components that paired nicely together.

1.0,2/25/2019,"What a miserable evening. We arrived to celebrate my daughters birthday and asked the host when we arrived if we could have a cake delivered to the table. Both hosts at the desk said they would take care of it and include a candle.We ordered dinner. And then dessert. And then waited and waited. Finally, we asked for the check. As we walked out I told the host what a disappointing evening we had. What should have been fun and festive left us feeling deflated, saddened and angry. Aren't Saturday night birthday celebrations an easy way for a restaurant to make diners happy? I'm happy to pay for the piece of cake.

1.0,2/17/2019,"Ok, I will start by saying that I have had a FANTASTIC meal here. I am in NYC a few times a year for work. My colleague and I ate dinner at Jams in November and it was really a great experience. We had homemade pasta and charcuterie and cheese plates. The service was outstanding. We were so impressed and loved the decor that the next time we had to come into the city for work, we booked our stay at the 1 Hotel. While at the hotel, we booked a Sunday brunch at 10:00am, since that is when they claim Brunch Service begins on their website. We were told that brunch did not start until 10:30 so the regular breakfast for us...Ok, slightly disappointed, but the regular menu looked good as well. I ordered my breakfast and a side of toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. No special orders, just right off the menu. Less than ten minutes after we were there, the people next to us were served with Brunch Menus...it was 10:10am (not 10:30).Breakfast came out and it was the most Zen bagel EVER, (insert joke here) Everything is NOTHING, that's right folks, plain bagel with cream cheese (cheese was in a ramekin that had a cracked crust on top of it, looked a bit tired). The eggs I had were good. My colleague is a fast eater and finished well before me. This was a cue for the staff to continuously come over and try to take my plate of food from me while I still was eating. This happened four times while I was trying to finish my food. The waitress even put her hands on my plate and went to take it away while I still had a mouth full of food. While we were eating, we noticed the hostess (with very long straight hair) kept leaning over tables to adjust or add set ups, etc. and twice we saw her hair going into the empty water glasses that people then would be drinking out of. So, naturally I will not be back. The attitude and the hype are not warranted with such horrendous serviceIf you do go for brunch here, maybe ask for a fresh water glass before drinking from the one on your table.",0,0,1,Kathy T.,"Kittery Point, ME",11,69,1
1.0,2/16/2019,"Something is definitely off with the service at this place. We tried it twice as hotel guests. Both times it takes a committee of five to get a table when the restaurant is half empty. Nobody is any rush to serve the customer. They leave you standing around while they ""get the table ready"". It's a small place you can see every table is ready.  For breakfast I was told if you want an omelette you can only have their ""Jams Omelette"". The only customization I was allowed was egg whites. Evidently my request if an egg white omelette with tomato only was too overwhelming for the kitchen. Want cream with your coffee? They bring you buttermilk and look at you like you are nuts wanting cream.  Want to sub out blueberry in the pancakes instead of chocolate chips? They bring you pancakes with both chocolate chip and blueberry.  Really an utter disaster for breakfast.",1,0,0,Alex D.,"Dallas, TX",0,52,9
3.0,2/12/2019,"I had high hopes for Jams, but I guess, they might be better for lunch/dinner rather than breakfast.  The dishes we had were OK, but uninspired.  The everything bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon lacked the potent flavor one expects of an everything bagel and the absence of tomato as part of the dish (I know, I could have asked for one, but it seems natural that a bagel with lox, onions and capers would also have a thin slice of tomato), made the dish very bland and not much better than what I could have at a local bagel store for half the price.  The dishes that other people had were also just OK and they all came out very quickly for hot dishes which begs a question as to whether they were prepared fresh.The service also could be improved.  I had to wait and wave our waiter for a coffee refill-not once did he stop to check on us if we needed anything.This place seems very overhyped and overpriced.",0,0,0,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,698,0

2.0,1/31/2019,"Not quite my Jam. I found the portions small and over-priced. Also, this restaurant presents as healthy but we found the food quite oily, like the kind of oily that leaves a film on your mouth.

5.0,1/6/2019,"Jams was one my best dining experiences to date, ranging from the quality and taste of the food and drinks to the excellent service. We tried many different starters and entrees and they were all delicious using quality ingredients. The menu is rotated by month so it's going to change but the care taken to prepare the dishes is obvious. If they offer specialty drinks I would recommend trying it because it's usually based on some unique blend. In our case they made a drink with what they call a ""green juice"" (blend of vegetables and fruits) which was delicious. Finally the restaurant environment is unique offering several different types of spaces you can choose from: regular seating, intimate seating, family style table, high tops, bar, etc. the service was exceptional in terms of the patience and care with which the waiter guided us through the courses and even the care of the staff clearing the table. I highly recommend this restaurant, you won't be disappointed.",1,1,1,Zanku A.,"Glendale, CA",97,62,15
4.0,1/5/2019,"3.6 stars... everything is well made here and the service is on par. It is also a family friendly restaurant. The interior is rustic and has a two story volume with clerestory windows that makes it very comfortable to be in. I had the Jams omelette which is the signature dish here. Its exterior texture was super smooth like the Japanese tamago but the fillings were too little. It was the smallest omelette I had in my life, seriously. The portion is almost like a joke because the croissant we ordered at $4 was a mini croissant that should cost like $1 where I come from. So the value is lacking here for sure. Generously rounding up to 4 stars because they deserve it for the quality and the venue BUT I will likely skip this place next time around.",27,18,26,Albert H.,"Mount Hope, KS",1696,224,1195

My friend and I had made brunch reservations, but still ended up waiting about 15-20minutes for our table. The brunch menu was much smaller than expected, so options were limited. I ordered the egg omelette with a salad, which was very very underwhelming. For the prices listed, I was expecting quantity and quality, but we got neither. The omelette was very mediocre, and the ""salad"" was just some greens tossed on the plate with olive oil.

No frills or thrills, no seasonal specials and pretty much just a basic brunch.We both went for the poached eggs on avocado toast, though I had mine hard boiled. (I wanted soft but ""they don't do soft boiled"") On the side we did seasonal fruit, without the honey offered, bacon and sausage links.The highlight for me were the sausage links and seasonal fruit. The side salad that came with the poached eggs was too rough and under dressed. I think the english muffin on the bottom was flavored in some way because it just tasted odd and there wasn't much avocado.

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with the waffle fries. The chicken was good, fresh and crunchy. I can't say it was amazing but it was a good sandwich.

1.0,9/25/2018,I have gone here a few times and I thought the bar was a great place for a nite cap. However after tonight I will never go here again. I sat at the bar with a few friends.  I sat down and immediately the bar was leaking under the bar top nasty skunk water from the trap trays onto my pants. Yes the leaking tap liquid that smells like rotten vinegar was leaking on my pants. When I alerted the bar tender she said she would take care of it. After a few minutes of her just standing there I asked again which she replied I'll take care of it. Mean while the liquid is still leaking on the ground onto others and my pants still have it on them. She then instead of getting a towel proceeded to talk trash about me to the other bar tender who also did nothing. They were standing right in front of me like I didn't know what was going on. A colleague of mine too asked the bar tender which fell on deaf ears. I finally asked the other bar tender for a towel which he finally gave me one. I don't often write reviews but I felt this warranted a review. I WILL NEVER go to this restaurant again. I know this may not mean anything to this establishment but the bar tender was awful and disrespectful and felt other should know. There are too many great places in Manhattan to waste time at this place with disrespectful bar tenders. Full transparency at the end of when I got loud with the bar tender the manager came over and compt the two drinks. This was nice of the manager but the bar tender who is the true face of the establishments was disrespectful to the patrons. Go else where.,3,0,0,J G.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",2,5,0

2.0,8/29/2018,"I read the mixed reviews, and decided to give Jams a chance. The entire experience was underwhelming and I can't say I'd go back. First, I tried to make a reservation for Sunday brunch the night before. There were no openings online. I called in, the lady on the phone told me they were pretty booked, but could squeeze us in for 11:45am.We arrived for our Sunday brunch, and the place was pretty dead. Decor was nice, hostess and server were polite. I ordered the omelet and was very disappointed. It was really rubbery and was not something I would expect from any restaurant. I'm a terrible cook and my home omelets are a million times better. At one point, I plugged in my Apple watch into the outlet to charge at the table next to us. We were heading to the airport and I figured I'd make use of the empty outlet and empty table next to us.   A gentleman who I assumed was the manager came over and asked me to remove it because he had to seat someone at the table. I removed it as he asked. About 30 minutes later, we finished up our meal, and of course no one had been seated next to us. Not a big deal, but just seemed a little unnecessary since it was not bothering anyone and no one was ever seated at the table next to us. I would not recommend Jams for brunch.

The atmosphere is very nice, the opened space makes the restaurant feels very spacious. In terms of food, we thought most of everything we ordered were a bit on the salty side, especially the charcuterie. The kale salad and the jams chicken from the restaurant week menu are also salty. The lobster roll and the jams burger were actually way better than expected. The service was not bad, as they were mostly attentive. Though there were time when we couldn't tell if they were just leaving us alone or slacking as no one really came to check on us to see if we were okay after they took away our plates. We eventually had to ask for a dessert menu, but opted out as we were full. I was expecting that they would do a little something for birthday, but maybe I was asking too much.

Our server was polite and fairly helpful. Food came out quickly and in order.Food: The patters were all beautiful. Our party all got variations of the burrata and scrambled eggs. If only the taste matched the appearance. It was decent but not great. The burrata was a tad bland. The mushrooms were choice. The eggs okay, at least not cooked well done. Their pork sides were good. Others had some pastries that we could have taken or left. The appetizers were somewhat bland, too. Passable fare for the area but nothing to write home about.Drinks: I really liked my beet cocktail. Others enjoyed their boozy cocktails, too. The beer/wine was fair selection. Prices: What you'd expect for the area with entrees $12-20, cocktails $mid-teens. Overall, I wouldn't protest if friends wanted to come back.

Their cappuccino was a latte and had way too much milk and very little foam.  Also the smoothie comes in a very small juice glass for $8 - a rip-off. The apps and speciality cocktails were also very good.  The huckleberry smash, a bourbon drink, was amazing.  However they have limited choices in bourbon.  The ServiceThis service at the restaurant brings down my rating from a four to a two.  On service alone it's a minus 1.  While you get right in, it took up to 15 minuets before we got water and even longer to get coffee.  The wait staff was not friendly and rarely smiled.  They mixed up orders and required you to wait on yourself at the bar.  So if good food and bad, unfriendly service is your thing then this is a place for you.  However, we found other restaurants in the area to have better food and much better service.",1,0,0,Michael S.,"Woodinville, WA",21,7,0

As in each plate was more than double the size of what we could eat per person. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't necessarily bad or anything. But considering the pricing and the size of the portions it definitely wasn't great either. Not only that but the service was also nothing to be proud of. Not sure what happened but after our drink order our initial waitress disappeared for more than 15 minutes. We had to remind another waiter of our drink order and by the time our drinks finally made their way to our table we hadn't even ordered food yet.

There is just no denying how great this place looks. If you want to impress anyone, take them here. Food is pretty solid but there are some issues.... hence the odd 3 1/2 star average for such a cool spot. The Jams Chicken, at first taste comes across as an unbelievable wood smoked chicken. But it is thin and lacks a roundness of flavor. Good but not amazing. My pesto pasta was very ""garden-ey"" and healthy tasting. If you want something decadent, do not order this.

Went in on Sunday night around 6:30pm and it was not busy at all so we were seated immediately. However, the service was extremely slow!We sat down but the drink menu that they gave us was the wrong one- gave us dessert instead. I mean I love desserts and it was great to see the selection but we wanted to see what kind of drinks they offered. It took awhile for us to even get the attention of our waiter to swap out the menu...The waiter was nice enough to give an explanation on the drinks and even give us a tasting- because I couldn't decide on a wine. I ordered the butternut squash soup to start and maplebrook burrata for my main. My friend ordered the linguettine for dinner but no starter. What made it awkward was that the waiter decided upon himself and say well if you're not getting an appetizer, you can share the soup and I'll bring bread for the table. We are friends but soup isn't something that can be shared unless he split the bowl in two. The bowl came, (just one) and gave us two spoons. At this point since he mentioned it was for sharing, it would've been too awkward to say ""sorry this is my dinner and I don't want to share my soup"" so of course I offered it to her...It took a very long time for the main to come out- mine was a salad and hers was pasta. We literally thought they forgot about it because it took so long. I wasn't too happy about the salad, I think it was left out for awhile because the two breads that came with it as well as my salad was soggy...I don't think she enjoyed her pasta because she only ate half.When we tried to ask for the check, that took forever too!

Atmosphere was very nice, lots of pretty tourists, low key just chilling out, like you'd expect from a hotel/lobby restaurant. We sat at the bar & started with the crab dip which was actually pretty decent but it was all down hill from there. My burger was strong & greasy and every bite was just greasy tasting.....I felt like a greaseball for the rest of the day, truth be told. The Mrs' shrimp salad was just a hot mess-no flavor, weird mix of textures/produce, droopy greens and just bland & below average, not good. She barely ate any.

Nobody can deny workers the right to converse with one another while they are working, but does the waiter really need to tell the bartender that he's going to an vegetarian diet after seeing a documentary about food...as I'm eating the $26 chicken entree. Not self-aware about the optics of it all. The restaurant's saving grace is the vibe and decor, which is very nice. The manager did reach out to me, so I really appreciate that.

My friends got the gnocchi with sausage and broccoli rabe. I LOVED my pasta dish, and it was a great portion size. The gnocchi was also good, but I thought mine was better. The gnocchi was also a smaller portion, and I feel like I would've been hungry still if I had ordered that. The meals are pretty pricey (pastas are $26-28 and meat entrees are more.)

Also, having the same Chef that my fave restaurant in the city (Barbuto), I knew it wouldn't disappoint.Food: I had the roasted chicken salad ($21).

The warm complimentary bread to start the meal with olive oil (mmmm) and butter were also good.Overall, I totally recommend for a business lunch or weekday sit-down lunch.

There was so chilli oil on the top which caught us off guard and was so spicy that we were almost gagging. We did ask for some bread and that too so long that our main came before we got it. My colleague had the crab starter. Which was delicious and the only good thing we ate. I had the chicken plate which was huge! The chicken was prepared though so that the skin tasted like ham (which I am not a fan of) and the meat was undercooked and still bled. The Jam fries were nothing special either.

Despite the great ambiance, decor and pleasant staff here, the execution on all levels was barely acceptable.Cappuccino ordered with low fat milk came with whole milk.Baked eggs were the best tasting dish, but the cast iron plate was so crazy hot that a slight touch left a burn to the hand and over cooked the eggs in seconds. There was barely any asparagus in the dish (like two tiny pieces). Otherwise a pretty fresh and tasty dish.Eggs and bacon or ham... eggs were fine. Bacon was tough and ham was thin and dry. $18 for that? Or $28 if you add the coffee, fruit cup and juice. Ordered the ham, they brought bacon. Completely forgot the juice and the fruit cup. The toast was dry and flavorless. No jam in a place called Jams? The fruit cup boring and looked like it was prepared a day ago. The one saving grace was the juice. Not bad.The omelette... dry thin egg, scant bits of ham and ramps... so disappointing. Honestly, I've had better at a hotel buffet. Boo!The one other good thing was the green juice.The last bad thing is the included 18% tip. Our server although sweet did not check with us when the food was delivered with incorrect and missing items.

I didn't hear about this till later in the lunch. I went to the restroom and found the manager. I asked her if 'no substitutions' was a standard policy of theirs, and she said 'yes.'  We are from out of town, so we won't be coming back regardless, since we don't visit NYC regularly.

5.0,12/14/2016,"I really liked Jams. Not sure why it only has 3.5 stars. The service, ambiance, and food were all very good. As I said in my tip, the restaurant looks really cool inside and out. It's located on the floor level of a hotel and the outside is covered in green foliage. The interior is like industrial rustic, idk if that makes sense. It had a feeling of modern farmhouse. Our server was attentive and knew the menu inside and out. She made some awesome suggestions and we started with charcuterie, lamb sausage (it was ground sausage with some yogurt which was amazing) and the tuna poke. For the main I had the grilled shrimp salad because I wanted to keep it light. Ample shrimp and it paired well with all the starters we got. The dressing on the lettuce was also light and didn't overpower. This was a good place for a business lunch.

I was with work colleagues otherwise I would have asked a manager if the salad could be served without dressing (even Olive Garden is happy to serve their salad without dressing).  I was surprised at the inflexibility.  I had it because I still eat fish, and was punishingly salty as can be expected.    The only Veg choice on the menu was the risotto, which was tasty but not very healthful.   Two stars for good service and atmosphere and the tasty risotto but please add more veg friendly dishes.",0,1,0,Patty G.,"Kendall Park, NJ",14,109,0

5.0,10/9/2016,"I've been to Jams once before, for dinner. The roast chicken is something Jonathan Waxman is known for, a may clients of Barbuto can attest to. The flavor of the skin is slightly different at Jams, but nonetheless it is quite good and worth checking out. I went back recently for the sunday brunch which, as of this writing, is $35 pp + tip + drinks. It's served buffet style, and is quite a feast. The pastries include muffins, croissants, eclairs and a wide variety of other sweet offerings. There is a section of bagels, with an excellent scallion creamcheese, smoked salmon and all the toppings. In this same section you may find a variety of salads, grilled butternut squash, avocado toast, ricotta toast with fresh figs, quinoa, etc. In the next section you will find scrambled eggs, polenta, thick slices of bacon and excellent breakfast sausage. There are also french toast sticks here which were great. Next to this is the meat section. There was the classic Waxman roast chicken, and today there was a juicy, well prepared skirt steak. The available sauces included chimichurri and a fantastic harissa sauce. There were also roasted carrots and potatoes available. The final section is an omelet bar which makes some amazing omelets. The food is all farm to table, and very well prepared by Waxman and his crew. This could be the best kept brunch secret in NYC - for now. Service was great.

I truly cannot say enough good things about this place!! From the decor (which feels open and spacious with the tall ceilings and windows), to the food, all of the staff working up front, the servers, and the management everyone was very professional along with being happy and willing to answer any questions we had while there.  The times we were there were usually quite busy so to consistently receive this level of service and have multiple staff check on our table to ensure all was well is remarkable.  I know, it's NYC, the expectation is that ppl are not as friendly up here but that was absolutely not the case at Jams! We will always return here when we are in the area and I've already referred someone to come here while chatting with them at the grocery store yesterday!

Very light, airy and comfortable.  Food was flavorful and well prepared.  My wife had an omelette with wild mushrooms and squash that was amazing.  I am a pretty basic breakfast guy, but my eggs and bacon were perfect. Our server was very helpful and paid just the right amount of attention to us. Also, our food came out very quickly.  The restaurant was probably a little more than half full at 12:15 when we arrived. The two reasons I knocked off a star were since my wife and I were visiting NYC, I asked for a window seat.  All the windows were either 3 or 4 tops.  The host would not seat us there since there were only two of us. He then seated us at a 2 top behind a pole. :-(  I watched and the entire time we were eating there were at least two window tables available.  Also, plan your bathroom visit. There are only two single WCs for a restaurant that seats at least 70 if they are full. Both of us had to wait in a 2-3 person line.

5.0,7/31/2016,"This was my second lunch at Jams. It is a fantastic restaurant with a great vibe. The restaurant is bright and sunny during the day and has outdoor seating with ivy covered walls. In evening, it's a warm look. The rustic look carries over to their menu with a smokey chicken and buttery Chablis wine among the excellent choices. The pot du chocolait is truly unbelievable and addictive!I would give this restaurant five stars just based on the food, but I especially want to thank the manager, Jeffrey, for turning around what could have been a horrible situation this past Saturday. I ordered the seared tuna, which by the way is incredible, and even though there was no indication on the menu that any tree nuts were in that dish, I always inform the server to please tell the chef I have a tree nut allergy. The server said there was nothing to worry about; no nuts in that dish. Well, I dug into the delicious tuna and a surrounding sauce that had a carrot base.  The sauce was grainy. I figured it was carrot chunks, until I was crunching on what I clearly recognized as nuts. We call the waitress over, and not only does she say that they are hazelnuts but she flat out lies about having told the chef about my allergy. No sane NYC chef ignores an allergy, this I know, so I knew she was lying instantly. While I am downing Benedryl in hopes of not having to use my epi pen, Jeffrey, the manager, made sure I was ok, kept checking on us to ensure the symptoms weren't worsening, and comped our entire meal. He even sent over dessert. He explained their very serious process for anyone with allergies and how there is a place to note it for the kitchen and chef at the top of the order form, which she did not do. Fortunately, I didn't eat more than three forks full of the dish, and the Benedryl controlled the reaction to just itching, All turned out ok. The waitress was sent home for the day, which I felt very bad about, but I am sure she will treat allergies with the seriousness they deserve now.Jeffrey was the epitome of a professional, and the staff was also.  I will definable be returning with friends here.",2,1,1,Dina I.,"Beechhurst, NY",19,87,1

I thought it was kind of boring to order potatoes as a side...because I mean how good can potatoes really be? But wow! I can see why they named the potatoes after Johnathon Waxman, because they were perfectly crispy, buttery, just the right amount of salt and rosemary. The chicken was the best chicken either of us have ever tasted. It melted in our mouths. My gnocchi was also perfectly browned on each side and like little pillows of buttery goodness! Unfortunately, the bar started to flood after we got our tuna poke starter, so we had to move to a different table. But then the water flooded across the whole restaurant by the time we finished our main course. The staff were excellent though, we're here in New York on vacation so we really wanted to order dessert. Even with the entire restaurant flooding, they moved us to a cute little table outside so we could finish our meal with coffee and dessert. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and an olive oil cake with raspberry coulis. Yum! Our waiter was so nice and the service and food was so good, we hardly noticed the flood that shut the entire restaurant down. We were really surprised when they comped us the entire meal!  Overall, great food, great service, and next time we're in NYC, we're going to stay in the hotel attached to the restaurant.

4.0,3/20/2016,"This review is for a dinner back on Feb 13th. Just got around to finishing it. My party of 4 had a very nice experience at Jams last night. Both the service, drinks and food  party of 4 had 7pm reservations and got here well in advance on this frigid 8 degree Saturday night. We cozied up to the bar to get the night started right. My wife and I couldn't think of exactly what we wanted to drink, so we both gave the bartender a few parameters and told her to surprise us.  We were both pleasantly surprises. She nailed it with a custom vodka cucumber drink for the wife,  and a tequila creation that brought me a little closer to the islands.We were sat at a window table along 6th Avenue.  A hodgepodge of space heaters lined the entire stretch of windows behind the tables.  Not that big of a deal.Our waiter Joe came right over and greeted us. He started out friendly, and only got better.  Okay, lets get down to it...APPS: KALE SALAD-Wow, and I don't like kale. Perfectly dressed and flavorful. CALAMARI-Interesting, but not thrilling. JAMS PANCAKE- They brought it back for good reason. BETWEENERS: GNOCCHI- I thought it was great (crispy brussel spouts-NEVER liked them till NOW) until I tried the SQUID INK RIGATONI. Both were rich and delicious, but the rigatoni won by a nose (or two).ENTREES: Me, the winner with TILE FISH with a roasted sun dried tomato puree. Hard to describe just how good it was. Flavors I've never tasted before. The wife had the ROASTED CHICKEN that was fantastic (it's all about the salsa verde) The STEAK at the table I'd have to give a B-.  Nothing to write home about. The COD was very good as well.  Even with how good the food was, THE SERVICE WAS THE STAR.  Our waiter Joe came right over and greeted us. He started out friendly, and only got better.  He was personable and engaging.  He walked us through the menu making recommendations including classics and his personal favorites.  He described the preparation and ingredients of several dishes for us.  He seemed to know them back and forth.  I had read other reviews which panned the service.  I'd have to say, that there is a measurable improvements over some of the service reviews I read.  Our service (not just Joe) was without flaw.  A manager, Frank, came over and checked on us as it appeared he did with most tables.  In scanning the dining room, the staff looked buzzing and attentive.  I never saw them just ""hanging around"" waiting to drop the check.I'm looking forward to coming back when its a lot WARMER.",1,0,0,Tim S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",3,10,12

There are only two options on the entire lunch menu, a green salad or a pasta dish. I asked if I could have the caesar salad with balsamic or different dressing and was told ""No unfortunately the chef will not allow substitutions for that dish"" So I asked so the only option on the menu is a green salad? and he said yes but you can add avocado..I was puzzled both by the inflexibility and also that the hotel concept was to have sustainability as a core concept yet few plant based options?

1.0,1/4/2016,"Went here for lunch today and was very disappointed. First the hostess spent several minutes looking at a screen to seat us in the half empty restaurant. She seated us and then moved us a minute later to a ""more comfortable table"" which was actually closer to kitchen and louder. She also forgot a second menu and we had to wait several minutes for a second one. Second both bathrooms in the place seem to be locked and for staff only. A bartender and a server tried to tell me otherwise but were unable to unlock then and a sign on the door told me to go upstairs. How do they not know where the bathrooms are? Third the food was very pricey for what it was. I ordered risotto and it was a pretty small serving for $22. When the bill came they put it down as $28! They did fix it but how many people have they ripped off with that?? Fourth they must be over staffed and poorly trained. The staff were standing in clumps gossiping and pacing. So unprofessional.

At these prices and at this location there are much better choices for lunch and dinner. No matter how good the food, bad service is annoying and can ruin the whole experience.  This place is not well-managed. The food was good but lacked attention to detail. Our order was a long wait and arrived lukewarm, had obviously been sitting somewhere for awhile.  Our waiter recommended a side of French fries (she said ""they are just like the ones at 'FiveGuys'"").  The fries at Five Guys do not cost $10 and arrive limp, soggy and cooled-off.  This is a place for tourists and conventioneers.

I had never reordered unless food was uncooked but we needed to do. All of the food was too salty and bland. (Tuna Tarutaru, our first dish - We thought way too salty but we thought only this dish and we were hungry so we ate. I think the tuna had been soaked in soy source for hours.) All food we ordered was disappointing. The waiter and floor manager were nice but everything was disconnected. I won't write anymore.

3.0,11/29/2015,"IN SHORT: A culinary legend from the '80s is brought back to life in Midtown Manhattan.THE STORY: It is a rare film whose remake decades later is touted as better than the original. In a revival, the paradigms set by the original film somehow feel compromised, anachronistic, or just banal and no longer relevant. Rarely does a remake win an Oscar.The same can often be said of a restaurant, particularly a restaurant like Jams, whose original style of California cuisine made waves in the restaurant culture of New York, but whose intellectual direction today is much less clear. Yet like many of these contemporary movies, Jams is still a restaurant worth experiencing, if not for insights into the culinary canon, then for tremendously well prepared food with a mild spark of freshness and creativity.The origin of ""California cuisine"" and its then-novel idea of using all-natural, locally grown ingredients to establish a regional style of cooking rooted in abundant seafood, lightly cooked vegetables, and lots of herbs is usually traced back to the 1970s with Alice Waters and her Berkeley restaurant, Chez Panisse. But after cooking in her kitchen and in Michael's Restaurant in Santa Monica, Jonathan Waxman gets the credit for bringing this style of cooking with French techniques and Californian ingredients to New York in 1984 with the original Jams.Despite its popular success and its bounty of light proteins, citrus, and fresh cilantro that drew New Yorkers eagerly away from the steakhouse, economic forces compelled Jams to shutter by the end of the '80s. Over 25 years later, the restaurant that now sits in the 1 Hotel Central Park on 58th Street and 6th Avenue is not so much a shot-for-shot remake of a once influential pioneer of cuisine, but rather a contemporary, New American restaurant with quiet nods to Waxman's Western culinary roots.Much like the decor in the hotel rooms upstairs, the spacious dining room at Jams is airy and full of light, neutral colors and natural woods, with an occasional pop of green, crawling ivy. Large windows that stretch to the floor give the space a high-end, yet industrial loft-like feel. At night, the sense is that Jams could easily be sitting on the side streets of San Francisco or Downtown LA.Occasional misfires on the menu threaten to shake the California dream of this restaurant, however. While the Roasted Mushroom Salad is full of delightfully earthy notes coming from the pine nuts, parmesan, and bitter greens, the muscatel vinaigrette is applied too liberally, and slimes up the mushrooms in a thick, oily dressing. The Maplebrook Burrata is a more balanced first bite, with subtle pepper flavors from the watercress and sweeter, nuttier flavors from the pistachio on top.Seared, just barely cripsy Gnocchi is served with lots of shaved brussels sprouts, pecorino, and a massive dose of walnut sage pesto in what would have been a heavy-handed stylistic faux pas if it weren't so good. The sage is an addictive complement to the bitterness of the sprouts, and all balance the perfectly prepared potato pillows of gnocchi, which was served at the end of summer with corn, lobster, and cherry tomatoes. It's a dish that only improves as it evolves.Proteins like the Jams Chicken and NY Steak are both charred on the outside and juicy on the inside, dressed with the lightest of sauces. The chimichurri sauce coating the steak is more successful than the simple tarragon butter melting over the restaurant's signature chicken dish, but they are likely the best two entrees on the menu.Yet the film is still in post-production, it would seem. The restaurant opened in August of this year, so it may be helpful to think of it as a work in progress to forgive several blunders in service that can occur throughout the course of a single meal. At one point while ordering recently, my friend looked up from her menu at our waiter and asked if he could possibly replace the beets in a salad with tomatoes or something else. He just stared beyond our table, impatient and unsympathetic, and mumbled simply, ""Tomatoes aren't in season.""That's not what she asked, but, well, okay. Thanks for reminding us that despite all of Jams' talk about low-fat sauces and fresh, colorful ingredients plucked in their prime, we are still in Midtown Manhattan, 3000 miles away from west coast hospitality, 3000 miles away from California.Yet I suppose that's what happens when a remake is so far removed from its original. Some significant details are lost, replaced with sanitized versions of themselves. In the end, The Great Gatsby was a good movie, but it wasn't a Best Picture. The new Jams is a good restaurant, even if it isn't an inspired one.",5,3,3,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245
5.0,11/29/2015,"The restaurant was such a treat! My friend took us here for a little after nuptial celebration. I had never seen it before and I work right near here so I knew it was new. To our surprise, our dear friend who was bringing us also had her friend, who works as the conceirge to the hotel with us for his birthday celebration. This place is amazing. Let me give you a little of the backstory as we were lucky enough to have Jorge explaining it all to us, as we ate: Eleven fun facts about JAMs and 1 Hotel:1) The ivy outside is grown in individual pots and watered daily such that it will live year-round;2) The tables inside the restaurant are made from recycled wood from Hurricane Katrina;3) The glasses in the suites are made from 100 percent recycled wine bottles;4) The floors of the 2nd story conference rooms are made from recycled basketball courts in Harlem;5) The doors of the main hotel (1 Hotel) are made from stumps and the majority of the hotel itself is both self-sustaining and environmentally friendly;6) The food selection only uses materials from 100 miles away so that they can meet the level of freshness the chef requires;7)  As such the food alternates nightly however there are some things always on the menu, such as the Jam's pancakes (which is a MUST HAVE when here);8) The chef and staff are amazingly friendly and treat you incredibly well;9) The grill used for the chicken alone was imported from Spain in order to maintain the taste it gives the chicken and was broken apart and delivered brick by brick;10) The pasta is all freshly made and perfect;11) When they were building the restaurant they had a wall of herbs for the neighborhood to use as needed.I have not had a meal like this in a long time, and the more I listened to the history of the restaurant and hotel the more I was hooked.

2.0,11/19/2015,"We were really looking forward to this 80s Jonathan Waxman revival. There's not much to the ambiance, lots of natural light and simplistic decor. The hotel lobby feels like you are hanging out in someone's living room at a contemporary beach house in the Pacific NW. The service was good, they were friendly and generally on top of things. The manager was very involved checking on tables and on the floor available to guests. He was a bit too casually dressed for a NYC midtown restaurant of this caliber, but really trying to please. On to the food. Our starters took quite some time and we were not served any bread. So we were very hungry by the time the dishes came out. We had one disappointing dish after another. Their signature caviar pancakes were bland and the salmon was off. They brought us a new dish which was a little better, but not a palate pleaser. The steak was very chewy and flavorless and could not be eaten. I don't think they even seasoned it. The cod was over cooked, the sear was burnt and it was way over salted. The leeks were over cooked and tasted burnt, the dish itself was lacking flavor and tasted fishy. The food itself did not taste fresh and seemed as though it wasn't thawed properly and/or had a bit of freezer burn. The sides were ok, cauliflower had a weird taste (that is generally my favorite, but I couldn't eat it) and the delicata squash was ok, not much flavor and a bit crispy. For dessert we ordered the German chocolate cake and the apple Napoleon. They were edible, but not memorable. We ordered coffee and tea. Coffee was ok, tea came in a nice sized pot. I had the Moroccan mint, which was very bitter and very dark like a black tea. There was no taste or aroma reminiscent of mint. I asked the server if it could have been something else and she kindly ensured me she had made it herself and their mint was a bit different from the norm. Well, it was certainly not an herbal tea, as I'm still wide awake and frustrated that I've been unable to sleep all night.Overall, the food was not a palate pleaser. The meal was not memorable and truthfully quite disappointing. The standout dish was the  kale salad, but that doesn't mean much, it would be just ok at another restaurant.

Our reservation was on the later side at 9:30pm so by the time we arrived (closer to 9:40ish), the restaurant was maybe 60% full. So we had no issues with noise. The food was really good. We started with the calamari which was grilled and accompanied by a thick toasted piece of bread. The sauce had a nice kick to it. We also started with the squid ink rigatoni with crab. Very tasty as well. We then split the chicken, the sea bass and a side of the corn. The chicken was very tender and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend commented that the chicken doesn't come with any accompaniments. However, it is half a chicken so quite a bit of meat. The sea bass was tender and prepared well, maybe a tad too much salt but that seems to happen at any restaurant these days. The corn was delicious and done in a mexican style with creme fraiche, cheese, etc. We topped it off with a great chablis recommended by the sommelier. A few suggested areas of improvement: service. We arrived around 9:42 for our 9:30pm reservation. We waited a few minutes to see the host because there were 2 groups in front of us. By the time we got up to the host (lets say 9:45pm), the host immediately said ""oh, good thing you are here, we almost gave your table away."" We looked around at a half full restaurant and were like, okay? Just wasn't a super pleasant greeting and we felt like we were being admonished. Had the restaurant been packed, then maybe we would have understood more but just seemed unnecessary. Throughout the night there were little kinks. Our appetizers arrived before our wine did. We never received any bread. We had to flag down someone to get wine poured from our bottle a few times.

Apps came, all 4 at the same time and we were out of crowded table space, had to remove the candle and a few glasses to fit everything. No apology or offer to bring 2 back later while he struggled with a runner to make it all fit. We had the kale salad, shaved vegetable salad, fluke crudo and burrata. We really enjoyed the apps we ordered. Would rate the apps on their own 5 stars for taste, freshness and presentation. For dinner we ordered 4 main courses and 2 sides. We ordered the duck, swordfish, rigatoni and gnocchi. The duck and the rigatoni would be worth getting again, but neither pasta was served at the proper temperature. The food was room temperature at best. We had the side of corn which was really delicious, and the fries which were overcooked and inedible. We asked someone to grab the waiter so we could let them know the fries were overdone. A manager came over and offered us fresh ones, we declined and she offered to take them off the bill. When the bill came the fries were still on the check. So now we had to wait, get the server to take the $10 fries off and get a new check. He did not even apologize for the inconvenience or take anything else off. It wasn't the money at all- it was the point if you say you'll take it off, take it off.  That just decreases the level of our overall experience. For dessert they did not have the pistachio cake on the menu that I had seen on yelp and been dying to try, and they were sold out for the night of the other dessert we wanted (baked Alaska). We settled for chocolate bread pudding and an apple turnover. Decent but wouldn't order either one again. If you want amazing dessert and are celebrating an occasion head down to LAVO two just two blocks east and try their 20 layer chocolate peanut butter cake, now that's a dessert!",2,1,1,Jensen J.,"Bayside, NY",1,23,23
2.0,10/7/2015,"Bland and forgettable. Had the tuno crudo, roast chicken and rigatoni. Pasta was microwaved, chicken was bland tuno was ok but boring. Service was good and attentive but no amount of niceties can make up for bad food. Avoid.",0,0,0,Richard E.,"Miami, FL",0,22,0
5.0,9/27/2015,Jams is jammin' food wise. Breakfast review only. Jams is on the first floor of a hotel off Central Park- an open corner space. Comphy tables in a beige colored background. Hotel breakfasts in NY these days serve some of the best NY breakfasts and Jams is top of the pops.Some of the usual breakfast faves are on board plus regional stars and housemade pastries with a farm to table sensibility.Ordered:Toby's Estate coffeeThe CalifornianChocolate croissant The ingredients of the food tasted super fresh and flavorful- warned tortillas with perfectly cooked eggs a chile and the tastiest pico and guacamole paired with the coffee and croissant was a killer California style breakfast right here in Manhattan.,6,2,2,Franny A.,"New York, NY",865,1323,1125
3.0,9/22/2015,"JAMS is perhaps one of the most beautifully designed restaurants in the city, along with its close proximity to Central Park. Of course with such a nice location, prices don't look too nice for the wallet. With the long awaited opening of the restaurant, I had expected more for the price and the background of such an establishment. However, I was left slightly disappointed by its food offerings and service especially when we first arrived at the restaurant and had to spend quite a long time at the bar when the restaurant wasn't visibly busy. The hosts were also not particularly friendly. The food was tasty, but nowhere near remarkable as I had hoped for or had anticipated with the overall ambience of the restaurant. There were some items on the menu that didn't appeal to me at all, but I was ready to order since I had searched for the menu online prior to my visit. I had also hoped my server would've paid more attention to our table, but he was preoccupied with other tables far away from our dining area, which was understandably difficult for him to notice the details. I seriously would like to visit this restaurant again to bring friends and family if there are improvements to the aforementioned problems given the ambience and its proximity to tourist attractions for those traveling from out-of-town.",6,1,1,Cecilia L.,"New York, NY",36,17,4
1.0,9/19/2015,"Extremely disappointed. We live in the area and we're excited for the new restaurant but instead our night was full of reordering and still being disappointed. I am allergic to nuts and my salad came with nuts when I asked for non. The hamburger was not at all up to nyc standards. If I'm going to live next to Burger Joint they better make hamburgers that are comparable. The waiters were nice but seemed scared of the chef because everytime I asked them for something they said ""let me ask the chef"" as if he was bullying them around. As for the kale salad. They wouldn't make it with the dressing on the side because it looses the ""integrity"" of the dish. Well what that really means is it is pre made in the back, we all know that. So thanks but no thanks. Jams for my sister's birthday was the worst idea",1,0,1,Victoria C.,"New York, NY",35,21,6
3.0,9/8/2015,"The restaurant is beautifully designed - Wooden, warm, and inviting. The staff were all very attentive and friendly.The cocktails were strong and not very tasty. We started off with the Spiced Nuts, which were yummy but a quarter cup of nuts for $7 is a little silly. The Jams Pancakes were next. They were good. Pancakes on top of a succotash and topped with smoked salmon and caviar. I was a little disappointed at the portion size.The Squid Ink Rigatoni was by far the winner and definitely why I'm giving JAMS stars. It was so delicious, served with chunks of king crab. We finished our meal with the Chocolate Tart dessert. Very sweet and the macadamia nuts gave it a nice crunchy touch.",5,3,2,Lindsey S.,"New York, NY",354,276,199

3.0,9/3/2015,"After a long awaited opening for a pair of Barbuto fans, we finally got to have dinner at Jams. Food 7/10Service 7/10Ambiance 8/10The pancakes were tasty and so unique. I would order those again. After reading reviews that the roast chicken wasn't as good as Barbuto's, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was very tasty and perfectly cooked. I would give the chicken 4 stars.The mushroom risotto was pretty good but I feel that I could have made better at home.Overall the service was good but we seemed to lose our server towards the end and it took a long time to get our check and pay - always a low point to end a meal on. We'll be back and I have a feeling it will only get better. Good luck Jams team, I hope you get better with age!",3,1,0,Martin H.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",1,42,3
4.0,9/1/2015,"JAMS made me think two things: 1) I wish I lived in NYC in the 80s to try all the wacky stuff they used to serve back then. And 2) I am really going to miss Barbuto.Well, the place is pretty cool. It was full of beautiful people doing their thing the night I was here, the dining room was somehow impressive and intimate at once, and Martha Stewart was seriously sitting two tables away from me. So, I get it. It's cool.But honestly the food was like a 3.5, except for two items that were pretty excellent. The shaved vegetable plate's dressing was exceptionally uninspired--just oil, vinegar and pepper--but I guess it is like ironicly rustic in a Jonathan Waxman kind of way. The JAMS Chicken was also pretty good but not quite as tasty as the one with salsa verde that they serve at Barbuto. Man, is it going to suck when that place closes.However, the JAMS Pancakes are absolutely great. They are just tiny reddish pancakes with caviar and smoked salmon atop them, and they are so ridiculously 80s but also so delicious. The Baked Alaska is the only other super tasty thing I tried. Like Mike C. said, it probably isn't the best one in the city, but in my opinion it totally saved and otherwise so-so meal.I also have to say that the service here is absolutely excellent. That is one of the primary reasons I am giving 4 rather than 3 stars. The host and hostess here worked hard to try to sneak me into a bar table and my waiter who might have also been a manager was exceptionally awesome. TLDR: If you are going on a date and want to show off or need to be in the scene right now def do go. Don't expect Barbuto-level food, but do get pancakes & baked alaska.",5,1,2,Paul A.,"New York, NY",270,403,462
4.0,8/26/2015,"New restaurant, with an excellent bar and great food!  Bar is great but very pricey, perhaps not by Midtown Manhattan standards, but enough that if I hadn't scored a killer deal at the new 1 Hotel in which it is ensconced I would probably drink at one of the better bars in the area for about half that price, unless they brought in live music as a value add that gave me a reason to want to spend a few bucks more. Love the Jazz though.  Drops one star for the breakfast service, which seems to be an afterthought of the chef to placate the hotel. Even though the quality of the food is A+ in the AM, the presentation, crammed into the corner of the bar with things kind of perfunctorily plated and an unintentional minimalism do not inspire one to fork over the lofty price. Likewise the AM staff bucks the rest of the hotel which is almost Disney friendly with the standard semi-surly NYC wait-staff thing (Not, I might add, a problem in the evening, where they seem to be more enthusiastic because the tips will be monster at those prices.).  Definitely worth a try.  It's been open two days so I'm sure they will work out the growing pains.",5,2,3,Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",1275,1528,5923
2.0,8/24/2015,"I met my friend out for dinner here tonight.  She got a cocktail at the bar before I got there.  When our table was ready, she closed out her tab at the bar.  When we got to our table, we realized that the restaurant charged her a 4 dollar service fee and a 2 dollar gratuity on a $14 dollar drink.  The fees almost equal half the price of the drink!  When we spoke to our waiter later about this, he advised us that sometimes the computer systems switch over to in room service (JAMS is part of a hotel) which automatically charges you a service fee and gratuity.  While acknowledging the restaurant's error, nothing was done to fix it.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time this happened tonight.We ordered the fluke crudo, gnocchi with lobster and seasonal vegetables, and the chicken (which Jonathan Waxman is known for from Barbuto).  First, after waiting an hour for our food, our fluke crudo never arrives.  Turns out our waiter forgot to put it in the system.  While he was very nice and apologetic, nothing was done to correct his error.  Second, when we got the gnocchi, I was disappointed to see that there was plenty of gnocchi but barely any lobster.  If you're paying for a $25 lobster gnocchi dish, you should at least get more than one bite of lobster.  Disappointing.  Third, we got our chicken with a side of heirloom tomatoes.  Chicken was okay; nothing memorable.  Same with the heirloom tomatoes.  We decided to treat ourselves to a baked Alaska and chocolate tart for dessert.  I did like the Baked Alaska but wish they set it in flames in front of you.  Chocolate tart was good but nothing special.Overall, with the wait time, quality and price of food, and the service errors, I will NOT be coming back.  The space was lovely though...",3,0,0,Melissa Y.,"Manhattan, NY",9,18,7
5.0,8/23/2015,"Good stuff. Started with cocktails. It was nice to see an Aviation on the menu. The Sazerac was also very good. We split the shaved vegetables to start. I had the duck, lady had the lobster pasta. Both were fantastic. We then split the flan and blueberry/ricotta dealy to finish. Both were just wow. And!  Waxman was in the kitchen personally checking every plate that went out. Only knock was that the water server came over to our table.  Often. Like 4 or 5 times during the meal. Also, it took a bit of time to get the check. These are not real knocks and I'm sure they'll work out the kinks as time goes on. Aces. We will return.",4,0,1,Jeff M.,"Manhattan, NY",106,314,36
4.0,8/21/2015,"I wasn't around for the original Jams, but I was glad to try the new version tonight at the 1 Hotel near Central Park.As expected, the food was all delicious. Unfortunately, as you would also expect from a hotel restaurant near Central Park, the prices were all on the very high end.It is a very nice, bright space, with floor to ceiling walls and a similar feel to most restaurants of this type opening these days. The service was ok, but you could definitely feel that they are still getting their bearings. On to the food:- Kale Salad ($14)Better than your average throwaway salad, this was a tasty and refreshing way to start the meal (note: no bread though to start the meal unfortunately).- Pizzette ($17)This was a pretty good little pizza to start, topped with pesto, goat cheese, burrata and cherry tomatoes. All of that stuff made for a bit of a mushy texture overall, but the bread itself was great.- Jams Pancakes ($25)As alluded to with the preceding ""Jams"" in the name, this is one of the dishes made famous at the original location. By far the most expensive non-entree, this consists of three tiny pancakes topped with red pepper, smoked salmon, corn sauce, creme fraiche and caviar. It's obvious from the ingredients why this one is on the pricey side. Nevertheless, it's also delicious and definitely a must try.- Short Rib Tacos ($19)Moving back up to the top of the menu in what must be a horrible typo, the tacos and the burger are listed under ""Bar Snacks"" alongside little bites like nuts and olives. Based on the size of this dish, it could practically be considered a bar snack, but the price totally disqualifies it from that section. This dish consists of two pretty small tacos that are pretty good, but not $10 a piece good.- Jams Burger ($21)Also not a bar snack, but the burger was closer to being worth the price, as it was a large size and very satisfying. It's a cheffy burger, but with the standard ingredients of bacon, lettuce, tomato and cheddar. The patty is great, and it comes with a small serving of the JW Fries (just in case you weren't sure who cooked them), which is enough to go with your burger, so make sure not to order the side of fries for $10 unless you really want a ton of fries.- Jams Chicken ($25)I never order chicken unless it's fried, but like he's known for at Barbuto, apparently Jonathan Waxman is a master of chicken, so we went ahead and tried it. It wasn't particularly memorable though, so I would probably go with a different entree.- Baked Alaska ($12)This was ok, but very far down the list of the great baked alaskas available throughout the city. It's also really small for a pricey dessert.- Pistachio Layer Cake with Blackberry Jam & Mascarpone ($8)This was actually quite good, but surprisingly lacking in presentation. At a place of this caliber, I was expecting to be wowed by a nice tall slice of layer cake, but this slice looked pretty thin and sad. Perhaps my expectations were skewed by a recent visit to Untitled and the incredible slice of cake they serve there.This is a really nice restaurant and possibly a good place to take your parents or guests from out of town to impress them and then show them some touristy stuff nearby at the Plaza or Central Park. Some of the dishes are definitely worth a try, but make sure you don't mind dropping a good amount of money on your meal.",23,13,19,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
