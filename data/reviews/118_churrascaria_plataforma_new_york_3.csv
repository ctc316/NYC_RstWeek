1.0,4/27/2019,"I like Brazilian bbq. Been to a fair amount of places. This one doesn't match up. Meat quality was just okay. Meats rarely came. Heard the guy at the table next to us ask ""Did you run out of meat?!?"" Quality sub par. Only thing premium was the price.",0,0,0,VJ A.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,0
4.0,4/26/2019,"This was a pretty typical brazilian steak experience. Came here with some friends to celebrate a friends new job and we had a great time just trying all of the steaks, pork, and lamb. Overall it is what i expected, though it lacked a very tiny amount in what I really cannot find the words for. Nothing was bad at all, but ALMOST as good as other places I have been to outside of NYC. Just not quite there. Still a big recommend, the value and fun of it is well worth it.",0,0,0,Zev L.,"New York, NY",190,174,50

3.0,4/7/2019,"I always chose this steakhouse over every other steak house. Until the other day when my family and I went there. My son found a HUGE hair in his food. So I brought it to the waiters attention. He called the manager and everyone apologized. Which is fine. Until the manager said ""he's going to take care of us"", which meant he's giving us a fancy bottle of water and then giving us the bill and charging us for it?? Ya, no thanks.

The never ending amount of meat they had coming around was amazing. All of it was soo delicious. The green side up was for them to keep on coming. The red side was for them to stop.

5.0,3/30/2019,As usual plataforma never disappoints. We sat down the stairs (which I didn't know existed). Salad bar was great- had a carpaccio that was amazing. The cheese bread they serve at meal beginning is to die for and the fried bananas are super good! All the meats were so good and the staff is always so accommodating - make a point to send people over your way if you want something specific.

(Don't judge, I love food and all kinds of it) Service was great! Everyone was on top of it as far as serving your meats, refilling your water, getting your specific meat requests, drinks being served, etc. Oh and their salad bar, also delicious!

It was a lot of fun and there was a lot of food to go around for everybody. There is something for every type of meat lover in the room! We tried so many types of steak, sausages, chicken and more. They take requests on how your steak will be cooked so that everyone is happy. While you wait for the meat to start coming around there is also a salad bar section that has some side dishes and potatoes. However you can also order whatever sides you want, and it is all unlimited! They have very tempting looking desserts and cocktails that I have had in the past though not recently. You will definitely leave very full and satisfied after this kind of great meal and experience.",0,0,0,Corinne B.,"Hoboken, NJ",341,151,248
4.0,3/10/2019,Classic Rodizio restarant. I use to come here years ago and I just say they do a great buffet. The salad bar options are always on point. Came here before a broadway show and it was the perfect dinner. Amazing service as usual and the meat was drool worthy. My only recommendation would be a little more flavor to the meat but if you like a fresher taste then this place is great. The bartenders and waiters were always on top of things and treated us with the best service. Will definitely be back here on a night when they have the live band because I'm sure it would be terrific.,0,0,1,Delores S.,"New York, NY",110,52,126
1.0,3/8/2019,"Horrible service starting with the awful manager! The manager should really work at a street food truck.I have been to so many Brazilian steakhouses so I know how great service should be but they are terrible! We went for lunch during our visit to NYC, the restaurant is less than half full and the manager was seating us next to the server's stocking station where they will bump into us. I asked to sit somewhere else, the manager wasn't happy about that and murmured in Spanish!!! Then after seating us, he took away the extra silverware, including my 4 year old son's set!! I told him that and he said I'm taking away the kid's silverware set!! They don't get u plates for the meat, my husband had to get one from the salad bar! They don't take away your empty salad plates, they don't refill your water. The meat servers don't know the difference between well done and medium ( asked for medium and gave me well done !!)The food is okay but horrible service!",0,0,0,Sandra N.,"San Antonio, TX",117,17,6
5.0,2/24/2019,"This place was amazing! First off I love the decor of the place. The salad and sushi bar was amazing, I have recently found a love for sushi and this bar just increased that love.

The good is amazing but the staff is really why I love this place.  They are attentive without being annoying and just adds to the ambiance of this beautiful restaurant. Ok now let's talk food! In my opinion this is one of the top 3 steakhouse or places for steak in NYC and what adds to the appeal is that it's not just limited to the finest all you can eat cuts , the salad and hot food bar is sure to keep you busy in between sampling sizzling off the skewer melt in your mouth broad meat selection offered here.

3.0,2/14/2019,I came here during restaurant week but ended up ordering from their actual menu since a lot of steaks were not offered as part of their restaurant week menu. My only complaint was the staff. I noticed that they were very attentive to the tables around us and barely came to our table to pick up our plates. We weren't even offered desserts to end our meal. I don't like to flag down waiters and busyboys but we had to do that a couple of times which is not what I expect to do here.,0,0,0,Angel J.,"Brooklyn, NY",412,128,123

4.0,2/9/2019,"We went during restaurant week and were so very impressed by this place! We were seated right away even though some people waited when we walked in but we had a reservation on open table. As soon as we sat, we were offered GF bread (pao de quijo) made from tapioca flour and cheese and a little warm. I've had better but it was great still. Since I have a Gluten allergy, they were personally accommodating and pointed me to what not to eat. The buffet wasn't labeled with anything so that was kind of annoying but you could probably guess what everything is. Still, they need to at least label their dressing!The meats were excellent and came around often. We had to slow them down by flipping the chip to red. My favorites were the top rounds, rib eye steaks, the pork sausage and the prime rib. My less favorite were the ham with pineapple sauce that was served from a moving carving station. It was a bit dry.. The desserts were gluten free and excellent! I'm a little biased though since I never get to try any. The passion fruit mousse was the best. I highly recommend. Definitely coming back here!",2,0,2,Christina R.,"Paramus, NJ",366,181,394
4.0,2/7/2019,"I came here for restaurant week and was blown away by what a deal it was! For what it normally costs(around $70) I probably wouldn't come here but even though it was restaurant week it was still truly ""all you can eat."" The meat kept coming faster than you can even imagine; at one point I must have had 10 cuts on my plate. I couldn't even tell you what they all were because it was happening so fast. Even the buffet had great options; a few different sushi rolls, scalloped potatoes, shrimp, salad, anything you wanted! What did catch me off guard though were the wine prices. We all ordered just house Chianti and it was $15, so that's how they get their restaurant week money back. All in all it was a good experience, the people were very nice and the food was good!",1,0,0,Caitlin D.,"New York, NY",170,106,108
4.0,2/2/2019,Probably the best Brazilian steak house in the city with a great selections of meats. Salad Bar isn't as varied at lunch as it is at dinner. Meat is always flowing but the wait staff are usually difficult to flag down to order drinks.,0,0,0,Henry A.,"New York, NY",95,8,0
5.0,2/1/2019,"Similar to other Brazilian steakhouses...very delicious! We were seated promptly. It's very spacious inside so plenty of room for all. We went on a Wednesday and it was crowded at all. I loved the caipirinha cart that goes around and lets you make your own caipirinha with different fruit flavors. Salad bar consists of the usual different salads, veggies, cheeses, meats, rice, and beans. What I noticed different here is that they also have fish and sushi which I liked.Once we hit the green light for food, it came out fast and often. Wide array of meats including pork, chicken, steaks, lamb, and sausages. Everything was very fresh and yummy. They have a dessert cart that goes around too. I had the chocolate cake which was good but I tried the cheesecake and it was amazing!You will leave very full and satisfied!",1,0,0,Yasmin A.,"New York, NY",234,215,450

4.0,1/29/2019,"Came here on Restaurant Week with a few friends. It was really packed, but the restaurant is spacious enough to accommodate a lot of people. Although we had reservations, we still had to wait a bit until our table was ready. Don't take my word on this, because I'm not too sure about this, but I feel like those who were partaking in Restaurant Week were seated in the back room. Regardless, meats were constantly served and rotated around, so we were very content with that. On the other hand, I felt like service wasn't as attentive with everything else in the back. We had to ask them multiple times before our beverages were served. At the beginning of your meal, you're given a token to flip to green if you want meat and red if you want them to stop serving you meat. My favorite of the meats was definitely the sirloin and the garlic steak. The prime rib was very enjoyable too. Most of the meats were medium rare, some closer to blue. We had a couple of cuts that were medium well, which I personally wasn't a big fan of. But overall, I was content with the meats. It's not as salty as Fogo, but I wish the meat was a little more tender. The cheese breads served for the table were enjoyable and I liked it more than the bread at Fogo. As for the salad bar, everything but the sushi was great. The sushi was definitely on the disappointing side, but you're not at a steakhouse for sushi. Scalloped potatoes was a table favorite from the salad bar, but definitely felt like I was consuming a glob of fat. Dessert was mediocre to me. They market it as mousse but it wasn't as airy as I would like it to be. We had both the passion fruit and chocolate. Passion fruit is definitely better if you prefer tart desserts. Overall, my experience here was quite pleasant. Definitely will leave with the itis after this meal.",2,0,0,Viona C.,"New York, NY",799,170,55
5.0,1/27/2019,"Great place! Great food! Outstanding service! Dynamite salad bar! Delicious cheese bread! Awesome meat selection! Yummy sides. Good dessert.You will eat, eat, eat until your heart and tummy are satisfied. Strongly suggest making a reservation. Great place to visit before or after a Broadway, or off Broadway show. Located a few feet away from the E & C 50th street station. There is also a parking lot across. The restaurant is Adjacent to the New World stage theater. Food is worth the high price point but I suggest taking advantage of restaurant week, and it is also $20 at 20 for off Broadway shows, so treat yourself/ reward yourself, or just because you want good food. How does it work? Make a reservation, arrive, be seated, select as many sides as you like that are included,  so pick 1,2 or all, go to the salad bar as often as you like, when you return to your table  your bread will be waiting. Once you are done eating from the salad bar flip your coasters to the green side, and the waiters will continue to bring meat offerings, as your sides arrive at the table consecutively. They will continue to bring meat to your table until you flip your coaster to red, which means stop. Multiple meat choices, ribs, lamb, steak, chicken pork... don't forget dessert. Very pretty but comfortable venue, clean restrooms and quality service. We will return soon.",3,0,0,Millie R.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,280,1504

4.0,1/24/2019,"Churrascaria Plataforma is an all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse. The price is a bit expensive, but it was a fun experience to try at least once. I went during restaurant week for $42 per person (it's a bit less expensive than the normal price but not all the meats are offered). You can stay up to 2 hours and there is no additional charge if you can't finish your plate. There is a salad bar which has different types of cold appetizers such as roast beef, salads, sushi, stuffed grape leaves. The sushi wasn't the best quality or the freshest but it was satisfying. At the table you can check off which sides you want (mashed potatoes, french fries, fried polenta, etc). I tried the Brazilian cheese bread (pao de queijo) and the mashed potatoes. The pao de queijo wasn't the freshest, but it was decent. The mashed potato was very creamy and smooth but was a little bland. Just don't fill up on the buffet or the sides, save room for the meats! Each person has a token with green on one side and red on the other to indicate if you would like more meat. The servers bring the meats on spits around the restaurant and carves a slice in front of you. Be sure to flip your card over to red if you need a break. They come out fast! I found the meat pretty good, but some were slightly too salty. The chicken was my least favorite. Dessert is also included, but I was not impressed by the chocolate mousse. Service was excellent and very friendly!",10,1,6,Anna L.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",55,287,506
5.0,1/24/2019,"We revisited this wonderful Brazilian steakhouse and were absolutely thrilled that they hadn't changed a bit! We were seated after seeing a matinee on Broadway at about 5:10, and again I requested a table not far from the kitchen...because I'm smart! I also decided against the salad bar, because I  came here for the dizzying array of delicious meats that got served hot, straight from oven to table. The servers remembered that I like my meats rare, and my companion likes his medium rare. Their attention to detail is outstanding!I suggest trying the mashed potatoes as a side, they are excellent, we had several helpings of them. Deserving mention are the prime rib, rib eye steak, top sirloin, and garlic steak. I loved getting an end piece that was also rare. We celebrated my birthday again, I plan to make this at least a yearlyevent, and forego any other restaurant, I found paradise! My companion had the Tiremisu for dessert AND a generous portion of creamy strawberry ice cream. I had the chocolate cake, which was dense and rich which arrived with a sparkler and some cheerful singing for my birthday.Unlike others who feel this restaurant is pricey, I say, get real! this is one of the best rodizio style restaurants in the country and you get what you pay for! Before I left, I had to shake hands with the gentleman who handed me the check..for a job well done!   I am thinking about taking my companion to dinner for his birthday in April, and will make reservations for the same time after a matinee... after all, he's worth it!",0,0,0,Liana V.,"Glen Gardner, NJ",0,3,0
5.0,1/20/2019,"Randomly came here on a Sunday night. There was no wait. The ambiance is not quite as good as other rodizios, and the buffet is a little small. They also have a small appetizer menu that you can choose from. So we got the seasonal vegetables and the deep fried cassava. Cassava wasn't the best, a little oily and tasteless. But there is a good variety of meats. Our only qualm was that the lamb shank kept running out, because they always start at the same spot. So by the time it got to us, they were either out or just had a couple left. I think I've had my fill of Brazilian grilled meats for awhile after this.",1,0,1,Roxanne O.,"Freehold Township, NJ",94,650,866

5.0,1/1/2019,"Although, this steakhouse is a little bit on the pricey side, I definitely believe that you get what you pay for. Compared to expensive steakhouses in the city, where a customer will pay tens of dollars for a single good cut of steak, this place offers numerous cuts of meat (all you can eat) for one single price. From Lamb, Rib Eye, Prime Rib, sausage, Filet Mignon and so much more; I'm quite sure that you'll find something to your liking.The dishes that they serve at the salad bar are also good as well. And to top it off the desert cart that comes at the end of the meal is awesome. I recommend the Tiramisu, Fruit Tart or Napoleon.Cons - The only things that I can complain about is the price can be a little steep, if you come for lunch not all the meats are available and depending on the time you arrive the restaurant might be packed. However, there are ways to get around this. 1. Definitely come during Dinner to get your money's worth 2. Set up a reservation3. The Restaurant offers different package plans which will help cut the cost of drinks. (I've included 3 of them in my review, hope that it helps)So bring a date, family or friends and I am sure that you all will find something to your liking.",3,0,0,Happy N.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",134,11,9

They were seating people who came after us, without even as much as an explanation. Basically this one guy who walks around the seating area just comes by and cherry picks the people with the number or seating available, without checking the order on the list that the hostess had. Which is just pure mismanagement. He had the audacity to seat a couple who came in nearly 20 mins prior, instead of us, who have been waiting for an hour plus. I interjected and we got seated instead. Once we sat down, it was incredible. The food was good, the service was great and we just ate to the brim!

Juicy, tender, and seasoned well. 5/5Plataforma? Steak: Their house steak. Less fatty than Sir Loin. Marbled well, juicy, better for people who dislike large clumps of fat on their steaks. Seasoned well. 5/5Parmesan? Pork Tenderloin?: This was pretty good. Very tender pork with hints of cheesy flavor. Delicious, but didn't eat more than 1 because steak greater than pork. 4/5Skirt steak: Not bad, more meaty than other steaks obviously. Have a try, but save room for the other cuts. 4/5.Garlic steak: Why is this on the menu? It was really bad. Dry, flavorless, and garlic was too overpowering even though I like garlic. Tasted like a sneaker. Skip it. 1/5Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon: TERRIBLE! SKIP!!! Idk how they got this wrong. Bacon was totally undercooked and too oily. The filet mignon had almost no flavor. I expected this to taste amazing. I mean come on, bacon and filet Mignon.....was very disappointed by this. 0/5 They also had sausage and chicken and lamb which I passed on. I would have liked to try the lamb, looked good.Got a birthday cake for free.

The meats come out fast and there's so many cuts. Steak, chicken, pork AND MY FAVORITE, THE LAMB.4.

Two stars because the restaurant itself was nice and large - full bar with a tv up front. Not nice enough to be worth the cost",0,0,0,Brian T.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,13,2

A bit on the pricey side though so be ready to spend. Only thing I have a complaint about was the communication with the staff. Requested a napkin never got it. Asked the host and hostess to wish happy birthday to my friend when I return back to the table and they sang without me so I was very disappointed. I didn't care too much for their signature drink but did like the Brazilian wax. They do provide paid valet parking which was a plus.",0,0,0,Sindhu S.,"East Hanover, NJ",109,34,46
3.0,12/2/2018,"I was really excited to try out this restaurant because of the great reviews but I think it fell a little short in terms of my expectations. Getting a reservation online was super easy and when we arrived for lunch on a Sunday (1pm), the restaurant was semi-empty. Service was outstanding from beginning to end. Everyone was very polite and our requests were tended to right away. After getting an explanation of the process, we headed out to the salad bar. Boy did that leave a lot to be desired but I wasn't surprised nor disappointed because I wasn't there for that. Make note that there is no menu but I actually liked that - you came here to eat meat and that's what you're going to do, no need for the extras, straight to the point. They do give you a small list with all the sides, we were a group of 5 so we went with all of them except the vegetable of the day. The fried polenta was delicious! The rice and beans were ok, the french fries were pretty standard, and the mashed potatoes were a little too watery for my taste. Sadly we never got the fried banana nor the fried yucca we requested although I reminded them twice. As for the meat, they're really not kidding when they say it's non-stop once you turn the coaster green. We were literally bombarded with all types of meats and cuts - it was a carnivore's heaven. My favorites were the top sirloin and the rib eye, the pork sausage was also amazing! The consensus around the table was that the chicken was a big no, but everyone seemed to enjoy all the other cuts, especially the bacon wrapped steak. I was hoping to be blown away by the seasonings but that never happened, the cuts were all very juicy and perfectly cooked but most lacked flavor. Dessert on the other hand was spectacular. They were kind enough to bring my mom a slice of their chocolate mousse cake because we were celebrating her birthday and she loved it. The creme brûlée and tiramisu were great as well. My parents had a cappuccino each after our meal which they also enjoyed. As for drinks, they have a wide selection of wines and cocktails. My parents had a few glasses of cabernet sauvignon and the rest of us caipirinhas which were very yummy and strong. Needless to say we were super stuffed by the time we finished.Overall, although I enjoyed my visit I'm not sure I would go back. I think this is one of those places that might be a bit overhyped, but still nice to check out for a special occasion. Prices are a little steep ($67 for dinner, $47 for lunch + all the add ons like desserts/drinks), so make sure you come prepared with both a substantial appetite and budget.",34,16,24,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2413,357,1200
4.0,11/26/2018,"I love that you can make a reservation for up to eight people on opentable for this place, making it ideal for large parties. Inside, the space is huge and very conducive to large parties as well. The pre-fixe inlcudes only the salad bar, sides and the meats coming around the tables. The salad bar at dinner had sushi pieces. The sides were put on the table and they were mashed potatoes, yucca fries, sweet plantains and cheesy Brazilian bread. The meats that came around included sirloin, prime rib, ribs, cheese crusted pork, sausage, rib eye, chicken and lambchops. My favorite were the rib eye and lamb chops. Those came around less frequently and usually ran out. When they run out they are good about coming back and making sure you get a piece. I asked if there were fish and they brought out special cooked salmon and a white fish. The drinks and dessert are extra so even though the pre fixe price was $65 a person, after a drink, dessert, tax and tip it comes out to over $100 a person.",1,0,1,Cathy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",299,430,1304

If it were too much, all I need to do is cut off the portion myself. Servers were pretty attentive. It may take some time for them to notice your card, but when they see it, they will come right to you.Pretty self-explanatory. If you want the meat, green side, if you need to stop or require a break, red side. Eat until you're full or satisfied. There is also a section in the middle of the main dining room where you could grab salads, sides, and some sushi pieces. I tried a few salmon slices, and they were decent.

The meats are without any seasoning and bland, with fatty cuts and poorly cooked throughout. Ask for medium rare or medium? More like medium well. The sides? Poor excuses at ""unlimited"" food options. The sides are bland and unappetizing. The atmosphere is lame and more reminiscent of a diner than a fine dining restaurant that bills itself the way this sorry excuse for a churrascaria does. Wait staff is inattentive, drinks are mediocre at best, and the wine is clearly not chosen by anybody with training. The best part? You can take a short cab ride, or even better, a brisk walk over east to Fogo de Chao. At Fogo, you get actual meat that is well seasoned, melts in your mouth, and leaves you overstuffed in the best way.

Different types of cheese, pasta, cold meats, and sushi, all of it fresh and delicious! You can bring your non-carnivorous friends here and they will leave happy.

I didn't really try too much of the buffet food as I was trying to fill my stomach up with the rotating meat.

Either way, if you don't like something you can skip it and just chow down on the good stuff, which came around often. To top it off, the unlimited sides are also daunting - best bet is to go for the fried bananas as they won't leave you too full.

5.0,8/28/2018,"This is absolutely the best steakhouse. I've probably been to every good churrascaria and rodizio in the tri-state area and some in PA and MA too. Its my preferred style of dining and the most flavorful way to prepare steaks. I always tell people Plataforma is my favorite hands down and I've been coming back here for years. Their meats are a cut above the competition and the service and accommodation from the waitstaff is second to none. Even the salad bar items are crafted with gourmet quality and care where the competing rodizios treat the buffet as more of an afterthought. But make sure to save room for the meat show, the top sirloin cap or picanha is the best one with the rib eye coming in a close second. And don't leave without trying the slow roasted beef short ribs. I call it the finisher, it is so savory you will be satisfied at that moment. Any eating after that is just to show off to your friends and family. Those of you who cut the fat off your meats think twice, this is the best part. And the rest of you don't insult the chef and skip all the leaner meats they are all delicious and at least worth a try even if you are there just to capitalize on the steaks. I don't know how they keep the parmesan pork so juicy, nobody else can do this. So trust in me and give Churrascaria Plataforma a visit. I am a long-time carnivorist/meatarian so meat is all I know, and I know you won't be disappointed here. For the discerning binge eater, there is no better place to give yourself the ""meat-sweats.""

1.0,8/10/2018,"Seriously Yelp People? You honestly think this place is good??  You have GOT to be kidding me.I should first say, I'm not too thrilled with my lunch taking a stroll about the restaurant before it gets to me, which explains why I haven't done a rodizio style restaurant in the past.  However, I was willing to give this place a shot because of Restaurant Week and the reviews.  Here's the experience:1.  The open salad bar was extremely unimpressive.  There were a number of things like risotto (which was a starchy mushy mess), a cheesy  potato thing, mac salads, etc. which are all unnecessary fillers that cheaply fill you up so you'll eat less of the meat.2.  They give you a sad little veggie plate of 2 broccoli spears and a couple of carrots; a plate of barely fried french fries; a little bowl of beans; a bowl of white rice.  None of which we ate. 3.  The meat (which IS what this is all about), was hard and chewy and had to be spit into a tissue (chicken) to absolutely tasteless (sirloin, lamb).  The only thing that was OK (so I was told) was the prime rib.4.  The folks taking a walkabout with the meats ignored those stupid little cardboard ""Go"" cards, but when they did come by it was mostly with chicken (nope, not again) or sausage (I don't eat this).5.  The Prosecco was sickenly sweet. It was like drinking a sickly sweet bad tasting nectar. I couldn't drink it.  I took 2 sips and that was it.  Turns out, that nauseating little flute glass was $14.  This would've been fine for an actual delightful tasting sparkling Prosecco.6.  Our waiter didn't really speak English well.  When I tried to order ""tea"" he would say ""meat"" and flip the ""Go"" card over.  I flipped it back and again said ""tea."" He flipped it back and said ""meat.""  We did this 4x until I played charades with him, making a drinking motion with my glass.7.  I asked for more water for my tea - I never got it.8.  The value for this entire experience is very poor (even @ the RW lunch price) & absolutely not worth my dining time. One more thing... we sat and sat and waited for someone to see if we needed anything else / needed our check.  No one ever checked on us & it wasn't crowded. We finally had to flag down one of the meat guys to call over our waiter, but even that took awhile. I can't even understand the draw or high reviews for this place.  I wasted a perfectly good RW opportunity to enjoy lunch at a different restaurant.",4,2,1,Jannie M.,"Carteret, NJ",4,70,70
5.0,8/8/2018,There is a God and he created this place... I mean the bar is so sexy great drinks this an amazing place to just snag a drink after work... but lets get down to it... you come here for the MEAT! i mean everything cut of meat is better than the next its literally crazy... make sure to order your drink off the drink cart they make it in front of you its so much fun... this must be the best value in all of NYC we were headed to shakespeare in the park... and lost track of time bc we were eating so much meat haha they ran the desert cart over to us and i am soo happy we stayed for that... again i cant even begin to explain how good this place is..,0,0,0,Ryan Z.,"Manhattan, NY",9,80,4
4.0,8/7/2018,"Went to dinner here with some friends last night for restaurant week and had a great experience. The food and service was perfect from when we entered to the time we left. The favorite meat dish of the table was the Garlic Steak. The salad bar favorites were the mushroom risotto and the prosciutto & cheese stuffed peppers. Highly recommend ordering a fresh fruit Caipirinha. They are made to order at your table, delicious and very strong. Finally dessert. We tried both the chocolate and passion fruit mousse. Both were very tasty, but we were way too full to finish it.Overall, our experience here was really great. The only let down about choosing the restaurant week menu is that you are limited on the type of meats you get. Would have really liked to try the Filet Mignon and Rib Eye, but will have to save that for next time. We would definitely come back and recommend Churrascaria to others.",2,0,1,Ryan T.,"Queens, NY",6,127,132
5.0,8/5/2018,Best churrasco in the city! Our go to for special occasions or when friends are in town. Buffet is unbelievably good but don't fill up. I've made that mistake a few times.

5.0,8/4/2018,"***Restaurant week review***This has to be my BEST restaurant week deal of this season. I've wanted to check this place for some time now and when I saw they were participating in RW I thought I'd go there and get an idea of the cuisine. I honestly didn't expect an ""all you can eat"" menu and guess what? That's exactly what I got. The food: 5/5- There's a salad buffet at the center of the restaurant, where you ca splurge on all kind of delicious vegetables nicely cooked and presented.- Once you finish your salad the servers start to roll out the meats. If you're a meat lover, they will bring it on until you say ""no more, I surrender"". Before the meats were served we got some beans, French fries, and grilled vegetables. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasty.The service: 5/5- The servers keep bringing more and more meat, each time a different one or differently cooked: lamb, beef, pork, chicken. What stroke me is that they would even go back to the kitchen and cook it slightly more if you don't want it medium rare.The decor/venue- Very clean, nicely decorated. Just have a look at the pictures and you'll get an idea.",3,1,1,Steve L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,34,16
4.0,8/2/2018,"I came here for restaurant week for lunch b/c who can pass up an all you can eat steakhouse for $26 (plus tax and tip)?? My friends and I made reservations. When we arrived, we had to wait a few minutes which was fine. We got seated shortly and the manager(?) explained how the system worked to us. My friend and I thought the manager was kind of rude. He was very quick to be dismissive and when he was explaining the card system, he was hovering over me. His whole body was legit on top of me and I tried to take the card to look at it but he snatched it out of my hand to continue explaining the system to us... TIP: STAY AWAY FROM THE SALAD BAR/FILLER MEATS (sausage, chicken, pork, etc) IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH! (Though it is hard)The salad bar is in the middle of the restaurant. It's a free for all, like a buffet. They offer many types of dishes like pesto pasta, potato salad, scalloped potatoes & squash, cheese, rice, customize your own salad, etc. The RW menu came with cheese balls (these were delicious!! our table had to ask for more!), french fries, vegetables and beans. French fries were also pretty good but pretty standard!The meat selection for restaurant week was parmesan crusted pork, lamb, top round steak, top sirloin, sausage, and chicken. The sausage was actually really good. The steak usually comes out medium rare but you can request well done if you want. They will bring it back in the kitchen and cook it for you which I think is nice of them (though I think steak is best at medium rare but to each their own). Several people at my table requested well done and they were very nice about it. My friend got a piece of lamb that was literally raw which he was not too happy about LOL.I do think this place is kind of over whelming but in a good way. The servers are literally so fast to cut you your meat. My friend wanted to tell the server to give my other friend a cut of meat first since he requested well done and if he cut the well done for her, the next piece would've been medium or medium rare. I guess he didn't process what she was saying and he kept saying ""ma'am do you want? do you want? any more for you? do you want?"" so she just took the meat.Since there weren't a lot of people for lunch, the meat gets circled around really quick. Some people's plates were piling up with meat because they could not keep up with the severs. We barely spent an hour at the place and had to tap out because it was too much food for lunch. On the other hand, if you can eat fast and eat lots, then you will most deff get your money's worth! I only ate about 4-5 pieces of meat and could not eat anymore. The experience of the waiters asking me if I wanted more meat even though I didn't finish my previous cuts already made me full. This place is definitely worth going to, especially for restaurant week. Would I come here on a normal day? Probably not as the prices are way higher and I can not eat that much but if you can, then this place is worth it!",3,2,2,Flora L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",209,413,583
4.0,8/2/2018,"Came here with friends for lunch on weekdays (via restaurant  week deal $26 per person... if u want a dessert, add $5) They brought cheese balls and side dishes without asking, which is good, but we don't eat rice and beans so it's kind of wasteful. The meat are super juicy and delicious. I liked the chicken and my friends liked the pork. The steaks are good but not excellent.

4.0,8/2/2018,"RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW ONLYCame after making a reservation online for 12:30pm. We came a bit earlier than our scheduled time, but they seated us right away to the section specifically for restaurant week customers. DRINKSOf course water is free. But if you do want alcohol/soda/coffee/tea, it is not included. And plus every refill cost the amount of another cup. For coffee/tea, it cost about $3. Soda cost about $3.50. Pretty pricey if you ask me. But I guess you save with the food cost. FOODRestaurant week prices are quite good compared to the cost of the average meal here. I like they have an all-you-can-eat salad bar for the first course. They not only have salad, but some cheeses, pasta, etc. A lot of different options, but make sure you don't get your stomach full of this because there are a lot of meats & sides to come. To get the meat coming, you flip the red ""coaster"" type thing to the green side. This signals that you are ready for the slices of meat. The people start coming around with different types of meats. The meats they bring around are massive, but they give you one piece at a time. You have tongs at the table to grab the meat as they cut it. I personally like the top sirloin the best. The meat piece was quite good. The sausage was quite good as well. They also had additional sides of french fries/rice/veggie medley/black beans as well. The only minor changes that I wish was different was the saltiness of the meat. I found some of the meat pieces salty. I found myself drinking a lot. And also it wasn't necessary a problem for me, but I can find that people will have to wait around if they are really picky with the redness of their meat. And lastly, it would be great to have labels for the food at the salad bar. Other than that, it was quite filling. Very worth the $26 price value for a normal $50ish meal. For meat lovers, it would be a dream come true to have the influx of all different types of meat. It's a very unique experience. And you leave quite full at the end of all of this.",3,0,0,Olivia K.,"New York, NY",83,164,406

4.0,8/1/2018,"Reserved for a party of 6 for restaurant week lunch. For $26, it was well worth and plenty of food. Left with bursting buttons and a severe case of ITIS. The salad bar had so many options! Lots of fresh greens, salads, veggies, and healthy grains. There was a scalloped potato and squash gratin as well as a fish dish kept warm on the sides. Other options available were lettuce with make your own salad toppings , kale salad with clementines, tomato and mozzarella, pesto pasta salad with small mozzarella balls, white rice, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, baby carrots, corn, and quite a few types of cheeses.Once you settle down and flip the card to green, the amount of meats heading your way becomes overwhelming. It seems like the servers all come out at once and then all take a break at the same time. If you want your cuts well done, expect to wait longer because they will have to return to the kitchen for it to cook longer. The seasoning of the cuts were not consistent. Some of them were very salty whereas some were not seasoned enough. The top sirloin and chicken were both really good.",0,0,0,Annie K.,"Manhattan, NY",62,163,1377

5.0,7/27/2018,"I came here for restaurant week, and wow, the food was good. I made the mistake of getting too much food at the salad bar, which had a wide variety of foods, including sushi (strange). The meats were so delicious. I'm a beef girl, so I mostly got the beef cuts, which were perfectly marinated and so tender. I got one slice of lamb, but it was quite gamey, so I would say to stay away from the lamb if you don't like gamey meat. Other than that, the food was great! The dessert is either chocolate mousse or passionfruit mousse, and I went with the passionfruit, although I tried a friend's chocolate mousse. Both were delicious!The servers were very attentive. My water cup was full at all times and my plate always had at least two pieces of meat on it.It is expensive, but the quality of the food is so worth the price.

5.0,7/26/2018,"Came here when the wait at Fogo was too long. Got seated immediately.Meat lovers rejoice for this is your heaven. All you can eat meat perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned and best of all - it comes to you.Disclaimer to those who don't know how Brazillian BBQ works. This restaurant is $50 a head (not including drinks). You are given a plate for the Salad bar first. Here's a tip... DONT FILL UP ON THE SALAD! SAVE ROOM FOR THE MEAT! Once you're done with your salad, you're given a two sided coaster that have a STOP and GO on each side.Basically the servers come around with 15 types of meat to your table and you just sit and enjoy it. You place the coaster to the Green GO side when you want to be served. The waiters will see it and come and offer you whatever meat they have, fillet mignon, lamb chop, quail, etc. Once you have enough on your plate, you tun the coaster over to the RED STOP side. Once you've finished your plate, flip it back to the green and rinse and repeat!This place is worth the trip if you're a hungry person and a hearty eater. The quality of meat they use is evident in the taste of the food. The meats are perfectly grilled and perfectly seasoned. They aren't over seasoned so you can still taste the cuts of meat and enjoy them.Don't worry if you're not a big Beef eater - they have poultry and some lamb and pork too. No fish. And if you're a person that only eats well done beef - make sure you tell the server because each skewer has different levels of 'cookedness' from Well done to Medium.Great drinks too.

I did switch to a pineapple after that and it was so amazing (5/5) I had a third.There was a generous selection of cost-inclusive sides; standouts include the fried polenta and yucca flour. The salad bar was very good, I especially liked the mushrooms. On to the meats - excellent. My faves were the picanha and the lamb.The irresistible dessert cart headed on over and I went with the exceptional flan.The price is upscale but not over the top; my check totaled $137 pre-tip & $167 post-tip.

For 4 adults and one child it was close to $500.00 no tip included which is insane! we each had 1 plate food 1 cup soda and that was it. When we asked if we could take one plate home they said it's not allowed because people were taking advantage and then proceeded to throw it away. My picky 4 year old got a normal order of chicken tender with fries and that was $21.00. On top of all this drinks and dessert weren't included because it was mother's day which they also didn't mention on the site.

This place was decently priced for the city and obviously offered a lot of meat selections and the salad bar to hopefully please everyone.The meat here was pretty good but nothing special as compared to other places in less special locations. They don't have any exotic meats and some of their products just weren't good. Some of the meats were very good though which at least allowed us to enjoy the meal. The salad bar is very underwhelming just like at most places and the sides were pretty crappy. It was nice that the servers would tell you if they had certain degrees of doneness. The dessert was also disappointing, their flan was tough and tiramisu and chocolate cake were sub par.

I'm a vegetarian so I'm not the best judge of the meat but my friends enjoyed the octopus and the sirloin with garlic (there was another sirloin cut they got later that they didn't like as much). You could request lamb, salmon, and chicken. According to them, the chicken and lamb were dry and not flavorful. For the sides, the fried polenta was a hit (we ordered two!) and the fried banana was good. Don't bother with the vegetable of the day if it's broccoli - it was just unseasoned broccoli and carrots. The free cheese bread was yummy too. The salad bar had a lot of different options. I liked the sundried tomato risotto, cheeses, grilled eggplant and zucchini, and caprese salad. The drinks and dessert weren't included in the all-you-can-eat price but were delicious, so be careful! For the desserts, my favorites were the flourless chocolate espresso cake and the creme brûlée.

The desserts are also delicious: last time I had the chcolate mousse cake, and this time the chocolate egress flour less cake, and both were better than u'd expect (I'm usually disappointed in desserts at restaurants). It's expensive, but I suppose that's to be expected. The service is really on point. The bathrooms are super clean and nice.

There were a lot of options. But definitely do not get too filled up because you're here for steak, not salad/carbs! The cheese bread was delicious. I loved how they refilled it without us asking. The meat was delicious. Some pieces were tastier than the others. It really depends if you're getting the ends or middle. The ends can be a little dry. We had the sangria pitcher to share. It was fruity and not too strong (I'm a weak sauce). I loved how they went around with the dessert cart; you get to see everything before you determine if you want it or not. We were a party of 4, we ended up spending about $82/ person. It's not too expensive for all you can eat steak IF you can eat. But I personally am not a big eater.

They had steak, chicken, bacon wraps, duck meat, turkey- all kinds of meats. Some were overly salty. I am giving this place 3 stars as it is just mediocre.

4.0,2/3/2018,"Came here on restaurant week for lunch after trying fogo de chao during the last one.We came in the middle of the week at 3:30pm, and the place was pretty empty except for about 3 tables. We were seated promptly and explained how it worked. Being the meat lover I am, I decided to dive straight into the meat and forego the salad bar. Their menu for restaurant week do differ from their regular menu in that there is only a few types of meat, with the main sellers to me being the sirloin, prime rib and lamb.We got a cut of the sirloin and for the most part, was pretty good. I say for the most part because the table behind us wanted their sirloin well done, so we got a few pieces of those and it was definitely not to our liking. The pork sausage tastes like a hot dog but infinitely more saltier. The chicken was a bit dry and over cooked. The prime rib was also mostly well done, which disappointed us (we like our meat medium rare-medium). The servers were extremely nice though, with the person serving the sirloin personally bringing out another rack of sirloin that was medium rare for me. For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse cake. This was actually a surprise for me as the texture of their chocolate mousse cake is a lot more solid than typical ones, which actually made it really enjoyable. I definitely want to know where they bought it or who made it.One issue we had was slow filling of water. Due to some of the meats being extremely salty, we downed our water quite quick and our cups remained empty for a good amount of time. I feel this shouldn't be the case as there were only 4 tables during our whole encounter. Otherwise, the visit was decently enjoyable but I'd still have to give it to fogo de chao. Definitely worth it for restaurant week lunch but if I had to pay full price, I'd go to fogo de chao.",3,0,0,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",217,161,250
4.0,1/31/2018,"This was a restaurant week visit. Overall not bad, but not the best. Came here for a weekday lunch. They have limited options for meats for restaurant week. The rolls given in the beginning were tasty but the middle was basically straight butter. The sirloin was pretty good, most of it cooked between medium rare and well done, so it was pretty tasty. The pork sausage was okay, pretty saltyThe prime rib both times it came around was way overcooked. I am not a fan of well done meat, and there was no pinkness to any of the prime rib meat I received.The salad bar was decent. One of their hot dishes was a fish dish that was absolutely delicious. The rest was alright, some plain salads.For dessert, the chocolate mousse was surprisingly good. It was slightly thicker than normal mousse so was delicious.I do wish they came around to refill water more, because I often found myself waiting for water for a long time.

We were already off to a hangry start when the hostess seemed like she wasn't quite sure what was going on and constantly responded with ""I will ask the manager"" when we asked her when we could expect to be seated. 45 minutes later, we were seated at an awkward round table for 5 people that was up against a wall. The manager who came to serve us was a bit pompous as he asked us if we knew how rodizio works. We all nodded that we did and he told us to get started with the salad bar before turning our coaster cards green. The salad bar was a bit lackluster in comparison to other rodizios, primarily focused on all sorts of cheese and few varieties of vegetables. They did offer sushi and shrimp cocktail as well as a few hot dishes like a rice and cod fish dish. Once we turned our cards green and the meat began arriving, several cuts were on the tastier side including the garlic steak and sirloin. Please pass on the parmesan pork which is severely over cooked and immensely salty due to the amount of cheese. The servers were a mixed bunch, others happier than others. One was particularly rude and muttered under his breath when we politely declined his very overcooked pork. The sides left a lot to be desired as we went during Restaurant Week and were limited to rice and beans and french fries. The rice and beans were surprisingly good but the french fries were definitely nothing to write home about.

When I had first heard of the premise I thought no big deal, I can easily eat a buffalo so I went in intending to get my money's worth. It was restaurant week but I and my friend decided to go for the full monty which was only a $10 price difference during Lunch, $39The place was very impressive and spacious albeit a bit confusing. Someone had blown up the bathroom, That may or may not be the restaurant's fault but it did leave an impression to my olfactory senses. That being said when we were finally noticed a nice man named Nathan attempted to explain the process to us and we nibbled at the delicious lot of 3 bread and cheese pastries they put on our table. Why 3? Did they want us to fight to the death over the last one?When the meat started to come we were kindly offered a slip of paper that listed the sides such as plantains, black beans, rice, french fries, mashed potatoes, etc which came with the course. The rice and beans were just like I remembered when I had traveled to Brazil years ago. Sadly, they give you very meager amounts of the sides so I couldnt reminisce for long and the 8 french fries looked like they needed a hug.But friends, I did not go for the daggone salad bar or sides. I didnt even come for the drinks. I came for MEAT and meat is what I had. I had so much meat I almost wanted to fight the next man who brought another top sirloin to my table. Aside from the very dehydrated bacon wrapped turkey the meat was delicious. The servers seemed to be slow at coming out at first but once they started coming it was like a war zone and a test to my stomach. I didnt like the aggressive one who seemed impatient and practically admonished me not to pull at the meat, how about hurry about as you haphazardly shave it?

Thats fine but we got seated almost 45 mins after the reservation time when she told us it would be a 15-20 min wait. They werent apologetic at all and if anything all of the hosts, waiters, staff were pretty hasty and didnt seem like they cared about the customers experience; the service here was honestly a 1 star. Compared to fogo de chao the staff here are not as friendly, they arent as attentive to detail. When the waiter was cleaning our table he took the bread basket with bread in it and the bread rolled out on to the table and he just left. The people who served the meat were very mean looking and if we said no thank you to the meat they were serving they looked pissed and just left. Some of them when i did ask for the meat didnt listen and just left. And some cut the meat asap and left didnt give me time to grab the meat with the tiny tongs. Only a couple of them were smiling, patient, and nice. We came For our anniversary and wrote it on the reservation but we had to remind them. For dessert they just handed us a piece of cake and left without saying a word. Nothing special, no writing etc. They give no menus here so you dont even know what choices of meats there are until they come and tell you what theyre serving. To be fair, i thought the meat here was pretty good. The flank steak and rib eye were my personal favorites. Hence the extra star. Another con is the salad bar. Very lacking compared to other brazilian steakhouses. They give you appetizers and the vegetable of the day was pretty sad... really simple steamed broccoli and the mashed potatoes were too watery.

Nice Christmas decorations everywhere. // FoodThere's a pretty impressive salad bar that you can get veggies, grains, cheeses and a couple types of meat dishes. Neither of the meat dishes were outstanding but the salad was a good complement to all the meat. My friends were raving about the potato cheese Au gratin dish.I had 12 different types of meat from the meat going around with skewers. I wanted to try every new type of meat possible even if it didn't initially sound enticing. Ones that stood out for me were the prime rib, pork ribs, and Plataforma steak. The other meats were top sirloin, chicken leg, chorizo, garlic sirloin, bacon wrapped turkey, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped filet, cheese covered pork, and flank steak. They also give you some table dishes such as fried breaded bananas (delicious!), fried polenta, and pao de quiejo (cheese bread balls).

1.0,11/26/2017,"The dinning experience was totally horrible here on a thanksgiving night 11/23/2017. We made reservation weeks ago, called to confirm, got our credit card on hold, but still had to wait for 45 minutes in line to get seated. The front door were filled with waiting crowd who made reservations. Everyone was frustrated since this situation screwed everyone's schedule. This reservation strategy is their business trick to get more customers waiting for tables than they can physically hold. You can reserved and there's always tables available but prepare for your long waiting after you checkin. The ladies at the checkin desk were also hating the process and yelled at customers that they are also waiting for tables instead of telling us how long the waiting could be. As the waiting was long, the waiters kept bringing cheese break as comforting lol. But please bring steak and BBQ, yes just fill your angry customers with bread and water before they ate one piece of your 70 dollar Brazilian BBQ buffet.Now talk about food:We chose our side dishes as vegetable of the day. It turned out to be a tiny plate of over boiled soggy broccoli. Seriously ?The bbq beef was either over cooked or under cooked. One of my cut was almost raw while my friend's cut from the same serve was medium well. It just depends on your luck. The lamb only came three time in 2 hours. Pork, sausage, bacon wrap chicken and other Cheap meat came so much more often than quality good cut. The salad bar is very disappointing. The seafood salad is not fresh. The shrimp was still covered by ice from the fridge. The cheese cubes, pickled vegetables, pasta all taste like instant products from grocery store.  We won't come back since there are so much better Brazilian bbq in NYC.",2,0,1,Daniel S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,70,178

Oh and their service is quick and friendly too =D!! Aside from that... I didn't enjoy some of the desserts. I wouldve been OK if they were part of the dinner cost, but as they were separate charges, I'll leave separate reviews for them below (note: they did tell me they're not included in the meal, so I expected awesomeness here just like the meats);- Crème brûleé is super sweet and really good- Flans are too solid for my taste but good- Tiramisu... will be skipped next time - Coffee is bit too acidic for my taste- Lambada is coconutty goodness of alcoholic drink.

4.0,11/8/2017,"This restaurant was such a new and fun experience for my birthday celebration. Here is a breakdown of my experience doing dinner on a Tuesday:Service: Since it is rodizio style, our waitstaff was faster than lightening. The minute we turned over our cards from red to green, we were swarmed with waiters offering us food and clearing our salad plates.Ambience: Very large space, nice tablecloths with a big buffet table in the middle of it all.Food: Some cuts of meat were definitely better than others. The cheese-crusted pork and filet mignon were dry and nothing special. Personally, I think it's a bit much to add bacon to an already delicious cut of meat in terms of the filet. Favorites however, included their sirloin and flank steak which were thinly sliced and so juicy! Nailed the medium rare game here. I recommend sticking to the lamb and steak if you want bang for your buck! I passed on the sausage so I cannot give my opinion. As for the salad bar, it was ok. The selection is great from sushi to pasta to tomatoes with sliced mozzarella! You'll definitey find something that appeals to you, but to echo everyone, grab a small plate and call it quits! You don't want to fill up before you flip that card.Price: Prepare to drop a lot of money. The fixed price style starts you off by default at $65 a head for weeknight dinner. We opted for no dessert as it isn't included and nor is alcohol. After a glass of Malbec and a Peroni, our total came to $160 pre-tip. Overall: If you've never eaten at a rodizio style restaurant and want a fun and gourmond experience, come here! It seems like a great opportunity for groups and the wait time is non-existant. The card flip system is cool knowing you are in full control of your pace and the waitstaff was even cracking jokes with us and showing off their meat (har-har) to tables to tempt even when ours were red. Come starving, wanting a buffet like experience and with lots of cash and you'll be golden.Happy 20th anniversary to this establishment!",2,1,0,Alex O.,"Queens, NY",117,226,24

3.0,11/5/2017,"I came to this place with high expectations after having a decent first experience over at Fogo De Chao. My friends and I decided to come here for a birthday celebration one Saturday evening. We made our reservation for 6:30 and we were seating promptly then. The venue was packed when we went as I would highly recommend making reservations beforehand. We were started off with a plate of their cheese baked bread as a small appetizer. After that, we headed over to the salad bar for some small refreshments. I don't know why I even bothered, but I grabbed a couple of pieces of sushi and it tasted horrible. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it. I should've known better to not grab sushi from a steak place haha. Other than that, they had several different types of cheeses, fried calamari and salads. Pretty weak salad bar selection compared to Fogo De Chao if you asked me. I'd say stick with their set appetizers such as the fried polenta, fried banana, vegetable of the day, mashed potatoes and rice and beans instead of the salad bar. As soon as we turned our cards over to the green side, we were severed a plethora selection of meats. My favorites were the top and bottom sirloin, lamb chops, bacon wrapped turkey and their steak selections. There were also several pushcarts serving beef ribs and risottos if you're into that. The meat were pretty decadent the first few times around, but after that, we were all consumed by the high sodium levels. As for dessert, I don't know how that works. There was a cart of desserts left unattended by the salad bar. My friend assumed it was safe to grab a plate of mini cakes and bring it back to the table. Only to have one of the staff members notice and say ""where'd you get that? It's not on the menu so you can't have that."" If it wasn't up for grabs, then why was it by the salad bar?? I later asked one of the waitresses if dessert was included in the dinner pricing only to find out that it was $10 +tax extra. We later left and bought dessert outside figuring that it wouldn't be worth it here. Over all, I'd recommend Fogo De Chao as opposed to this place.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I truly ""am a fan"", BUT I have some tips/warnings for folks:1) Know which meats they're offering and be sure to ASK for any meat you want. We noticed that they continually rotate some of the lesser expensive meats, but never once came to us to offer some of the more expensive and rare meats. This isn't an accident. They will ask if you want sirloin steak probably 15 times, but they will NOT offer you octopus unless you ask.2) The wines -- ehhh. Come here for the caipirinhas, not the wine. My rose tasted super acidic, really cheap, and I regret it was $17. A caipirinha is $14 I think and is very well made.3) Salad bar leaves much to be desired, but it does have the staples.

Its nice that they can cut the meat in different parts to match what level of rare you like. Having so many options was awesome but I was full after just a few different cuts.

5.0,8/14/2017,"I call it ""Churrascaria Fataforma.""  Seriously, you cannot go to this place if you don't have an appetite.  There is enough of a choice for everyone - meat and non-meat eaters alike. This is my favorite Churrascaria outside of Brazil. This review is for the dinner.  The lunch is a bit lighter on the choices.Let's get this out of the way - for non-meat eaters, you can get the salad bar only option (much less expensive).  The bar has beginner sushi, fish, stuffed grape leaves, olives, typical salad bar stuff, full entree-type choices and no limit on visits.They take away your green/red card when you get this option.Vegetarians and pescatarians, you're done - now, for the real gluttons (meat-eaters), you can seriously go to town when you flip your card to the green side.  I highly suggest the Picana (pronounced Pee-kan-ya) cut - get it very rare.  This is a top sirloin cut and is seasoned (I don't know how) in a way that is addictive. There is a bacon-wrapped turkey, prime rib, flank steak, sausage, and sometimes other cuts.  I was disappointed that they did not have chicken hearts. The waiters walk around with skewers/slabs of meat and cut you individual pieces that you take to your plate with your own tongs.If you like drinks, the Caipirinha is pretty good - they go light on the lime, unfortunately.  You can suck them down very quickly, so consider moderation. The one thing I miss about the Brazil Churrascarias is that they have a Caipirinha station they bring to your table and make them right in front of you.  They cut up a half a lime, add sugar, cachaça and mix and mash it up with the ice right in front of you.  That would be a great addition to this place.If, by some ridiculous chance, you actually have room after you've stuffed your face, stomach, esophagus, and hollow legs with meat, there is the dessert cart.  The cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake were big hits.  You can even get a cup of fresh cut fruit.Service was attentive and timely.  Water glasses stayed full even after the bill was paid.  There was a very nice live band (piano, bass and drums) that added to the atmosphere.There is a dress code, so no tank-tops for you fancy-schmancy men.I love, love, love this place.",7,1,0,Cory N.,"Cortlandt, NY",184,219,127

I also loved some of the grilled fruit/vegetables such as grilled glazed pineapple.

Go lights on the salad and carbs, since you need to save room for the endless meat. Make sure you ask what meat is offered and start with lamb chops right away. Like all restaurants like these, they wait till you stuff yourself with turkey, sausages, chicken and other food that does not cost much, before they bring out the more expensive different types of meat.

4.0,5/29/2017,"Great service and delicious meats. Downsides are that the salad bar is completely misrepresented on the Yelp page - the sushi was exclusively vegetarian (who wants a heart of palm roll?), there was no shrimp of any sort, no cured meats, etc. It was very basic salad ingredients. Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil are infinitely better in this arena. On the meat front, there was a ton of meat options and servers were constantly roaming, so they win here on sheer variety. Really weak in the sauce department also - only a homemade vinaigrette and a spicy hot sauce. Sides were mixed. Plantains were incredible but the beans were lukewarm and mashed potatoes tasted like pre-made.Service was odd in that were were constantly attended to but requests to an exceptional amount of time. Didn't have alcohol or drinks except the Diet Coke was flat or off-brand soda.

3.0,5/15/2017,"2017-2000 = 17. It's been 17 years since I've been here. Back then, I thought it would never get any better then this. I also thought my shit didn't stink. Things in 2000 I thought were true:The Mets were gonna win a World Series in the next 3 yearsMy Uncle Pepe paid for dinner and I thought, ""Thank God, that's $35 more for weed""Tad's was the second best steak house I'd been to, after this placeDiddy was the fucking worstCurrently true: I forget, sometimes, the Mets even still existTotal bill: $105, TOL: ""Do you know how much weed I can buy with that!""Tad's on 34th is gone Diddy is the anti-christ I've been to the usual suspects for churrascaria in the metro-area. The one big difference between this place and others is the buffet. Clearly, any professional AYCE warrior would never fill up at the buffet, but that's beside the point. This place has the worst buffet of any churrascaria I've dined in. It was beyond basic, it was an afterthought. After one flyover, I never went back, because lets face it, we are here for the meat. Cough. The usual processions of meats paraded the large space. The best were the lamb chops, ribeye, and the "" prime rib "". I'm not sure if sitting near the bar was the prime suspect, but those options came only once or twice in my two hour dining extravaganza. The stuff I'm not into as much: chicken sausage, turkey, pork ribs, etc...rotated most frequently. Insert conspiracy theory here.  Warning: if you get the seared outside part of any of the meats, they're very salty. Those fried sweet bananas are no accident. Eat it with plenty of water or your tongue will hate you post meal. They let you choose what you want as sides now. Before, they used to just bring it all out. It's smarter from an economic standpoint to do this for the restaurant. Unfortunately, this lead to the second disappointment of the night: the ""veg of the day"". (See pics for a visual) Like the buffet, this also was an afterthought. I get you came here for the meat, but damn, give me a little foreplay before you fuk me for my money, honey. Show me you're making an effort other then steaming two pieces of sad broccoli and a carrot. The salad bar was bad enough, but damn.  Oh, you'll want that sauce option, btw. It's a flavor-town special. As a former husky kid, I had to have the crème brûlée post meal. I copied/pasted that. Regret soon followed, though. Besides being an additional $10, it was more whip cream inside and not custardy at all. I started to think all that salt was the set up for you not to say no to that dessert cart. Genius, boys. Pure, evil genius. The service here is superb. Everyone is gracious and some, are funny AF; they are superior to the food. How often does that happen in life?Quick side follow up story to the service: I really enjoyed this one server, Ivanir(?), I think was his name. He was hysterical; had us cracking up. So, at the end, I slipped him a few extra bucks in his side pocket, just for him. But, they way it went down, it just felt like I was tipping him like a stripper, cuz the pocket was right beside his package. Super awkward, but fuck it, it's only awkward if you make it awkward, right? So, to use my favorite Love & Hip Hop catch phrase, at the end of the day: it's a fun place for a gimmicky, interactive, meat experience on Uncle Pepe's or your boss's expense account.  That said, for this price, you can get a very good cut of higher quality steak, at a high end steakhouse, minus the meat sweats. This joint is all about stuffing your face with as many meat options as possible until you're on the cusp of throwing up. :: looks at camera :: I wonder, when I revisit this place, 17 years from now, if I'll feel the same way still... about Diddy.

Don't even get me started on the meats. The first (and last, had to finish strong) one we had was the prime rib and it was probably the best pieces of meat I've ever had. It melts in your mouth and the flavors just create a party in there like no other. It was juicy and flavorful, everything a steak should be. The other meats were also great, but my favorite was definitely the prime rib (it comes by in a cart). As long as your token is green up, the meats will keep coming until you probably regret not turning it to red up. The service was also great, everyone checking in on use a the right time, asking us which meats we wanted to come back around.

Trust, servers WILL try to stuff you with the less expensive meats.4. This is a marathon, not a race. When the prime ribs, steaks, etc. come out eat slow. This is your time to figure out what you like and don't like. 5. After step 4, go to the bar and fill your plate with a few side dishes. 6.

Two-sided, one red, the other green you want to keep it turned on the green side for as long as possible. This is the signal that will be honored by your servers who will know that you remain a gluttonous fiend ready to take down more meat.Enter the server, your high priest of meat, who will begin the sacred ceremony by appearing before you holding a large cut of meat that has as skewer through it. Ready to carve, he will motion to you to take the tongs on your table and aide in the removing of the sliced meat.Repeat until insanely full.You can also specify to the server what section of meat strikes your fancy. Perhaps that area is too rare or you'd prefer something more medium. You will be accommodated.There is something quite primordial about having round after round of meat brought to you on a skewer that is then expertly sliced for your pleasure. For a brief period in our overly democratic egalitarian world, you can feel like a medieval autocrat or monarch, think Henry VIII, Ivan the Terrible or Genghis Khan. The chip flip is like the Roman thumbs up or thumbs down in the Colosseum. This is what food power feels like, pushing the limits of appetite to new limits and embracing the infinite.After a nearly 90 minute embrace, I was done and didn't eat for the rest of the day.The Restaurant Week special is especially worth the $29 for effectively endless chicken, pork loin, pork sausage, top round steak and top sirloin. Sides include black beans, white rice and french fries. I feasted exclusively on the steaks, learning my lesson from a previous visit that the salad bar is mainly a distraction and the quality of the other meats, while good, isn't as good as the steak. The rodizio tradition is about steak anyway so let's honor that.Speaking of the salad bar, I found it useful as that's where larger plates are stored and the chimmichurri sauce. Be warned not to stray from the path and give in to temptation of leafy green fillers that will divert you from the noble quest for meat. Many a religion talks of their holy man spending time alone where the devil tries to tempt them. Do not give in!Restaurant week also included a choice of dessert, chocolate mousse or passion fruit mousse. By the time you are ready for dessert you probably won't care.Exit the spacious restaurant and think about what you just did to your body.

I quicly learned that all pork was a bit dry so I skipped that; was disappointed over some overcooked sirloin but than things went in the right direction. I just put the overdone meat on the side waiting for something better. It slowly went in the right direction and my personal favourite was the Pichana which for me had the beat taste, a bit salty and tender.

4.0,12/30/2016,"I am a fan of this place. My boyfriend came home one night raving about his Brazilian Steakhouse experience he had while he was traveling for work. I thought it sounded fantastic and wanted to try it locally. And I found this place! It was perfectly timed, we came here for our anniversary dinner (and we recently got engaged too). It was a nice treat for the both of us. Even from the outside, you can tell the restaurant means business. It stands out on the street, and in New York, that's a hard thing to accomplish. We were greeted immediately when we walked in. We arrived earlier than our reservation time and they were able to seat us quickly. It was my first time and there was a lot to learn. The meat comes to you, not the other way around. The green and red coasters are to indicate whether you want meat or don't want meat (respectively). I thought the service was pretty solid. The servers are quick when they see you have a green coaster and they come around often.Now for the food...I've had some 5 star experiences and some 3 star experiences. Let's start with the meat: the rib-eye, sausage, chicken, sirloin and pork ribs were 5 stars to me. The iffy ones were the lamb and the flank steak. Didn't even finish the entire piece they gave me. The salad bar is a solid 5 stars. They have some pretty good options and they were incredible. I only ordered two sides since we wanted to save room for the meat. The black beans and fried bananas were solid, I'd say 4 stars. The real insult was the cheese bread they put on the table when you first sit down. That was nasty. It was the worst tasting cheese stuffed bread I've ever had. It was to the point where I felt insulted that they served that to me, especially at a high class restaurant as this. Why bother? You have such good food at this restaurant, don't start me off on a bad note.Overall, had a great time here. Will be back again in the future!",3,1,1,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",507,704,665

Of course the meat was very high quality and cooked very well. The sticker price for the meat is $65, but they offer discounts for children.

Not once were we looking for a server or wondering when the next succulent meat would arrive. It felt like the best kind of meat gauntlet you could think of. They just kept coming at you left and right and with the slicing precision of a surgeon ensuring you a perfect cut each and every time.As far as the meats go, I'd say they ranged from good to fantastic. The definite standouts were their prime rib (so tender and flavorful and the bloodier the better), their pork ribs (which were surprisingly delicious), and the parmesan crusted pork loin (tender, juicy, and a nice salty crispness from the crust). Notable mention would be their garlic steak, Plataforma steak, sausage link, chicken leg, and bacon wrapped filet. The rest were pretty much forgettable, but hey, they can't all be winners and you gotta try em all.Now, if you're a rookie to the glory that is a Brazilian endless meat steakhouse, you may be enamored by the plethora of options in their ready to go buffet section. However, while you can definitely get your grub on there, I urge you to walk the wiser path and allocate the majority of your stomach space to their meats which are easily the star of the show. See the buffet as simply a primer, or a appertif if you will. For this section, I would recommend trying some of their Feijoada. In it, you'll find sausage and also pork on the bone which will give you quick rehearsal before the real meat party begins. Other items to grab are the chunks of cheeses and feel free to get your veggie on as you can look back to that while in a meat coma later thinking you at least had something healthy.Their caipirinha was not cheap at $15, but it was damn good and I'd get it again in a heartbeat.  I'd return here in a heartbeat too. However, as great as this meal was, it's not something I would do very often. It's been a few weeks now since my epic meal here and I still think I'm full.",8,4,5,Darren B.,"Austin, TX",367,949,2635

2.0,10/21/2016,"Sorry, I have to go against the grain of the other 1,000 reviews this restaurant has received and award a low score.We were a fairly large party and after walking into the lobby and checking in, a manager promptly came up an offered each of us a free drink if we would move into the bar area to make space.  We happily obliged and thought that things were going swimmingly- until it was time to sit down at our table and one of the bar servers came running after us telling that we had to settle our bar bill before sitting down. I'm not quite sure I understand- the manager offered a round of drinks but then after the fact they ran after us to pay for them? We even asked the bartender what was included in the managers offer and he said anything, which is why it was so confusing. As far as the food, it's a Brazilian steakhouse- and  an expensive one at that. I don't eat much meat, and certainly didn't come here for the food - I would have been quite content just enjoying my party's company and nibbling on the sides- however, despite the fact that I left the little paper coaster on the red ""keep away"" side, the servers repeatedly kept putting skewers of seemingly undercooked meat in my face, trying to get me to take some. After the 5th or 6th round of this, enough was enough, it was making me nauseous, and I had to walk out, having been able to eat absolutely nothing. When you're not a big meat person, continually being pushed to try each meat when your paper coaster is clearly set to red or ""no thanks"" was completely inappropriate and disrespectful. Totally get that there's meat on skewers and that others in my party want some that it's going to be at your table, but you don't need to repeatedly try to force me to eat it after I've said no thanks.

Because the space is quite open and grand and has a buffet station in the middle it felt like 'a canteen' rather than a private dining resto with dim lights, for example.",0,0,0,Watch O.,"New York, NY",3,71,19
4.0,10/19/2016,Went to celebrate my wedding anniversary and had a reservation with my celebration notes in the comments. We were seated right away and our drink orders taken. My drink was mixed up but the waiter quickly corrected it. The salad bar was delicious and full of an array of delicious delicacies. Once back at our table we checked off the additional sides we would like to have and flipped our cards over to prepare for the meat course. The meat was all quite delicious and we were always asked how we liked it cooked before offered a piece. We were full quickly but determined to taste the lamb chop and the staff made sure to get it fresh from the kitchen for us. Our waiter made sure we tried every meat there was to offer and was very sweet. So sweet that when we said we were done with dessert he came with a complimentary cake and sparkler to sing to us for our anniversary.,0,0,0,Jodie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,69,35

I went on a weekday for lunch, and the restaurant was fairly empty - maybe because people don't want that kind of meal in the middle of the work day, maybe because the tacky Halloween decoration scared off locals.

1.0,10/2/2016,"I was so excited to bring my girlfriend and friend to the restaurant.  I'm ok with Brazilian steakhouses but they must be from Japan  it started with a flurry of salads from the salad bar. If you're looking to get a free ride to the hospital check out the potato salad.   Everything up there looked ok but was bland and tasted horribly.  One bright spot was the two cheese wheels.  Then on to the meat.   They bring you as much as you can eat. It from the first bite I couldn't take anymore.  Everything was getting worse and worse until finally we noticed the lamb chops.  Boy did they look good, I was so very wrong. They tasted worse than a my horses piss.  They charge for dessert, sofas and everything else they can. I wouldn't recommend a $100 a person dinner here for sure. Only comfort in the whole plan love was the staff was LAs ways on on top of you trying to please.  It's hard to be happy when you feel This terrible after you leave.",0,3,1,Robert A.,"Chinatown, Las Vegas, NV",53,13,1

5.0,9/17/2016,"One of our favorite restaurants ever! Been coming here for many years and the food, cleanliness, and service remains consistently high quality. Service: From the moment you walk in the door, the service is exceptional. There are at least four-five front of the house managers (maitre d's?) walking around ensuring everything is running smoothly and ensuring customers are taken care of. Entire wait staff, servers, etc...extremely friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable of the food. There was always someone making sure the ""salad bar"" area is clean. They have a woman (you won't be able to turn down ordering a drink or two when you see her) walking around with a ""mobile bar"" making table side drinks. Restaurant: Super clean...overly clean...I do not eat at buffets ever...but this is my only exception. Very nice inside. Food: Keep your card on the red side if you don't want any meat and flip to the green side if you want to be served. Wide variety of meats constantly being served table side. The meats are high quality, fresh, delicious and not too salty (some reviews mentioned the meat was too salty, but not our experiences). Offer meats cooked all temps-well, medium, rare. They also leave a card on the table for you to check off the sides you would like with the meats. All you can eat...literally...all you can eat. And, no guilt! They never make you feel like you are eating too much! The salad bar has a wide variety of, well, salads...and cheeses, sushi rolls, shrimp cocktail, etc...just a mix of foods. Again, I cannot stress how clean the salad bar is kept. We did not do dessert tonight, but they have a dessert cart that the servers bring to your table to select your desserts. I will not go to any other Brazilian restaurant in Manhattan, as I love this place too much and need not search for anything ""better""-because it probably doesn't exist. FYI...I don't know if there are menus...be ware...I think the all you can eat is like $65 per person...does not include desserts and drinks (obviously). Well worth the money.

The biggest offense was the ""fried plantain"" served with dinner which was code for bananas covered in breading and fried.

It was excellent pork.The salad bar and sides were incredibly lackluster. Would not recommend any of the items there.

Parking: You can get parking validated here at ICON parking across the street. Definitely do it and don't forget.Interior: Super big. Not as fancy as you would think because I came in with a casual button down and jeans. You don't need to dress up but for the vibe I'd suggest you do. Bathrooms are downstairs if you need to wash your mouth or floss its there! Smart and sleek this place is.Food: Steak on steak on steak. Turn your card over to green (signals the servers to come to you) and wait for every type of steak to come to you. Always say yes and try everything because you are paying a butt load of money to eat there lol. Best meat is the filet mignon. The salad bar is a great start even though I got everything but salad such as sushi, potatoes, mac and cheese, etc.Dessert & Drinks: These DO NOT come with the prie fix cost so be aware. Anything in the carts I believe are extra. The dessert seem okay nothing too great but everyone should come here and get a bottle of wine. Whether it is cheap wine or not it was very tasteful with the steak.Service: The one off start is because all the servers weren't as into it as you would think. I got a few servers who were great and even push you to eat their meat there serving but others are just coming around without saying a word and making me feel like what they have ain't good. It would just be extra nice of them to not make it weird for me to say yes to such a nice restaurant.

5.0,6/21/2016,"I really loved Churrascaria Plataforma! This is one of those rare instances that I would give a 5-star rating. It's not the food that was 5 stars (the food is more like 3), but it was the service and the entire experience overall.I came in on a Wednesday with ressos for me and my boyfriend. It was his birthday so we decided to splurge and head over to a Brazilian AYCE steakhouse. It was between this one and another one but the deciding factor was that this one had sushi at their salad bar. To start, they bring you some mini (piping hot) cheese bread. These were amazing! You'll want to keep eating it but don't - because that's how they get you. Fill up on these carbs at the beginning and you won't be able to have as much meat. Same goes for the salad bar. They've got salads, pasta salads, rice, sushi, just about a little bit of everything. Nothing really outstanding but this too will fill you up quickly. So try not to eat with your eyes here because you'll want to save room for the main act.This is where you will want to use your coaster. Red means you're full. Green means to keep the meat coming, and they definitely do. Prime rib, filet mignon wrapped with bacon, pork chops, lamb chops, spare ribs, chicken wings, and those were the only few I could remember. Test it out, see what you like and what you don't like. I'd recommend trying everything before getting seconds of something. There's just a huge variety you don't want to miss out on. And don't worry - if you have it on red, you can always flip it back to green when you're ready. I'm not sure if there's a time limit but they gave us plenty of time to eat. My favorite part was probably the capirinha station. But at $18 a pop, it was pretty expensive. However, you get to customize it to however you like it. You can choose the flavor you want - passion fruit, lime, strawberry - how much sugar you want in it, and how strong you want it (extra strong for me!)I also told them it was my boyfriend's birthday and if they could bring out something special. So they brought out a cheesecake with sparklers, which was a nice touch. I would say - don't go for the food but go for the experience.

5.0,6/5/2016,"Fantastic dining experience. I brought my boyfriend here as a surprise birthday dinner, and was nervously hoping that all the great reviews were true. If you know you're going there a few days in advance, stick to veggies leading up to that point. You will have copious amounts of meat at this place. There is the buffet-style open salad bar, which servers various kinds of salad, asparagus risotto (fantastic!), and salmon. Make sure you start there and stock up on the veggies. Once you flip your card from red to green, which means ""Go,"" they will ceaselessly bring out different kinds of steak, pork, turkey, etc.I was especially impressed by their speedy service. All the servers seem to have an acute sense of spotting green cards on diners' tables, because you don't wait more than 30 seconds between different meats are served.Our favorites were the sirloin, fried polenta (comes out as a side if you check the box next to it), and pork with Parmesan. We liked that they have authentic Brazilian side dishes, written out in Portuguese, and an extensive list of cachaça. Two other things we enjoyed other than the food and service: their premium caipirinhas are made right at your table, and there is live bossanova music playing throughout the night.

We walked in late on a friday night with no reservation and they seated us immediately with no issue. Water and bread were on the table within seconds! (Hot cheesy bread is the best)The only issue we had was i ordered a tom collins with lemon (NO Lime). I always make it clear to the waiter that i can't drink it with lime and it needs to be lemon...It came with lime. I asked them to remake it, he took it back brought the exact same drink back with the limes still in it and a bowl of lemons. At this point we were half way thru dinner and just gave up. on the plus side my water was never empty and The Amount of meat that will be consumed is insane. The waiters came back to back with different types of delicious meats. We were offered the sirloin, garlic beef, fillet mignon wrapped in bacon, ribs, chicken, sausage,fried cheese (omg), lamb, and i believe ribeye. The sirloin and fried cheese were personal favorites.The dessert cart thats roaming around is incredible. They have everything from cakes and puddings to truffles and fruit platters.

And when you are on a restaurant you take your leather baseball cap off with the gold superman logo on it off. I'll give it another shot at a off hour, perhaps there was coupons given out or 2 for one, I don't know. And please start cooking your meat a bit better, medium is not rare, and rare is not raw.

You're gonna be super-full here, super-fast. You turn that little card over and the food will start coming at you fast-and-furious. I thought all the meats, possibly with the exception of the flank steak and the lamb, were excellent. The sausage is better than most other places we've been to- as were the pork dishes. The Feijoada is probably the best I've ever had (I'm no connoisseur though), though I've seen much better salad bars at other churrascarias. The sides were a bit forgettable, but the drinks were strong and tasty (though a bit on the small side).

5.0,5/5/2016,"Visited: May 4th, 2016 for dinner.This is an awesome foodie spot, I must say. If you haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse before,here's how it works: you get seated, you get a little card with 2 sides ""green"" to get more food or ""red"" to be left alone to savor, alongside endless salad bar and some hot side dishes you can choose from ... We went in for a date night/birthday celebration on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty full - from couples to larger groups as well. Our Maitre D was Leo and he was absolutely fantastic - very accommodating, courteous and friendly. In fact all the staff provided a great and very fast service. Sooo... the food. The salad bar was nothing to write home about BUT the mozzarella-tomato-basil salad was absolutely delicious. The mozzarella was fresh, fresh, fresh to no extent. Everything else was average. We picked out fried bananas and french fries as sides, made a plate to share from the self-serve bar and enjoyed a cocktail before we started. Here's tip #1: DO NOT fill up on salad and sides, you will be full before you know it and wouldn't get a chance to savor the rest of the goodness...Once you flip the card to the green side, it can get very overwhelming fast. Servers will start circling around you table with all kinds of meats and cups and your plate will fill up fast. We had quite a few different cuts. Pro tip #2: Fill up your plate, turn the card to red and enjoy then flip your card to green when ready. We had a few different cuts - sirloin steak (easily the best cut of the night, my personal favorite), filet mignon wrapped in bacon (pretty great), lamb chops (OMG, yes), brazilian sausage  (juicy, fatty and packed with a ton of flavor), Parmesan-crusted pork (didn't care for it at all), chicken legs (perfectly cooked). The cuts are generous, you can ask for a second on third right then and there. I had a few of the lamb chops, not going to lie, they were delicious. We ended the night with some German forest cake and waddled out to our car full of delicious food.  A dinner for 2 will run you about $150-200 depending on the drinks but it is a well-worth it experience.The only note I would make is, PLEASE get rid of the fake grape vines ... it cheapens the look of the place ridiculously, but I know I nit-picking at this point.Would definitely recommend this place!",2,2,1,Kai Z.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",27,101,29
5.0,5/3/2016,"Thoroughly enjoyed this with an old friend last night. It's really very good, especially if you're a lover of good meat. The salad bar is quite good - there's good variety but lets face it - you go to a place like this for great cuts of meat.The selection of wines (that vary from $40 to mostly in the the $150-500 range) is well worth noting. We just had a glass of Rioja ($14) and Chianti ($14) - very drinkable, goes well with steak.Also, I have to call out the excellent service and hospitality. You get a real feeling that the staff enjoy working there and are proud of their product.How it works: you sit, you get a card that you can flip when you want more food (green side) and when you want to be left alone to sink into a food coma (red side).Some of the great meats we got on what we called the ""skewer circuit"" : Prime Rib, Skirt steak, Flank Steak, Hanger steak, Garlic steak (nice garlic flavour), Filet, Roast Port (with some lightly cooked pineapple pieces), Chicken legs, Delicious brazilian pork sausages (quite juicy, fatty, very good falvours, quite short - about 1-1.5"" - nice break from the steak).You can select as many sides as you want - rice, fries, beans etc I didn't invest a lot of time in the sides or salads but the rice was good, as were the fries.Really good for groups and business meetings - its nice to get up for a walk and visit the salad bar. Whats also great is that people with a big appetite can eat without disturbing those who aren't - so everyone's a winner. I'd recommend this for: meat lovers, Brazilian food lovers, people with a big appetite, corporate expenses types :)Not recommended for: people on a budget (although if you go before 4 or meet their discount options - like being a senior citizen, being in the army), vegetarians, people who want latin American food like tacos, nachos, empenadas etc. This is beef-on-beef baby.",0,0,1,David Q.,"Manhattan, NY",31,29,16

We chose this place based on reviews, but I think the reviews are skewed by tourists since this is so close to the theater district. The food isn't bad, but the prices are outrageous for the quality of the cuts of meat and the salad bar. The only comparison I have is Texas de Brazil in Miami, but the quality and freshness of Texas meats far outweighs this place. I also felt like the ingredients used in the salad bar items were a mix of fresh and canned ingredients. Nothing was bad about the meal, but seasoning was off and a lot of the meat just wasn't super high quality.

I somehow made room for dessert and tried the flan it was perfectly made the only thing I did not enjoy was the bitter syrup/sugar melted over.

We went with the veggies, yuca flour with bacon, fried bananas We made our way over to the salad bar which included, greens, veggies, cheese, sushi, salami and such. I had salad and grilled veggies. After we finished our salads and small dinner rolls placed on the table we flipped out cards green. The servers come out immediately. I decided I would try everything. My husband stuck with beef. Our favorites included the flank steak, garlic steak and the top sirloin. I enjoyed the pork ribs and leg of lamb. I also tried the sausage, chicken and turkey wrapped in bacon. I would pass on those options next time. They weren't terrible just average, nothing to rave about. What I did not finish was the filet mignon wrapped in bacon which was tough and dry. When we couldn't possibly fit anymore we flipped out cards red.We ordered an espresso which was excellent and we shared a flan which was also very good. Service here is excellent!

They were overpriced.  My friends old fashioned was small and not made correctly.  Another friend complained hers was small and too sweet.  Honestly though, if you have room to drink then props to you.  The food is in great abundance!So we began with the the salad bar.  It's recommended not to fill up here but I honestly can't consume that much meat.  So I sampled most of the items at the salad bar.  The asparagus risotto was creamy and delicious.  All the sushi was fresh.  The Caesar salad dressing was creamy and flavorful.  The mozzarella could have used some basil with it, but was still good.On to the meat.  Service was phenomenal! We got to the point where we all were flipped to red and the waiter actually flipped us back to green to try the meat he had.  I'm glad he did.  It looked liked ribs but was one of my favorites.  The prime rib was also delicious.  Another favorite of mine was the bacon wrapped filet mignon.The desserts?  Eh, skip it.  I got the chocolate cake which I didn't like.  My boyfriend had the caramel cake, which was much better.Each of us cost $120 with one drink, unlimited meat and salad bar and dessert/coffee.  It's definitely a great spot to double date and/or bring out of towners.",7,5,6,Chrissy H.,"Manhattan, NY",135,399,1291

Salad bar has a lot of great options (including sushi), but I kept my eyes on the prize and got very little servings. The meat selection was great - nearly every type we tried was juicy and bursting with flavor! Definitely try to pace yourself because it's very easy to get full fast. I had to take quite a few breaks before turning my token to the green side.At the end, some of the waiters came by to sing my boyfriend happy birthday and even gave us dessert - always a plus point in my book! It's a little pricy if you go for weekend dinner - salad bar and unlimited meat selection puts you at a whopping $65 pp. But I think it's reasonable if it's for unlimited portions of good quality food - if you really want to get the most bang for your buck, make sure you come in with a strategy.",6,1,2,Tashnuva E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",273,551,126

They took our drink orders quickly but were not attentive to whether we needed refills or not.The worst part was at the end and is the reason I had to bump them down to a 2 star.

The waiters are scary quick once they see green, offering different meats every few minutes. I was kind of disappointed in the selection, as I thought there were going to be more options of meats. If you eat everything, than I recommend not even wasting room in your stomach on turkey and chicken. The bacon wrapped fillet and Plataforma sirloin were the best IMO, along with the rack of lamb.

Only the concept of when we get served and when they stop serving us, I thought that was cool.

1.0,1/28/2016,";tldr version: Fogo de chao was way better.. In terms of everything: Cheese bread, atmosphere, variety of meat, salad bar, and wine selection.Also, be aware that Churrascaria Plataforma does not do restaurant week dinner.Full version:After having had an amazing experience at Fogo de Chao last year during restaurant week, I decided to host my birthday dinner at Churrascaria Plataforma. I mean, it couldn't go wrong! What's not to love about an endless meat buffet with a no-frills bill since everything is flat rate? So I called to make an reservation, specifically saying ""6 people for restaurant week dinner"" and booked the table. My friends and I arrive at the restaurant and go about dinner. We were seated and then a waiter came to ask if we were familiar with the style and asked us about drinks. We opted not to order a bottle, since the wines averaged around $100. Not worth it! Throughout the dinner, my friends and I continue to compare this dinner to last year's experience and all decide the food was good, but not mind-blowing like last year's. (My friend literally wouldn't stop eating the cheese bread at Fogo last year.) After we all stuffed enough meat down our throats to the point of almost-explosion, the dessert cart rolls around and they were kind enough to have me pick one and brought it out with a sparkler for my birthday. It was very sweet of them, and the coconut flan was great.Now comes the part that ruined everyone's mood.. The bill. Instead of the $38 restaurant week rate we were expecting, we were charged ~$70 per person. When we called the manager over to discuss the bill, he said that they only do RW for lunch and that it ends at 3pm. When I told him that the hostess did not inform me at the time when I made the reservation, he immediately defended her by saying that she's very professional and that she wouldn't have made a mistake like that. We sat in silence. He said sorry, and left. We ended up paying the whole bill and my friends insisted on tipping 15%.I understand that miscommunications happen, but for a restaurant manager to not even acknowledge the possibility that his staff may have made a mistake and not shown ANY customer service accommodation to make up for us paying almost double the price everyone expected to is just unprofessional. Here's my story of how Churrascaria Plataforma did the opposite of ""making my day"". I sincerely hope everyone who chooses to go to them to never experience what I experienced. I won't let them ruin my perception of Brazilian Steakhouses (because they're amazing) but my entire party and I will NEVER return.",7,0,0,Chien L.,"New York, NY",74,41,15
5.0,1/28/2016,"Amazing spot! I took my boyfriend here for his 28th birthday on the 24th. It was a surprise spot. We had a great time. The food was overwhelmingly good! The staff were very fun, friendly, and courteous. Upon arriving the manager of the staff took my coat off for me and placed it down on my seat for me while one of the other staff pulled out my boyfriends seat for him. The way the staff were dressed in nice suits was very impressive and classy. I loved it. My kind of environment to dine in. Everywhere was clean, the place wasn't loud, rowdy, or overcrowded. There's a nice dim lighting to the place, and the setting of the dinner tables are lovely. The bread bites they start you out with are so soft, chewy, and delicious on the inside. No butter even needed. The variety of meat was superb! I couldn't even finish my plate. Everything was well seasoned, aside from some meats that were too well-done for my taste. Even my bf who is capable of eating a lot became full and satisfied after a point. He told me that I made a great choice for a birthday dinner spot for him. I'm glad I decided to take him here instead of to Del Frisco's. Del Frisco's isn't so bad, but I feel like with the Brazilian Steakhouse you get more bang for your buck since you get to taste a variety of meats as opposed to just ordering one type of meat or meal. The fixed prices at the Brazilian Steakhouse also gives you more of a secured spending feeling. Overall for the price, it was $60 per person. With the sweet bananas we ordered and two glasses of wine everything came out to $163 (less food at Del Frisco's would cost more than the $163), which was surprisingly low and great for me (since I was doing the treating). Since they were such wonderful hosts we decided to tip them $35 (around 20%).",3,0,0,Temi A.,"Bronx, NY",89,5,1

1.0,1/23/2016,"Supposedly ""$$$$"" they should change that thought after my review. Went to this place for restaurant week for lunch. Decor was nice and inside the restaurant there was a big open space with a salad bar in the middle, however decor doesn't make up for the experience. I have been to plenty of restaurants where more ""$$$$"" signs come with expectations, of a great service and food. HOWEVER, ""$"" or ""$$"" that I have been to have had ten times better service and food than this place. We were seated immediately which wasn't the issue, but the service was terrible. For an all you eat meat place we were probably served about 2-3 times within 20-30 minutes. I am totally unsure why but maybe my friend and I weren't dressed up in suits and looked like we were made of money so they totally neglected us as if we weren't going to pay and about to do a dine and dash. I had to ask for them to bring the stick of meat as they were leaving to go to the back of the house after serving the rest of the restaurant and leaving us. There were only 10 tables seated and many of them have already finished eating unlike us. This place was totally displeasing in both service and food; meat was mediocre and didn't come out warm but room temperaure to cold so most likely it was dying at the pass or they were struggling to keep up with pace of consumption and for dessert I had ""passionfruit mousse"" which didn't settle so the consistency tasted like an over sweetened yogurt. If anything the salad bar was the best part of the meal. If your looking into this place don't bother. I hope dinner is better for whom ever decides to go.

5.0,1/23/2016,"Certainly if you are of the carnivorous type this is the restaurant for you, but even if you prefer fish and salads don't hesitate to join the party at this very upscale Brazilian rodizio.  I'll start with the meat, with the best being the sirloin, parmesan steak, beef ribs, and chicken on the bone.  Ironically the big disappointments were the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the bacon wrapped turkey.  Bacon should make everything better, but these two meats were just too dry for the bacon to make a difference.  In any event, make sure you ask for horseradish, as that really brought out the flavor, especially with the beef.  As a nice change of pace, the salad bar is overflowing with delectable such as smoked salmon with capers, scalloped potatoes with ham, sushi, and an asparagus risotto that was amazing.  If prepared seafood dishes are your preference, you can have grilled salmon with a lemon caper sauce, shrimp in a lemon butter sauce, or both as we did!  Lastly, don't skimp on the side dishes. The fried polenta and rice and black beans were equally delicious.  Top it all off with a strawberry caipirinha and it was an overall fantastic dining experience. Everything except drinks and desert are included.  Note that there are fresh caipirinhas prepared at your table so you may want to wait for that rather than to order off the menu.  The apple taffy mints at the end were yummy too.",0,0,0,Gwendolyn P.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,730,113
1.0,1/21/2016,"In 3 words: A tourist trap.I think that if a restaurant - any restaurant, fancy or not - decides to volunteer its participation to an event such as Restaurant Week, it should accept the responsibility to deliver food up to the level of its standards. If a restaurant does it just to attract tourists and expects them to open their wallets for cheap food, that doesn't go well with me. Actually, that pisses me off. I'm not a freaking tourist.This is what Churrascaria Plataforma did a couple of days ago when I sat at one of their fancy tables. I didn't make my way to their establishment for their salad bar. I went for the meat. However, the ""steak"" they delivered was laughable, and inconsistent. Sure, you can have as much as you wish, but the quality of the meat they served was so low I couldn't go past the first couple of pieces. Some parts were tough, others were so chewy the knife could barely cut through them. The flavor was absent, the texture was embarrassing. I ended up eating from the options of the salad bar, and left most of the meat on my dish. In the meantime, loads of tourists were strolling around me, like bees gone crazy. They all looked like kids in a candy store. ""OMG!! It's all-u-can-eat!!!"" Eek... you can keep it.If Churrascaria Platform were a decent business, they would have limited the number of steaks on the restaurant week price fix menu to one per person, and would have kept the quality high. Instead, they preferred to circulate mediocre meat around their tables, confident that their foreigner customers would leave their restaurant happy.

2.0,1/20/2016,"I came here on MLK day for lunch on the first day of Restaurant Week.The beginning of this meal was definitely the best part. They pass around these doughy cheese balls. Almost like cheese filled cream puffs but the cheese is chewy and light. They're amazing. But the meal just went down hill from there. For RW they were doing a deal where it was unlimited salad bar which included Brazilian sausage, mini pork loins, baked chicken, and then they passed around some like top sirloins I think. This was not what we were told before the meal. They represented it as a much more inclusive meal with a full selection of cuts. The salad bar was good. Had some items I really like such as dolma and cherry peppers and many veggies (beets, olives, baby corn, etc) and salads (tabouleh, quinoa, pasta, etc). The Brazilian sausage was my favorite. They were those little like 2 inch guys that are smokey and juicy. They were the kind you would find just about anywhere, which was probably why I liked them, you cant really go wrong with standard pork sausages. The pork loins were ok, also like 2 inches with a little bone, tender but a tad dry. I think they call them pork wings or something in reality. Kind of like a pork lollipop. The chicken was painfully dry. Like hard to swallow dry. It was bad. The sirloin was another issue. At first the manager/waiter told us we would each only get one serving. What??? One serving? This is a steakhouse that features all you can eat meats! Absurd. However the guy passing around steak was a homie, and he came back to refill us after a while. That being said, the meat was chewy and kind of over cooked. With some chimichuri (which we had to request) it was edible but definitely nothing at all notable. Plus that sirloin was the only slice of beef I had all meal.  Some people at our table also ordered capirinas. They were like $14 and came back in the smallest rocks glass I've ever seen. I know we're in the city, and drinks are small, i drink in this city all the time, but these things were absolutely pathetic for a $14 price tag. Morale of the story, I thought the RW offerings were a sham. Its a shame cuz I wanted to get the full experience at this place and definitely return for dinner during a non-RW time. I wasnt expecting the whole shebang but at least a few cuts of meat. But their offerings were so slim that it just wasn't what I was looking for. If i wanted some overcooked sirloin and a salad bar I could have gone down the street and paid $15 for a flank steak and cooked it on my stove and made a side salad. They also had dessert options of passionfruit mousse, flan, and choco pudding. All were very very average, if that. The service was good. The place was nice. I like how they had it set up. They even had a cool like lounge area outside the bathroom. And what looked like a really nice bar area and live music stage in the dining area. But the offerings and the quality of food just didn't live up to the rest of it. I hope that churascaria plataforma expands their offerings for RW next year so that people can get a real taste of the standard menu and become long term customers.

1.0,1/19/2016,"I went for restaurant week and the menu was very misleading, since no proper steak was served. It was basically a big downgrade for the regular menu.I would agree if I haven't checked before going, but when I was called to confirm my reservation I asked if the restaurant week menu was the same that they offer regularly and if we will be able to have all the great cuts of meet and they confirmed that yes, we will.We got there and they told us that was not the case and that for 25 dollars we can have the salad bar (regular priced at 25,95). We went there to eat stake, so we had the full menu at regular price and they haven't gave any discounts or complementary treat for the miscommunication.After we left I called to provide feedback and I was told that was my mistake because of not checking the menu (even though I spoke with a representative, for them that doesn't count). They mentioned also they will call me back and never did.Good to see other people sharing same feedback on how misleading this people are on restaurant week.

1.0,1/18/2016,"Experience is based on a Restaurant Week Lunch.Waiting time for our table to get set up was short. We got seated near the salad bar and a manager, Angel, comes to 'explain' the Restaurant Week menu. Plus he mentions drinks aren't included (ie: tea, coffee).The RW lunch menu ""features"" top round steak*, pork sausage (chorizo?), pork loin, chicken, sides of french fries, white rice, beans, and open salad bar. Pork sausages, pork loin, and chicken are at the salad bar on one end, other other has the french fries, white rice, and beans. The steak needed to be selected from waiters bringing a plate of them around.Well, at a churrascaria, got to have meat! Got the medium steak, it was okay, nothing with a wow factor in either taste or size. Pork sausage was the most flavorful and plump of the bunch. Chicken was meh. Pork loin was way overcooked, tough and dry.Salad bar has the usual, grilled veggies, tomatoes, cucumber, salad components, dressings, but no fruit. So be it, a salad bar after all.Now, back to getting more steak! (see the asterisk on the second sentence next to steak? well, here we go.) We see the waiter walking to and from, not coming to us. Asked our busboy, Jorge**, to help bring a waiter to us. A few minutes later, the same manager, Angel, comes and explains to us we each get one steak for lunch, the other meats are all-you-can-eat. Yes, one steak, single and at whatever size you are given. One person in our party got a business card sized one and that's it for lunch.If the goal was to have a 90:10 ratio of veggies to meat for lunch, this restaurant, much less a churrascaria, would not have even been thought of. It's absurd to not even mention this at the beginning of our meal.Coming to the end of our meal, one person was still eating, but plates in general we being cleared and a senior waiter in black uniform comes over to ask us what we would like for dessert. Really? The entire party hasn't finished eating, causing me to request a few minutes to look at the heinous menu. Now the waiter doesn't step far, he waits by the salad bar (and near us) for our dessert orders. Soon, we placed them and at arrival, the plates aren't handed to each individual but handed to the nearest person to finish the hand-over chain when there was plenty of space to move around to place down the plates.

Since you took your time to come to a Brazilian steakhouse you expect more and end of paying full price to get some type of close to Brazilian experience.

1.0,1/18/2016,"Reservations for restaurant week just started here in NY, and so I was very excited to come here for lunch with my family due to the high ratings and reviews on here. Last year I went to Fugo De Chao and had a wonderful experience, so I had great expectations for this Brazilian steakhouse..... But this was very disappointing...Mind you, before I even started my meal, as I was walking around the salad bar I saw and overheard one of the customers walk up to the manager and tell him, ""I just wanted to let you know that my family and I came here last year for restaurant week and had a much better experience.."" So everything that followed did not come as a huge surprise, but was still upsetting...Food: unlimited salad bar - but who makes reservations at a steakhouse for the salads? Meats were not fresh cuts and there was a VERY limited + cheap variety. (As seen on menu) Meats were: Top round steak (over cooked and not much flavor), pork sausage (tasted like basic street cart sausage skewers), chicken (nothing special) , and pork loin with w/Parmesan (very dry). All the meats were just at the buffet stand except the top round steak, which someone would walk around to serve you ONE cut. Literally ONE. If you look at the menu, no where does it state that each person would get only 1 piece. How did we find out? Halfway through our time there we were frustrated as to why the steak was not offered to our table again, and so we asked one the of waiters. One of the managers then came up to tell us that each person only gets 1 piece. The steak wasn't great, but it would have been nice to still have it as an option at a BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE. Then the desserts were not so great either. The flan was stiff and not the smooth consistency that it should be. The chocolate mousse and the passion fruit mousse was more of an artificial pudding. Service: Not very welcoming from the beginning. The manager that brought us to the table just asked, ""here for restaurant week?"" and then went on the explain how everything worked. Not even a hello or how is everyone doing?... Not much service throughout our time there. When it came time for dessert, the waiters showed their lack of service as well by basically tossing the plates of dessert on the table. A very disappointing experience. Restaurant week is suppose to allow people to see what these 5 star restaurants are all about, and today certainly did not feel like a 5 star dining experience from food to service.

5.0,12/26/2015,"I'm a vegetarian giving a 5 star review to a brazilian steakhouse, so it must be good...Basic premise is that there is a salad bar, small menu of side orders, and a red/green card that serves as the stop/go sign for the meat brought to your table.  No main menus. Since I am a vegetarian, I ate sides from the salad bar and french fries/cheesy bread. You could easily fill up on the salad bar, so my advice is to take it easy. Once you are seated a parade of servers will come around with a bunch of slabs of meat on spikes from which they will cut you a slice if you'd like. The 5 guests I came with all said the meat was excellent. Particular favorites were the chicken hearts and the lamb wrapped in bacon. The interior is beautiful and elegant. We did not have to wait for a table and all the servers were very nice. Almost all of them are Brazilian and speak fluent english and brazilian portuguese. They also have great drinks. I would recommend either the regular caipirinha or wine caipirinha.",7,1,4,Carolyn K.,"Queens, NY",215,162,278
5.0,12/25/2015,"I love this place. I took my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday tonight and it was wonderful. The service and food was excellent. They treated us as we were family. They were very friendly and funny. Is not cheap but the price is worth it you can eat until you die lol they give you a round paper with two sides one color red for the salad bar which has a tremendous amount of things you can select from even fish, shrimp and sushi, pasta and rice, don't eat too much of that beacuse you won't have space for the meats. Once you're done with the salad bar simple turned the round paper to the green side so the servers can come to your table and offer you all the meats. If you need a break simply turned it to the red side and they will stop coming. They sang happy birthday to him and give him a free piece of delicious strawberry cheesecake, courtesy of the house.

When we realized that we were going to be late, we called the restaurant to let them know. During that call we were told it was no problem there would be a table for us.We get there twenty minutes late, which was about the time we told them we would be there. They gave up our table. The hostess attempted to make it right by giving us the next available table, but the manager decided that because we were late, even though we called it was to bad so sad.

5.0,12/17/2015,"Yes, yes, YES! Plataforma is an awesome place if you enjoy indulging in endless high quality meats. My boyfriend took me here last year around Christmas time. We came again this past week and I was once again highly impressed with the entire experience. First of all, the atmosphere is just awesome! It's sleek, clean, and classy. Not over done but just right. Also since we came during holiday season there were some very elegant decorations up. On our most recent visit we had a 4:45 reservation. When we arrived we were kindly greeted and seated right away. Service is consistently attentive, knowledgable, and professional. Due to the fact that they were still transitioning into dinner the salad bar wasn't quite ready but we ordered 2 caipirinhas and started deciding which sides we wanted to order to go along with our meats. We decided on fried plantains and white rice. Our server brought over some delicious cheese bread which I totally could have filled up on. We were eventually informed that the salad bar was ready. On your 1st visit to Plataforma you must PACE yourself. Don't fill up on the wonderful salad bar options. Options range from sushi, various types of pasta, crab, stuffed grape leaves, and other general salad fixings. After enjoying our appetizers it was time to flip our cards over to ""green"". Once the card is on green the meat rolls in....leg of lamb, lamb chops, prime rib, beef ribs, garlic steak, filet mignon, turkey wrapped in bacon, pork tenderloin, Plataforma steak and the list goes on. I literally can't even remember all the different types of meats but O man the leg of lamb was my favorite! During our meal we ordered 2 glasses of Chardonnay and finished with the Carmel flan. The final damage was a little over $200.

5.0,12/16/2015,"I was here years ago, on a double date for dinner and it was pretty good but now it has gotten even better as I think they added more meat cuts to the menu.  This time, we came with a group of 13 people, a department outing for year-end.  We arrived at 4 PM, were seated immediately as we had reservations and started with the salad bar.  I knew not to load on it so I just grabbed a few pieces to tie me over.  The sushi and the shrimp portion of the bar for dinner is served later, around 5 PM, so we had to wait for that, but not a problem because by that time, the meat has started making rounds.  The service was top-notch, the meat was literally non-stop and they remembered the doneness of the meat one liked.  The drinks were delicious, btw, you can ad flavors to the caipirinha, it's not advertised on the menu, but you can have strawberry, passion fruit, etc, you can also request that they make it caipirosca, that is, with vodka instead of the cachaca rum, some people at our table preferred that.  I should not have had the dessert, but everyone at the table did and I could not say no-I should have, or, at leas, chosen something lighter than the crème Brule which totally did me in, I literally could not move.  I think I won't be eating meat for the remainder of the year.  This is an excellent place for a group dining, we had a delicious feast that came to $100 per person with drinks and dessert.",0,0,0,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,698,0

3.0,12/2/2015,"Came here for dinner, which was $62 and doesnt include dessert/drinks. We had 16 meats, grilled cheese, and garlic bread. I think only 3 of them were truly enjoyable to eat, and the rest tasted average. There wasnt really any sauce to go along with it so it was often kinda dry. If it wasnt flavorless/dry it would be over salted lol. Yeah so only 3 i would say i liked - garlic steak, the plataforma steak, and something else. You first start at the salad bar, which also has sushi. It was pretty standard. Then next the fun part begins where you get to try unlimited amnts of meat! You can also choose among 8 side dishes (all of them if you want). The mashed potatoes were bland tasting and so was the boiled broccoli. The servers serving the meat were very nice, always on top of bring us more meat to the point where i flipped my card over several times (meaning no more meat to come). Oh and a few of the more awkward things: in the restroom there was this guy and a tip jar blocking the paper towels, and i dont rlly wansna tip to dry my hands. AND theres this Desert Lady whos pushing the dessert cart around all night. Right when you finish she'll come up to you and persuade you to get dessert, but i dont rlly want it if its not included in this expensive meal and its been wheeled throughout the whole restaurant all nightOverall, good service, nice atmosphere, mediocre food.

Boy, was I wrong...The bread they start you off with is pretty good. There's a salad bar there with all kinds of things. I skipped it but everyone at the table enjoyed it. Then we all turned our cards over to the green side. They brought meat after meat after meat after meat!!!!! Out of the 8 or more different meats I tried, my favorites were the chicken, the garlic steak, the bacon wrapped turkey and the Parmesan filet mignon! I had never eaten that much at a restaurant in my life! I was sooooo stuffed and still managed to squeeze in some chocolate mousse cake for dessert which was so damn good. The staff was super friendly. There is a parking lot across the street. I know, parking in Manhattan can be a bit pricey but once your parking gets validated by the restaurant, it is only $12 for up to 5 hours. Can't go wrong with that at all.

1.0,11/19/2015,"Interesting this place. It was almost full up and it's a big space so I had high hopes. You never expect too much of the salad bar in a churrascaria given the meat is the main reason to visit. As expected, the salad bar was a non-event. Uninteresting salads, tasteless cheeses and no dressings other than cheap balsamic and olive oil.So onto the meat. The chicken leg and pork sausage skewer came around the most, probably at a ratio of 3:1 to other meats. Parmesan coated pork loin came once, later on when most people would be getting full the sirloin, garlic, sirloin, and prime rib came round. Flank steak also was a more frequent visitor given it's low cost.The problem with the meat was two fold:1. Not very good quality animals to start with. The beef was certainly not a high quality breed like Angus. The only beef that was worth eating was the prime rib, that was good.2. Lack of flavour. None of the meat had been seasoned when cooked so although nicely medium rare, it just lacked flavour.The sides were atrocious. Fries out of a frozen bag purchased from a food wholesaler. Cutting your own potatoes and producing a good French fry is something even standard burger chains get right. Black beans were a soupy tasteless mess, and the vinaigrette was just chopped tomato and onion in a watery liquid.In a bid to find flavour, I asked for some chimichurra. Even that was tasteless! Chopped green herbs with no flavour, not even a little vinegar to give it some edge.This place is all about the profit margin. Cheap meat, cheap salad bar, poor sides, lots of people paying $100/head...it will make money as long as visitors/tourists/business people in town for a quick trip keep coming.It's really not worth the money or your time. There are far better restaurants around for half the money.I will say the wait staff were very attentive and friendly.",0,0,0,James P.,"London, United Kingdom",0,6,0

One waiter even came back around to my fiance more than once knowing she loved what he was serving. Everything is well prepared, fresh off the grill our out of the oven seasoned to perfection. Didn't hit the salad bar because I was glued to my chair from all the food. Only downside (or plus side) is that the people who give you your bill are a bit slow.

1.0,11/2/2015,"I am amazed by these other reviews. I am curious if I just came on an off night or if these other guests haven't been to another Brazilian steakhouse before...I stopped by with a couple of coworkers based on the reviews on Yelp. From the reviews, I expected the experience to be outstanding, but unfortunately I am left very underwhelmed. The service was outstanding, I will admit but the food did not live up to the hype.The cheese bread was hard and cold. None of the typically fluffy bread here. Even when my coworker complained, it failed to come out any better. The salad bar was big, but was not fresh. Fresh mozzarella was very dry and lacked flavor as did the tomatoes served with it. I did not try the sushi, but it did not look very appetizing. Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, and a number of other similar steakhouses' salad bars absolutely blow Plataforma's out of the water.After a disappointing salad bar, I was excited for the meat to come, but unfortunately it was just as mediocre. The meat was under flavored and over cooked. Most of the items were incredibly chewy as well. The bananas are deep fried and are incredibly bland. I would say that these are typically one of my favorite parts of a Brazilian steak house meal, but here we struggled to even finish half of a serving. There are also no free refills on sodas. That doesn't bother me that much usually, but at this price, it's just another reason to avoid Plataforma. In a city with food as great as New York, there is no reason to be wasting your calories or money on Plataforma.

I recommend saving room for the meats and sides. They also have an alcohol cart that goes around. You select the fruit that you want and it gets mashed and mixed in with Brazilian rum. Pretty strong and they're not shy with the liquor. Let's get down to the meats now. The garlic steak is AMAZING. The filet mignon is AMAZING. In fact, out of 5 of the different meats that I tried, maybe one of them was okay. Just okay. Service was AMAZING.

I originally planned to go to Texas de Brazil but last minute decided to take my friend out for his birthday to someplace we both had not tried and after reading all these reviews i thought this place seemed perfect and now i really wish i went to Texas de brazil. First off the meat was really good...the garlic steak was to die for but a lot of the meat was salty. The salad bar was diverse but mehhhhh Texas de Brazil definitely tops them when it comes to the salad bar. NOW the service was HORRIBLE. i have never been to a restaurant where i had NO IDEA who my waiter was. Someone sat us down at the table asked us what drinks we would like but NEVER offered or gave us the wine menu. I literally had to stop a random server to get a wine menu and by the time i finally got one i was already so full from the meat. I mean what kind of place does not offer wine the wine menu? I even had to stop some of the men serving the meat that would walk right past our table before offering us meat even though the green side of the card was up. so let me break it down for you guys....service does matter... i felt so rushed and the ambiance of people just rushing all around you just takes back from the experience.

5.0,9/1/2015,"This is by far one of the best Brazilian steakhouses  I've been to. The dining area is very large and aesthetically pleasing. The atmosphere is fine dining  and the waitstaff are appropriately dressed as such. I must say that the waitstaff will embrace you like an old friend and treat you like you're the most important person in the establishment.The procedure here is typical of a Brazilian steakhouse. Once we were seated, we filled out a slip of paper indicating our side dishes and preferences. From there, we proceeded to the salad bar.The first thing I noticed was that the salad bar was extremely fresh and all the items that were put out were  top shelf. The sushi at the salad bar was high quality, not just California rolls. The romaine, kale, and  spring mix were all exceptionally fresh. This place has servers that are standing right behind you at the salad bar and as soon as you take some of an item they are right there to replace it with a fresh item.In standard Brazilian steakhouse fashion, we returned to our seats and began eating the food we got the salad bar. By then it was time to turn the little paper disc from the red side to the green side to indicate to the waiter that we were ready for the meat to come. As the parade of servers kept coming to the table, each new piece of meat that was brought up was more exceptional than the previous. All of the meats were melt in  your mouth delicious!!The Caipirinhas were delicious and the desert selections were out of this world. I had the coconut flan, which was literally the best flan I have ever had. For two people who had dinner, drinks and dessert, the bill was about $165 without the tip.I cannot think of many restaurants that are worth that price but this is certainly one of them.In summary, the decor was outstanding, the food was to die for, the service was unparalleled, and I cannot wait to bring my friends and family to this wonderful restaurant.",0,0,0,David F.,"West Palm Beach, FL",37,9,1

I came here for lunch during restaurant week a few weeks ago so there was a limited amount of meat options which doesn't bother me (sometimes less is better). My grip with this place is that the meat I was constantly served was not seasoned at all and it's a different flavor altogether when you season the meat after it's cooked and sliced.

Warning, yelpers are absolutely right, try not to fill up on the salad bar. I am still dreaming of some of the side salads and rice dishes. Once you are ready, you give all of your side order choices.  We selected the fried bananas, polenta, veggie of the day and the yucca flour and vinaigrette to flavor the meats.  They came around with all sorts of meats all were absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked.

The salad bar is well-stocked and offers a variety of veggie and sides, but I didn't make a full use of it because I wanted to save space in my stomach for the actual steak. As for the steak, some cuts were definitely delicious (especially the prime rib and garlic steak), but the rest were rather mediocre. They didn't taste like particularly high-quality meat and some cuts were rather dry and tasteless. Another complaint I have is that the whole place reeks of raw meat smell! Yes, I understand I'm at a steakhouse where people are constantly walking around with big chunks of meat, but they really should improve the ventilation.

Variety of meats were limited, the same things kept coming back and we got super bored of the food after 10 minutes of eating- salad bar was ok I've had waaaay better, nothing special there either except they have a mini sushi section- chicken was super dry and not enjoyable to eat at allOverall, for $63 per person.... It's really really not worth it. You might as well make it yourself at home. As a meat lover... I was super disappointed in the quality of meat this restaurant served and was a bit embarrassed to bring my boyfriend and his family here. Basically by the end of the dinner, everyone was stuffed but dissatisfied with the food.

You are given a coaster like card which is red on one side and green on the other. We ignored the salad bar and flipped out cards over to green almost immediately upon being seated. When your card is on the green side, the meat cutters will constantly walk over offering you their various types of fresh cut chicken, beef, pork and lamb. My personal favorites were the filet mignon wrapped with bacon, the lombo ( pork loin), costela ( pork ribs) and sausage. They were all juicy and succulent , full of flavor. Some cuts were not as good and I felt bad not finishing them. The meat cutters were very professional and patient, feel free to ask them about the meat and request specific cuts as you like.We told the waiter that it was our friend's birthday and they bought out 2 cakes lighted with candles on the house !

The Turkey was a bit dry when it came to the Turkey Parmesan, but everything else was very well seasoned, not overpowering and there's also a salad bar to go along with the red meat if you want a bit of greens or sushi even if you don't want to see just red meat on your plate.

The waiters were so friendly and cracking jokes about having one more bite. Everything was truly amazing !

And it was on the house ! I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience! It was honestly the best dining experience I've ever had! I encourage you all to come give this place a try !

5.0,5/27/2015,"I rarely eat beef (I only like it in ground form, like burgers) but holy cow (no pun intended), Brazilian BBQ always wins.I'd made reservations for dinner at a different place in Midtown before our Avenue Q show (which, btw, THE BOMB), but then once I realized it was like a 10-block walk, which i didn't want to make in my not-so-comfy-but-super-cute shoes, I canceled that res and delegated the task of finding a new restaurant to my husband.He ended up picking Churrascaria Plataforma, which was only a few blocks away from the theater, and I'm surprised he got us a reservation since it was Mother's Day.I was totally not disappointed.  I didn't eat many of the sides from the buffet, but they had lots of choices from cured meats to salads.  I did order the fried bananas from this menu they give you (they're also side orders, but not available at the buffet), and they were so good our waiter talked me into getting another order, which I polished off by myself.Meats are excellent quality and taste, but if you don't want anything too salty, ask for a piece from the middle, otherwise the salt-crusted sides will have you choking down water.We deemed this place much better than Espetus Churrascaria in SF, which is already pretty amazing, and the price wasn't as high as we thought it would be (on-par with Espetus), given its location and the quality of food.Great place if you want to carnivore yourself out, with or without a show to catch!",3,2,3,Tori S.,"Orange County, CA",1407,1154,503

3.0,5/21/2015,"Being that this was my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse, I was super excited to try all the various meats and buffet options at the salad bar. I had a reservation and was seated within five minutes of arriving. Immediately, we went to the salad bar and there was a wide variety of food ranging from sushi to mozzarella and tomato salad. At first, the service was amazing and everyone was very attentive. However, once we sat down for the meat, the servers skipped us on numerous occasions. They appeared to be a bit biased about which tables they wanted to serve. I had my paper disc on green the entire time, but there were many instances where no meat was being served. At one point, over 30 minutes passed without any meat. Many of the servers just skipped our table and only until I stared down a server did he stop to serve the meat. It was only after we complained to a server that they finally started coming to our table. Also, I was disappointed that we were unable to try more than half of the meats listed on the website. Maybe they served the meat to others, but just skipped our table? Who knows. When we were still in the middle of eating, they started cleaning the table and taking away empty plates and utensils without even asking. It wasn't even closing time yet, there was a good hour before closing. I'm not sure how the service is at earlier, but don't plan on staying past 9PM on days they close at 11PM unless you'd like to be ignored. Although the customer service was completely unacceptable towards the end, both the meat and salad bar were pretty good. This only gets three stars because it is worth it for the extensive amount of food. Had it been based on the service, only 1 star would be allotted.For those who need parking, park at icon for $12. Don't park at the lot next door, unless you want to pay $55 for a measly 2 hours.",1,0,0,Deborah Z.,"New York, NY",0,15,1

5.0,5/14/2015,"Came the day before Mother's day with my sister and two friends. Honestly, they deserve to have the rating bumped to a 5! Do NOT come here if: 1.)You are going to bitch about the price (about $70/pp during dinner).2.) You are going to bitch about all of the meat coming out. Why come to begin with? 3.) You are going to bitch about the salad bar or sides. Granted, they are included in the meal but you come for meat. End of storyDo come here:1.) If you want to have an Atkins approved meal w/endless variety of meats; including different cuts of steak, lamb, chicken,& turkey-prepared at whatever temp you tell your server.2.) If you want excellent service from everyone around3.) Want to dine at a place that is not only delicous in food but pretty in decor as well4.) If you want to impress your carnivore family, friend, or boo5.) If you want to be rolled out of this joint after your meal from being extremely satisfied.I don't get some of the negatives ppl commented on here whatsoever. DOn't you ppl look prices up before you go to a place OR see what the place is about? Smh. Anyway, the service here is out of this world! Dishes were taken away promptly, waiters came out w/ the temp steak we requested in a timely manner, maitre D came over several times to check on us and asked if he could tell the chef for a particular favortie we wanted. Also, fried yuca isn't on the paper for sides but you can just write it on. Bangin'! Like someone else recc in a previous review, you can ask for salt if you need more flavor on your steak but I didn't need it. I was fine w/the sides because I felt the steak was seasoned well and didn't want to many over powering flavors. Get the sangria too- another bangin' option!

4.0,5/12/2015,"TL;DR - High quality meats, well cooked.  Service was a bit slow.As Brazilian Churrascaria goes Plataforma is quite good.  On arriving we were given a buzzer to let us know when the table would be ready.  Idea being that you would visit the bar in the meantime.  Fortunately for us the wait was not long, which is good considering that we had a reservation and came on time.The cold bar was interesting, and of a high class, but was somewhat lacking in variety.  I would not advise going here for that alone, although it is definitely easy to fill up at.Now the meats themselves as they were brought about were good.  The sirloin steak was my favorite, although the cheese covered filet mignon, and lamb were close seconds.They also make a very nice caipirinha's right by the table, although I do wish they increase the size of the drink somewhat given the price.The service was a bit slow, and the price a bit high for what you get, but overall it was an excellent dining experience and I would go back.",0,0,0,Jerry Z.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",12,75,3

3.0,5/6/2015,"This is the kind of meal that gets you stuffed for atleast 12 hours. I highly recommend going for lunch over dinner, otherwise you will fall into a deep coma afterward. Two words to describe this place is meat overload. For lunch, it's all you can eat for 40 bucks, tip and tax will bring you to $50.00 Having had fogo de chao, I would say the salad bar here has a bigger variety. However I ended up regretting it because the main course was too overwhelming. Whenever you're ready, flip your card over and the meats will never stop coming. They arrive hot and out the oven, ready to be cut in front of you. The selection of meats were mostly beef then the occasional lamb, turkey and chicken. My favorites were the garlic steak, filet mignon and platforma steak.Some of the meats I found too salty, the chicken was a bit dry. The steak options are definitely better than the other meats. I left feeling like my insides exploded and entered into a zombie mode for a good 8 hours. 12 hours after my meal, my body was still struggling to digest the food. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have a huge appetite or very good self control.For the atmosphere, food offering, I would say quality over quantity is preferred.

1.0,5/2/2015,"Wife and I were so excited to try this place on our NYC visit - especially after seeing it on the show 'best thing I ever ate'.  We had a 6pm reservation on Thursday and when we arrived our anticipation and excitement built.  The first meat arrived and it was the house sirloin - cooked to past well done and like leather.  We noticed the complete lack of seasoning was well.The next ribeye arrived and it was overcooked to medium-well also.  The theme of the night was overcooked meats which were very tough, low-quality and chewy.  We requested medium-rare many time and never really got anything medium rare.  The only edible cut of meat which was just ok was the garlic sirloin.  The service was not so great either.  At other Brazilian (like Fogo, Texas de Brazil, Chama Gaucha, Chima) the server makes sure the meats come out the right temperature.  The managers at other places always assure the same but here the manager was walking around but not really interacting with the guests - or us.We absolutely love Brazilian and have eaten at dozens of high-end Brazilian steakhoues.  This place failed on every aspect of the dining experience and we were most disappointed when we left.  We don't mind the $65 per head price but expect great quality and service in return.",3,1,2,Don L.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",456,214,20
5.0,5/2/2015,"One of the best restaurants I have ever been to, of course also one of the most expensive. However the food does justify the price as it's certainly of high quality. I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary and it was certainly worth it. The format is simple. The apps come from the all you could eat app bar. Tons of good stuff, sushi, bacon, shrimp, salad, solid selection of good food no limit all you can eat. Then comes the main course which is an all you can eat various Brazilian steak and meat gauntlet. The servers come right to your table and cut the meat right off and onto your plate. The main meal also includes a side dish. All the meats were so good and of very high quality. Some of the best steak, rib, and pork I have ever had. And they give it to you till you can't take no more. We also had dessert to top it off and it was very good as well. The service was good and the atmosphere was really awesome (The live piano band was a nice touch).My only complaints was that they would not let me take home my leftovers (I really only had half of a cut of meat cut up and half of another piece, it wasn't really like I loaded up my plate to get a bunch out) and they charged for refills of soda. I understood that the desserts and drinks were not included to the flat meal price but it just seemed very tacky and cheap to charge someone for a refill on a Coke when I was dropping nearly 200 dollars on a meal with tip. Outside of those two minor complaints I enjoyed my meal and it was a great place for a special occasion.

Their is about 10 sides to choose from, including french fries, friend polenta, spuds, vegetable of the day, rice, steak vinaigrette, beans.

5.0,2/19/2015,"tl;dr Guys... This place is fantastic. The service is amazing, the food is out of this world.-----I was here in a group of 8 - we'd called in a reservation for 5pm same day. We showed up a little early but were seated instantly, and the server promptly took our drink order.First, we attacked the salad bar - I opted for the grilled veggies, but the rest of it looked appetizing, as well. My coworkers raved about the sushi - who woulda thought??Then, the cards were flipped, and the madness began. Top sirloin, prime rib, bacon-wrapped lamb, Parmesan-crusted pork loin, spare ribs, flank steak, lamb chops, sausage... It was all incredible. Best meat I've had in years.Additionally, the family-style sides were amazing, as well - mashed potatoes, polenta, cheesy bread, steamed broccoli, and especially the fried plantains. Finger-licking good.We topped the dinner off with the selections from the dessert cart - though I was too full and preparing for meat sweats to even consider anything sugary.Overall, an amazing experience I would highly recommend.",4,0,3,Alena G.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,149,17

But my favorite is the luscious Alcatra(Prime Beef Hips ),it is very tender and juicy.

5.0,2/14/2015,"Don't bother wasting time at any steakhouse if you're craving any sort of meat. The only way to describe this place is ""meat heaven"". My husband came here for his bachelor party and hasn't stopped talking about it, so we decided to come last night and stay in the adjoining hotel. Perfect Valentine's treat for 2 carnivores.The salad bar has a lot of options to start with, but once you flip your card to green, the meat begins. It was a little overwhelming at first because people are constantly coming to your table. ""Flank steak?"" ""Garlic steak?"" ""Chicken or sausage?"" I had to flip the card to red just to catch up with everything on my plate. It was all delicious. Sometimes you'd get the outside slice of meat that touched the grill and it was just awesomely crisp and sea-salty. Everything I ate I would've happily eaten as an entree by itself anywhere else. Here, I ate garlic steak, flank steak, top sirloin, prime rib, Parmesan-encrusted filet mignon, bacon-wrapped filet mignon, pork rib, chicken, and sausage. Say ""yes"" to anything that comes out on a cart. The best things I ate were pieces from a gigantic beef rib they were rolling around and from a fresh roasted ham with pineapple sauce.The service here is also excellent. If your card is green, you're never lacking meat. After a little while, the servers remember what you like and dislike. The guy with the prime rib kept coming back to my husband because he knew he loved it. The maitre'd also asked us if we tried everything and made sure to send over what we hadn't eaten yet. Everyone working here is so pleasant.Other great notes were the fresh caipirinhas that were muddled and shaken right in front of us, the unlimited side dishes (the fried bananas were amazing), and the beautiful dessert cart. My husband loved his flan and I, a pastry chef who can be a little jaded when it comes to dessert, devoured the coconut caramel cake.Staying at the hotel is a great idea because I had eaten so much that I immediately fell asleep after the meal.",2,0,1,Kelly M.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,48,9

Plataforma is suposed to be really famous for their meats but I was shocked when I tried the Picanha (my favorite and best cut of meat for bbq) it had no flavor no salt nothing.

The place is big, and the bar has everything.Drinks were good but expensive.I guess it's because their location, but not worth almost $300 for 3 adults when only one of us asked for an alcoholic drink.Desserts were delectable!

4.0,1/18/2015,"Overall a good time. I ate there last night with a party of 28, so we had a very long table. I think that probably threw off their wait-staff, so  I'm letting a few things go that I would ordinarily be very upset about, given the very large size of our party. the $140 per head we paid (including tip) was a little high, but it was a fun time and worth the experience.Pros: The food was great. It's an immersive experience to have people come over to you with a slab of fresh meat to get a piece of on an as-wanted basis. The salad bar was decent. The wait staff overall was very nice. In the salad bar, I enjoyed the sushi and seafood the most. They had plenty of pieces of sushi as well as some smoked salmon to enjoy. They had several vegetable platters and I think two salad options.For the meat, they had a few different options. Turkey wrapped in bacon, and steak wrapped in bacon were both decent. All of the individual meats were very good. Various cuts of beef, and one choice of spare ribs. The sausage was a little too salty for my tastes, and the chicken was mushy. But, the meat more than made up for it.The live band was a nice touch, and the space is huge and can accommodate parties of any size.Cons:My biggest complaint was that they only served dessert to about 1/3 of the table. Maybe 10 out of 28 people got a piece of cake or other dessert. It looked delicious and I asked wait staff for it 3 times and was promised it would come around, but I watched as other tables got served and I never got mine. I felt like the guy in Office Space who never got his piece of cake when everyone else in the office did. Basically they served dessert to one side of our long table, but not to the side sitting across from them, regardless of repeated requests and assurances.Again though, our party was very large so I understand they're not used to it. Still, this would make me nervous about bringing a large party there, such as for a wedding or other event.They missed a few other things, like pouring wine and water for some of us - I had to pour my own wine. It was fine - we had bottles, but it felt a little weird to be one of those who did not get full service when others around me did.The other negative is a very tiny one. They have a system where you display a green card when you want food, and a red card when you need a break from all the meat. We didn't receive instructions on this so some newbies to the place took a while to get acclimated. Again though, this is a very tiny thing - it would have been better if they came to all sections of our table and explained the process to us in groups of 8-10. My guess is they probably told the head of the table, and nobody else.Overall, it was a great experience. Smaller groups would probably get the entire experience. Larger groups should go in with the expectation that they won't get full service, but still it's a very social atmosphere and there's plenty of space.",1,0,0,Dennis C.,"Hoboken, NJ",13,6,0
4.0,1/11/2015,"This was my first Brazilian Steakhouse trip, and I was impressed! I was a bit wary of an 'all you can eat meat' restaurant, questioning what the quality might be like, but it was awesome. They had decent enough bacon wrapped filets cooked medium rare that came around a few times. And everything was sent around equally...actually the filet and prime rib came around more than the sausage and chicken. I did not eat much of the salad bar, opting instead to wait for the main course. But one thing from the salad bar I did overly indulge in was the dinner rolls. They are small and DELICIOUS! They may be some sort of yeast roll, and they are awesome. I had to make a conscious effort not to fill up on them before the main course came around. Overall, this is a great place, but it should be noted that dessert and alcohol are NOT included in the prix fixe price. We did not have drinks or dessert and the total was about 150 pre tip. With everything, expect to spend well over $200 after tax and tip for 2 people.",1,0,0,Tracy T.,"Manhattan, NY",2,60,10

I never eat sides or salad bar first so I don't fill up on the heavy starches before eating the meat.  However, I still don't eat more than ten ounces of meat when you add it all up.  If I ate large quantities of meat and enjoyed eating that much meat, this would be a great restaurant.",3,0,1,Sara Z.,"Morristown, NJ",64,579,5

2.0,12/15/2014,"Too hyped up and very overpriced for what they give you. I have eaten rodizio many times in many different restaurants and this one is definitely not one I'd return to. The meat was very poorly seasoned; almost no salt and if you know Brazilian churrasco you know that they love to salt there meat, with very much reason as it brings out the amazing flavor of the meat. They have a great and wide selection of meats but that's if they ever serve them to you. There was an abundant amount of top sirloin(picanha) which I love but I also paid to eat all the other meats. We went at dinner so we didn't have and of the filet mignon, ribeye, pork loin, the Alcatra and if we hadn't asked for the short ribs 3 times and waited about 25 minutes for it we probably wouldn't have gotten that either. Oh and I even had to ask for the chicken legs and sausage, which is probably the cheapest thing on there, or I wouldn't have gotten that either. And don't be scared to leave your card on green as they will come 2 or 3 guys in the beginning real quick but after that, you'll be waiting on them. For the price, quality and decor, which I didn't think it was that special, I would take my money to fogo de chao which is not too far from there but you can get better rodizio for half the price in other places, trust me.",0,0,0,Danny F.,"Union, NJ",182,6,1

The service was slow and I had to ask several times to get drinks.  The salad bar looked sparse. The mead was not that good and even when you were green, the waiters seemed to be on their own agenda and they raised their prices so it is now super expensive.

They explained the double colored card with the green indicating to the staff that you want meat and red indicates that you do not any meat at that time.  We first started with the salad bar.  They had a great variety of foods there.  They had salad, sushi, and pasta. Everything had a great appeal to it and tasted wonderfully.  The best part of the meal was all the varieties of meat. There was Filet Mignon, lamb shanks, prime rib, lab chops, grilled chicken, and they even offered turkey for Thanksgiving which was greatly appreciated!!!  All the meats were very scrumptious and flavorful.  After having the whole round of meats, a staff came by and asked if there was any other meat we would like to try again.  Unfortunately, we had to decline his offer since we were completely full at the end.  However, after seeing the dessert cart, we had to try it, so we did.  As with the theme of this restaurant, they had a wide variety of desserts to choose from.  I had a pecan pie and it was very delicious!In the end, I am glad we had a chance to eat at this establishment and I highly recommend you to try this place out.  It is very comparable to Fogo de Chao but I believe the ambiance is much better here than Fogo de Chao.

4.0,11/24/2014,"We had a good meal here, but I couldn't help but continuously compare this restaurant to Fogo de Chao as both are similar, I've been to Fogo in Miami several times, and there's also a Fogo in Manhattan not far from this restaurant.IMO, Churrascaria Plataforma far outshines Fogo de Chao when it comes to the salad and food bar, and also the service.   Here at Churrascaria Plataforma, they have things like shrimp and sushi on the cold bar that I've not seen at Fogo, and some of their hot sides like their scalloped potatoes and lasagna are also superior IMO.  The service here was also very good!  When I returned to the food bar for a second helping, I was hoping to get more of one particular dish which had since been replaced by something else.  The attendant saw me and asked if I was looking for another item.  When I explained, she told me they had some of the dish I was craving back in the kitchen, and she quickly offered to go and get some for me.  I declined, but I was impressed that she was willing!  During our meal the manager stopped by to ask how we were doing, and as we were slowing down, he came and asked us twice if there were any particular meats we were hoping to still try before we finished.  When my friend told him that he was hoping for another lamb chop, a gaucho with a skewer of lamb chops was sent to our table in short order.  Again, impressive!In my opinion, some of the meats here weren't as flavorful, certainly not as salty, as those at Fogo.   Also, the sides they bring to the table such as the fried bananas and mashed potatoes simply aren't as good as the caramelized bananas and mash that Fogo offers.   This place is also a bit pricier than Fogo; We arrived at around 6 on a Saturday night and paid $63 each for dinner, $10 for a dessert that we shared, and $7 for a Coke, or about $78 each before gratuity when we split the bill.",13,2,5,Paul W.,"Miami, FL",933,1336,617

Walked in early at 6pm, no problem! They quickly sat us at a nice little table. I had to explain to my parents, Green means Go! Red means stop! You'll figure out what that means when you give this place a try. They have two options. The premium salad bar or Everything you can eat! This place is pricey, but the quality of the food is amazing. I can't even begin to describe how the meats taste. Reading it vs eating it would do it no justice.  If you're a wine drinker, their wine menu is huge! My bill came to $405 dollars for 4 people. That included 2 desserts, 4 drinks, half bottle of wine, 3 double espressos. The floor manager is always looking over you to ensure you're being served well.

The thin sliced bread sprinkled with cheese? Amazing! They also kept the meat coming and it was perfectly cooked. The only complaint I had was that much of the meat could have used more seasoning.

4.0,11/15/2014,"Went here because im a food lover, and I like all you can eat. The salad bar was good, but halfway through my first plate, I moved my lettuce and there was a spider in my food. We brought it to the attention of management who blamed it on new flowers that were just put up that day. That immediately put a bad taste in my mouth, as I did not want to eat anymore salad. Management was very nice about it, and ordered two drinks (4) total for me and my girlfriend. At their pricing that was about $50 in drinks. After not wanting anymore salad, we switched the meat portion of the meal. I must say, this made this four stars. If there wasn't a spider in my salad this would be a five star rating. The meat was very good. We like our meat well done and a little burnt. So I always asked for a nice well done piece of meat. The meat options were plentiful. The sausage and steak was extremely good. I suggest the flank steak. Funny how between choices of filet minion, rib eye, sirloin, etc. My favorite is flank steak. Besides the spider this was an amazing place. I highly suggest it.

I was pleasantly surprised by a host of attentive waiters and maître d, skewer after skewer of deliciously grilled meats, whichever ""doneness"" I preferred, filet mignon with bacon, or Parmesan cheeses, garlic steak, prime rib, sausage, chicken, pork, a delicious array of sides including the must have rice as well as crispy fried plantains, and a huge salad bar with pretty much every thing but the bacon bits! The salads were gourmet of course, no fake n bake needed, very little dressing either. There were your green salad mixes, captures, tabbouleh, quinoa salads, bean salads, pretty much everything and it was all delicious! Apparently they have sushi as well on weekends, I was only here for a Tuesday lunch. The desserts were amazing as well, the chocolate layer cake and the passion fruit mousse were, simply put, spectacular. But my favorite, was the fact that they have a Rioja wine by the glass here, a Rioja crianza no less, and I had to stop myself after two, as much as it pained me to, the perfect balance with the meats and full body yet drinkable smoothness made my night overall, fantastic. And the servers. All of them. I can't even pick a favorite, they are all wonderful, very attentive, and brought me several Brazilian steak sauces including churascurrio, a vinaigrette, and this spicy epic thing that will burn your tongue off, and taste good too.

4.0,11/9/2014,"Homer Simpson once proclaimed, ""I can't believe I ate the whole thing."" This sentence sums up my recent trip to Churrascaria Plataforma. I must have consumed a button bursting 2,000 calories or more. This place as some other reviewers noted is a little swankier then you would expect from the outside. I enjoyed the live music, it wasn't super loud and you could still hold a conversation with your friends. We had a reservation for 5 one week in advance on a Friday night and it was a wise move.We all opted for the $65.00 all you can eat meat + salad bar. If you are strictly their for business (the business of meat eating that is), you should just skip the salad bar and concentrate on the meats,veggies,breads and items brought to your table by default. However, if you are feeling particularly gluttonous like I was, then hit up the salad bar for one round of sushi or extra veggies.As my friend Alex M. noted on his review, the choice of meat cuts were fantastic. They don't skimp you on low end stuff. I was enjoying  cheese encrusted filet mignon  and lamb, along with sirloin steak and more typical fares. A surprisingly tasty food were the plaintains (fried banana) which were left on the table. They had a capriniha station rolling around with a bartender attached to it. This mobile carnival on wheels would work up Brazil's national mixed drink for the sum of $15.00. I had to work the next day so I didn't order any, but I took a sip of one and it was quite potent.My brother and I sampled the chocolate cake from the desert cart. It was delicious, that is if you can even think about food up to this point. I would expect to spend close to or more than $100 if you are going to be drinking. I think this place works best for a birthday/business/group outing as it's a piece of cake to split the bill. The only draw back was at times I thought the service could have been quicker.",2,1,1,Jon B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",165,417,3
4.0,11/8/2014,"Went here for a Friday dinner - the place was packed, we probably wouldn't have gotten a table without reservations. The dinner choices are either the salad bar + meats (~$65) or just the salad bar for ~$20 less. The salad bar was small but had some interesting items (sushi, etc..) that would theoretically suffice for a full dinner.Service was a little bit slow, but food was great. Unlike most Brazilian steakhouses that serve lots of sausage, pork and low-grade meat, all the selections here were top notch. My favorite was the cheese encrusted filet Mignon.For drinks, they come over with a drink making stations to make their house-special Caipirinha's. A little sugary, but they weren't bad, and were $15 a pop. They also have a full drink menu, with beer starting at $8 (even for Duvel) and most hard liquors starting at $14.Desert was extra and didn't look too bad (although I didn't try it). Live music was a nice touch, but I'm not sure if it was just for fri/sat or if they have it every day.Overall a very good experience here. Budget around $100pp if coming here, but it's not too bad for the area. I'd recommend this for groups since splitting the bill is a piece of cake when there is pretty much one price option for the dinner. The crowd on Friday night was a mix of date's, groups, families and business folks.

As we got seated, we were greeted very warmly by the staff and they told us how everything works in the restaurant. They give you this double colored card and each color has a different meaning to it. Whenever you want meat flip the card over to the green side and the waiters will come to you and serve you and red means you don't want any meat. Whenever you feel like the time is ready, simply flip it over and once they see it they'll serve you! Very cool! There was also a salad bar which great selections of other varieties of food (Salad, Sushi, Calamari etc..). Everything tasted very well and please make sure you walk in with a big appetite as it is a All You Can Eat place. I believe the best part of dinner was all the varieties of meat. There was Filet Mignon, lamb shanks, prime rib, steak and more steak, grilled chicken, turkey with bacon wrapped etc.. The list continues.. Everything was made in perfection.

There is a card you fill out at your table to select your sides, make sure to select all, they are all included. Once you fill out this card you will wonder why the waiter hasn't taken your card order, they will only take it when you flip you disk to the green side, once you flio that disk all hell breaks loose... Grilled meats galore!The meat will come non stop, they will try to fill your plate and bombard you with more than you can eat, the trick to truly enjoy and get your money's worth is to flip the disk to the red side so that you can enjoy you meat slowly and in peace, they are good at what they do and the serve you fast but their trick is to fill your eyes faster then your stomach, I know I sound really fat right giving this advice but their is a science to this lol.Tip: ask yhe for a little rock salt from the kitchen to lightly sprinkle sprinkle it over your meat for extra flavor.The cheese bread is the Bomb and the plantains are the best of all the sides in my opinion.Just eat Slow and enjoy.

4.0,10/16/2014,"Churrascaria Plataforma was a great way to kick off our New York vacation! We are big fans of Fogo de Chao and Espetus Churrascarias, so we wanted to give this local gem a try. And we sure were glad we did!We had reservations at 6:30pm, which is a little early for dinner, but we also got the full welcome and shpiel of everyone we met because we were one of the few in the place. We started out with a couple Caipirinhas each because we were early. They were a little more costly than expected, but still delicious.Our service person was a very welcoming and good looking younger Brazilian guy. He made us feel very welcome and helped us choose a Brazilian wine to accompany dinner. It was a spicy pinot that I quite enjoyed with all of the grilled meats. Among my favorite grilled meats were the prime rib, beef rib, and garlic steak. I am sure the fillet would have been in there, but we did not receive any until the end portion of the meal. However, they brought us bacon-wrapped and parmesan-crusted fillets. They even brought us simply grilled fillets upon request. In fact, we also requested chicken hearts and they brought them to us immediately after they left the kitchen and we really enjoyed the fact that they did that for us more than the incredibly delicious chicken hearts.The salad bar consisted of more sides than we have seen at any other churrascaria, making it one of our favorites. They even included some sushi, which was odd, we appreciated it. I personally enjoyed the scalloped potatoes.For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse cake. While the mousse was light and very chocolatey, the cake in between was dry. If you're in the mood for chocolate after all that food, go for the chocolate mousse on its own, not the cake.All in all, we really enjoyed Churrascaria Plataforma for the service, the selection and the fact that it wasn't another corporate churrascaria.",5,0,0,Michael T.,"Seattle, WA",65,42,46

Everyone is so friendly and helpful. We had the caprihinas (I had the kiwi strawberry and my friend had the passionfruit). They were good but could have been a little stronger. There's a salad bar in the middle of the room and you can stock up on that but I recommend only getting a little bit at first, so you can save room in your stomach for all of the yummy meat goodness. At the salad bar, I really liked the risotto and the salads (cucumber, tomato, etc...). When you are ready for the meat, you flip over this circular card. The red side means they will not offer you meat and the green side means the waiters will start coming to your table with these huge skewers of meat. It was a little overwhelming but the food was amazing. There was so much meat, I forgot what was what. They had a buttery steak of some kind and I kept going back for seconds. And third. And fourths. So good! Their sausage was really good too. The lamb was ok. The short ribs were great!!!As a side, we got the rice, fried bananas, and broccoli (cuz it's healthy ya know?) The rice was ok (the risotto was just amazing, so I ate mostly risotto and not as much rice). The broccoli was great and kind of (not really) balanced out all of the meat. The fried bananas were great as part of dessert. They were sweet and it was weird eating a fried banana with the meat but I did save them for part of dessert.For dessert, we got the tiramisu and coconut gelato. So good!

Nice mix of diversity among the customers both in race and age.  The meat selection is plentiful and done well.  The salad bar was well stocked but not overly impressed with it.

The food was not worth that much. The salad bar was limited, they called it a gourmet salad bar. The service was good, waiters were always checking in, but pushing to get more drinks (added charge). So $200 later we felt like we would have had a much better meal at a good steakhouse for that price. I understand the overhead, but they are passing way to much to their patrons.

5.0,8/4/2014,"You think you know a churrascaria. Then you walk into Plataforma. The ambiance is quite classy (no tank tops allowed for men!) and you may want to dress up a little bit for dinner (as in jeans + dress shoes instead of shorts + sandals).There is a salad bar consisting of cold grain/pasta salads, roasted vegetables, green salads, feijoada, farofa, rice, seafood, etc. There was even moqueca during my visit. Everything I tried was fresh and delicious. Of course, you do not want to fill up on these because you didn't just drop all that coin to eat some roasted eggplant and prosciutto.The meats were all perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend getting the chimichurri or the vinaigrette sauce for a little extra zest. I am not a fan of cheese and yet I somehow loved the parmesan filet. The garlic flank steak is also not to be missed. But, make sure you save room for the belle of the ball - the picanha.The side dishes were amazing. The pão de queijo was slightly chewy, cheesy and warm. The fried yucca and fried bananas were also prepared really well. The mashed potatoes were creamy and tasty but the other sides were simply better. You can request the farofa to be made with eggs instead of bacon if you are avoiding the swine.The capirinhas were perfectly lime-a-licious. Great summer cocktail! Dessert comes around in a cart. While desserts aren't included in the prix fixe, I do recommend getting a slice of coconut caramel cake (~$9) to share. Granted...4 of us shared one slice but that was about all the room we had after the steak.The service is peerless. The gauchos came around constantly and the servers would switch out your plate for a clean one as soon as they seemed even slightly used. The managers walked around to make sure everything was going well.Granted, all this comes at a somewhat hefty price tag. So, I recommend going at lunch. At $40 for lunch (for the salad + steak only. Drinks and desserts are not included), I think this is a pretty good deal. Especially since you won't be hungry for dinner and potentially even breakfast.This place is in a league of its own and I will never forgive myself for letting so many NYC visits go by without eating here.

The salad bar was fresh and there were several hot dishes available as well.  The beets and palm hearts were a favorite and the table top items are really nice but somewhat superfluous....they do add to the experience though and the fried polenta and plantains were a solid add-on.  Meats kept flowing and although I resisted the chicken, I was happy to partake in the lamb and several of the beef skewers. Servers were over frequently and the quality of each cut is unquestionably high. The volume of salt on some of the cuts seemed high, but it did draw out the taste very nicely.

4.0,7/7/2014,"I came here for my birthday with a couple of my boys on a weekday. It's a little more upscale than your traditional rodizio restaurant. Expect to shell out $60-$70 for a fixed price dinner buffet. It sounds pricy but the quality of meat you're getting is probably better than any other brazilian buffet restaurant. You normally don't fill up on salad bars at a buffet but this salad bar has a good assortment of food as well, including sushi and sashimi. I must've went back 2-3 times to stock up. Their house bread is also very good and fresh. I recall one of my guests asking for it repeatedly. They have a large variety of meats and if you keep your sign green, they will flock you with their knives and skewer sticks. I love their different cuts of steak and lamb but the most interesting meat that I had was their garlic parmesan crusted pork belly. It sounded too enticing to pass and I'm glad I didn't. The large variety of meats will keep you entertained and curious to try. You will have to pace yourself as they will bring out the meats frequently. Don't feel like you have to take everything they bring at you. I'd advise to eat slowly and enjoy the meal as long as you can! You can also order sides of mushrooms, mash potatoes, or mixed vegetables. They bring these out in large family style portions to share among the table. I've been to many rodizios but this would have to be my first rodizio at a more upscale location. It was definitely worth it but it doesn't come cheap. I would definitely come back here just because the meat is that much better. Give it a try if you love brazilian bbq's.

This was the first time I've experienced a Brazillian steakhouse. First, you indulge at the salad bar. The seafood from the bar is so fresh. I had a whitefish with a coconut gravy, shrimp cocktail, octopus salad, raw salmon, some grilled portobello mushrooms and a few other items. They had sushi as well. When you finish your food, you turn your table card over and they bring out the meat. It was a bit overwhelming with all the various meats skewered on knives being brought to each person at our table, but in the best of ways. I certainly said yes to almost everything including the bacon wrapped turkey which was so crispy on the outside. They brought out steamed vegetables and fried plantains too. The octopus that the staff served was cooked perfectly. I have never eaten octopus like this in my life, it was so delightfully soft. Everything was juicy and the best cuts of meat I have ever had.

There is no dinner menu which struck me as odd at first. But I was on board as soon as I stepped up to the huge buffet. Yeah I know what your thinking. This was high quality stuff. Then after loading up there you enjoy at your table while waiters come around with about seven different types of meat to top your plate off. Did I mention it was ALL YOU CAN EAT. Oh and the had a live jazz band that started playing around 6pm. One of my new favorite spots. Not an every day thing on my budget but worth every penny that evening.

1.0,5/3/2014,"If you are looking for a place that you can eat as much as you want but, you don't care about the taste, quality, atmosphere (or lack of), noise and essentially sitting in the middle of a shopping mall's food court, this is the place for you.The idea in a Churrascaria is that asadors go around and cut off sizzling pieces of meat from a giant skewer they carry around, going from table to table. This way you can taste a variety of meats, straight from the fire without them getting cold. The prix-fix menu of 70$ offers you to start with appetizers from a buffet and sides to you choosing.However, this (over) price does not include drinks of any kind or desert (would it kill them to include a cup of coffee?).The buffet's variety is ok (sushi, salads like coleslaw, Caesar and beetroot) but the food itself is blend. A caprese salad, which has tomatoes mozzarella and basil, showed no sign of olive oil or balsamic vinegar. Blend.   The beef that was served was ok but for the most part dry, chewy and generally unappetizing. The skewers of lamb were badly executed; they had an after taste and were just...bad. The wrapped things-on-skewer like parmesan-pork loin or fillet-minion wrapped in bacon were salty and dry as well.The sides, which were meant to be warm sides 9french fries, mash potatoes, broccoli) were served cold and very unappealing.  On a positive note the service was good and very efficient, maybe a little too efficient. Sitting in the ""Churrascaria Plataforma"", you are constantly surrounded by rushing people: waiters filling up the buffet, waiters who pure water and change your plate, the women with the caipirinha (a Brazilian alcoholic drink) offering and making drinks, the lady with the desert cart, mangers overlooking and more. I had one server walk so fast by me; he literally caused my hair to sway, almost like a summer breeze...but not really.  The overall dining at ""Churrascaria Plataforma"" was not a pleasant experience at all.Finally, it is important to remember that in life, everything is relative, I am sure this place offers a great deal when compared to other places in the world, however, this is Manhattan and that itself is another reason why there is simply no justification or reason to eat here.",4,3,1,Tamar H.,"New York, NY",0,7,0

I find this to be true for most buffet style restaurants so I wasn't exactly surprised. The majority of the clientele were fat mid-westerners that were visiting the big city. The meat was overcooked for my liking and I ended up eating only about half of the things I ordered because they weren't that impressive. The bill was pretty expensive for 3 people only having 2 glass of wine each. I'd be embarrassed if I took refined guests here.

Highly recommended although on the slightly expensive side.",1,1,0,Ryan V.,"New York, NY",1,15,0
2.0,3/24/2014,"Salty. Seemed everything was seasoned with salt and then more salt. But honestly I was not impressed with most anything here. The side dish buffet had a wide variety and did have a couple of interesting dishes, such as sushi, though still perplexed as to why there was sushi at a Brazilian Steakhouse. The drinks we ordered were not impressive. Mine was simply a glass of beer in a dirty glass and the the rest of my party had the caipirinha signature drink. Not one of them could finish it as the ingredients were out of balance. The meat entrees, which is the real reason to go was good, but not up to what I'd expect. It seemed on many cuts such as the flank steak that it was only season with salt and the salt completely overpowered the meat. On the other hand the Prime Rib was fantastic. However, the bottom line was that with the cost and subpar performance from the bar that this is not a restaurant I can recommend. The bar issue were probably a fluke, but I imagine the over-salting on the meat is standard faire. This restaurant is not cheap and the issues I noted should never be a concern at this price point.",0,0,0,Scott W.,"Gurnee, IL",0,10,0
5.0,3/22/2014,"We came from Central Park decided to eat here for dinner.  We entered the door and they sat us right away without a reservation.    As I was looking around I was observing the interior decoration of the place.   It was beautiful.   The ambience was peaceful and charming.   The maître d explained to us how they served the food.   He told us that first was the salad bar and when you are ready for the main course to turn the card green so they can serve all the delicious meat they carved to your plate.  I enjoyed very much the filet mignon with the cheese.   I tried the pork sausage and chicken drum they were outstanding also.   The top sirloin was as tasty as could be.   My dad had the lamb chop, the rib eye, the top sirloin steak, pork sausage, and filet mignon.   My mom had the appetizer and her fried bananas.  She also had the top sirloin steak.   Everything was magnificent.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone else.  My dad and mom had cheesecake for desert and I had my favorite crème brulee fantastic and so delicious.",0,0,0,Marluz P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0

4.0,3/11/2014,"RED  = STOP (FEEDING ME) GREEN = GO (AND FEED ME)Whether you're a casual carnivore, a bulking bodybuilder, with your family or famished friends, this is where you want to go to get a year's worth of protein in one meal. They (obviously) have a large variety of meat, ranging from beef to chicken to pork to lamb to chicken hearts and the like. They're also prepared in so many ways, such as braised, bacon-wrapped, parmesan-crusted, and the list goes on. They also have a salad bar with a variety of items such as sushi, fish, etc. I really enjoyed the risotto that they serve there so that's worth a try. Just don't fill up on too much starch otherwise you'll prevent further carnage. By the way, the dessert cart that comes at the end COSTS EXTRA. As someone who isn't obsessed over cakes and custards, this wasn't a problem for me. We came for the weekend lunch. The meal + tax + tip came out to be roughly $52 a person.

2.0,3/2/2014,"My first time, and most definitely my last. I've been to a number of Churrascaria's and I cannot understand why it's still here. I ordered a lemonade, expecting it to be freshly squeezed like other Brazilian Churrascaria's, but I got minute maid lemonade instead. What? Side dishes were to be ordered on a piece of paper. WHAT? Normally, they just come as they please, and that's exactly how I like it. I shouldn't have to put what I want, wait  20 minutes for it to come out, and then be disappointed by the bland taste. The mashed potatoes tasted like it came out of a box, the vinaigrette was simply Pico De Gallo drenched in lemon juice, totally gross and their fried bananas had so much.. breading around it. Another big disappointment is that there was no wine menu when I sat down at my table. What, do I have to ask for a wine menu? Yes, yes I did have to ask. And I got it five minutes after asking. Wow. They immediately assumed that I was underage, when in fact, I am over the age of 21, and I actually did desire wine.The salad bar was absolutely nothing to rave about. I was only pleased by the variety of cheeses and olives and the chicken salad was decent for one go only. Otherwise, sushi at a Brazilian salad bar. WHAT ARE THEY THINKING. Seriously!! There wasn't any salmon, or prosciutto, or salami and I was deeply disappointed. After being so disheartened by the poor salad bar, I moved on to the meats, hoping it would raise my spirits. The meat servers did NOT ask how I liked my meat. The first cut that I got, I immediately saw that it was medium rare. I have had steak MANY times and I know how I like my meat. I know I eat my meats at MEDIUM and I know what MEDIUM looks like, yet the meat server spat in my face and told me that it was medium. ARE YOU JOKING? DONT YOU DARE TELL ME HOW MY MEAT IS COOKED I KNOW WHAT MEDIUM IS AND THAT IS NOT IT. So, instead of arguing, I sat there, and I said fine, and ate my medium rare meat. I asked for chicken hearts and chimichurri after my first medium rare cut. I waited nearly fifteen mines for chimichurri that had garlic that overpowered my entire table. I couldn't even get it down my throat. I trashed that as well. I can't even remember what I did within the thirty minutes that I was waiting for the chicken hearts to come out. I think I sat miserably waiting for meats OTHER than picanha and filet wrapped in bacon. Literally, the entire time I waited, all that came by my table was those two meats. I asked for lamb multiple times, and I never got it. It wasn't until I was fed up and I was ready to leave did my four chicken heart's come bumping out. Oh dear. I was so sad I just couldn't even eat more than one. I recently got engaged, and my fiancé and I were out hunting for a reception hall for out party. Now, as horrible as the FOOD was, I wanted to see how the SERVICE was in trying to impress guests and trying to draw them in. So I approached a man in a suit, and asked about their private rooms. He was very polite. He took my fiance and i to a private tour of the private rooms, and when he was out of sight from his coworkers, he took a seat in a couch, and the words that came out of his mouth were, ""I am so busy, so tired, I need a minute to sit down and relax.""WHAT! Okay, I understand you have probably been working for a max of 5 hours, but you NEVER do that in front of GUESTS. Aren't you supposed to be a bit more professional and classy? Wow. Save your money. Luckily, I came here during lunch hour. Saved myself the misery of eating during dinner time and paying dinner price for something that made me so sad.",6,3,1,Tiffany Q.,"Houston, TX",300,35,15

Everything was good (meat and salad bar and sides) but not excellent - we used to go to Rodizio in Tribeca and food was slightly better.In the end we order a dessert - cheesecake is good - and they brought it with a candle 'cause of our anniversary, which was very nice and appreciated. In the check they wrote down two Full-meal Rodizio dinner, which was wrong, 'cause I had only the salad bar, and I had to complain again, which is not funny.So, maybe the problem was just the very busy evening - it was REALLY crowded -  but I had to wait and to complain, which I dont really like, for food which is good but not to die for.

It was a really nice way to start off what would be our three and a half hour dinner.Once we were done with our appetizers, we flipped over our cards from red to green. Within the minute, waiters came over with different meats, mostly different kinds of steak. It was delicious and you could never go wrong with Brazilian steakhouses.What prevents me from giving this establishment five stars is their lack of variety. Sure, they had beef, lamb, pork, and chicken, but the meat served were all variations of the same thing. I have been to cheaper places that had a larger variety of meat than what was served here. Also, their fruit dessert was super sour and not very savory - but I guess that's what I get for wanting to eat a fruit cup when nothing is in season.The staff were excellent, they always made sure that we were comfortable, filling up our water and asking what meats we preferred to have.

Sides include the typical array of mashed potatoes, yucca fries, fried plantains. etc...all good.   As soon as the barrage of meat begins, it is nonstop from every angle.Sirloin, Filet Mignon, Leg of Lamb, Lamb Chops, Chicken, Chorizo, Prime Rib, Pork Roast, Pork Ribs, Beef Ribs........For a carnivore such as myself, this should have been amazing, but there were some negatives:Lamb was a little gamey.  Some meats were incredibly salty.  Parmesan cheese is a poor choice to encrust meat with, kinda funky. They served both a filet mignon and a pork like this.  My complaint is more about Rodizio in general I suppose.  But personally, I'd rather go to a good steakhouse and get a quality cut of meat, as opposed to stuffing my face with mediocrity.  This place is $60 per person.  Porterhouse at most steakhouses is around $50 per person.  And it's soooo much better.  That being said I think this spot is a little overpriced.Also, I ordered a beer from a waiter.  Like he handed me a beer list and waited for me to choose one.  I did.  He acknowledged.  He took the beer list....and was never to be seen again.  Literally half hour later, different waiter takes my drink order.  At this point I wasn't sure I even wanted it, but out of curiosity I ordered again.  This time I get the beer.  Check comes at the end....2 beers on the bill.  Shit like this is mind boggling to me.  If it were a little cheaper, I'd be quicker to return.  As I said, it wasn't in any way bad, but I prefer quality over quantity.",1,1,0,Vincent T.,"Long Beach, NY",387,180,3

When that card is on green you are bombarded non stop with guys brings around many different types of Brazilian meats. Some are normal basic meats such as sirloin and filet mignon but it also gets quite creative. They offer things like Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon and lamb chops.

3.0,1/3/2014,"Disappointed that the salad bar lacks variety of food and that meat that is served to your table for unlimited amount is not that great in terms of quality. Buffet style of brazilian steakhouse. You pay ~$60 per person, and you can enjoy meat, salad bar, and side dishes (dessert and drink are not included) as much as you want. 1) Meat was not great in quality. Beef, pork, chicken, turkey, lamb - they have all kinds of meat, but given that this place is buffet style, which means that they don't take your personal order reflecting your preference, quality is not that great. Some prime steak was too well-done, not tender, and not juicy at all; some sirloin steak was too salty; some pork ribs was very tough and hard to chew.2) I didn't enjoy salad bar at all. Some salads, one kind of pesto pasta, 2~3 kinds of rolls, grilled vegetables, fried calamaris - all of these were like what we usually can get from typical deli places. 3) We ordered few glasses of wines which were $12-15 per glass, but it didn't taste that good compared to other italian or french restaurants where they charge a glass of wine in comparable $$ range.4) Dessert is not included. We ordered tiramisu and coconut caramel cake, both of which were our favorite dishes out of all (including meat) that we had that dinner, but the two were total $20.

5.0,1/3/2014,"I am Brazilian and have been eating rodizio since I was a little kid. I've tried them all, been to many different Churrascarias, in the US and Brazil, and this is the best rodizio you will ever eat in the NY/NJ area! I'm sorry but the Newark, NJ churrascarias do not even compare to Plataforma.  The only downside is that Plataforma does get really packed, mostly due to its location.  For those who have never eaten rodizio,  you pay a fixed price (Drinks and desert are not included) and the waiters brings various different types of meat, until you have had enough. Waiters will give you a two sided coaster (Red means stop, Green means go). When your coaster's green side is face up, they come serve you meat. When you flip it to the red side, they stop. The rodizio includes a salad bar, one of the best ones I've tasted so far. The salad bar is includes seafood, sushi, ceviche, cheeses, cold cuts, risottos, some Brazilian traditional dishes, and the traditional different types of salad offerings.The servers come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are different kinds of meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb, turkey). You pick the meat you want, the waiter cuts through, and the server will only stop when you tell them to. The meats that come around are absolutely amazing and ranges from: Filet Mignon chunks wrapped in bacon, Turkey chunks wrapped in bacon, Roast beef, Rump roast, Beef short ribs, Lamb, Pork ribs, Linguica (Brazilian sausage), Chicken hearts (a Brazilian delicacy) ,Grilled dark-meat chicken, prime rib, flank steak, skirt steak, rib-eye, top sirloin (picanha), zucchini-wrapped chicken, and much more.  My favorite and probably every Brazilian's favorite: the picanha (you will not be disappointed!)  Also, they offer grilled pineapple with cinnamon at the end of the meal (meant as a palate cleanser between courses) The place is every elegant and on the nicer side. Jeans are acceptable - Just make sure you look presentable. They have a bar which makes the best fruit flavored caipirinhas.  I usually get the Strawberry caipirinha with sake, instead of cachaca (sugar cane rum). And don't forget dessert!  They have a massive selection to choose from!  Remember, drinks and desert are not included in the fixed price.

4.0,12/22/2013,"In one night here, I ate as much red meat as I usually would in 6 months.This is an all-you-can-eat churrascaria (Brazilian barbecue) with a midtown feel. There's a salad bar, but as in other aspects of life YOU ARE THERE FOR THE MEAT. Meat-bearers come by very frequently and offer to carve you whatever they have speared on their sticks. Each person at the table gets a paper disc that's red on one side, green on the other. Flip red if you don't want any meat at the moment, flip green if you are a champion. It's a super-efficient meat delivery system fit for toddlers.I made it my duty to starve sufficiently beforehand so that I could sample everything. The parmesan-crusted filet mignon was strangely bland and seemed like a waste of a good cut of meat. But everything else was ridiculously tender, juicy, and full of flavor. For food that's being walked around the whole restaurant, all of it was still at a good temperature, too. Do not miss the top sirloin, flank steak, and beef rib especially. Almost everything is served medium rare, but not in an excessively ""fleshy""-tasting way. For some items, they provide options for doneness.Our party had an 8:45pm reservation, and we were led to our table after a brief stop at the bar with delightful caipirinhas. They give you a little plate of snacks - meatballs and tiny cheese empanadas - with your drink. But you should be saving room for the meat.The restaurant is vast, busy and bustling on a Saturday night. It's the kind of place with coat check, bathroom attendants, and gentle live jazz (yes, they have all of these). Every table (including ours) seemed to be a large group birthday dinner: every few minutes you could hear the jumbled birthday song and smell the sparkler they bring over in a slice of cheesecake. Speaking of cheesecake, I was surprised by the solid desserts (not included in the base price). The cheesecake was excellent, creme brulee was delightful; neither was too sweet.If you are in any way limited in your ability to consume red meat, do not bother spending $60+ pp for dinner here, even with the salad bar! They had only had two kinds of frango (chicken) and one sausage as far as non-cow skewered meats. The salad bar was completely forgettable, other than in the curious presence of sushi... which was not great. Everything else is literally just filler.",18,14,14,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",960,922,1265
5.0,12/19/2013,"Surprised the meat loving boyfriend for his birthday with dinner here! We both have never been to a Churrascaria so the experience was brand new.To start they have a salad bar, with a good variety of fresh salad, a couple of hot items (like a potato dish), sushi, sushi rolls, shrimp cocktail, crab meat, etc. If you are vegetarian, this is about all you can eat, but there is a lower cost (about $10 less) if you are just going to eat at the salad bar. Once you're done, you get a checklist, where you can mark off the side dishes you want, and they're at your table in a few minutes. You get a round card that's red on one side and green on the other, and when you switch to green, the meat starts pouring in!As the waiters come around, I would advice people to only get a few meats, and then turn back to red, and enjoy those! You won't miss anything, fresh skewers of meat are constantly arriving. Don't pile up your plate, as it would only get cold. The service was amazing and the waiters very friendly, which is absolutely necessary in a Churrascaria. Even if our card was red, and a waiter saw us eying the food, they would always stop and ask if we wanted it. All the meat was cooked to perfection, and sooo tender. Each skewer has a range of meat cooked differently, so be vocal with how cooked you want your meat to be (i.e. rare, medium-well etc) because they will have it!My personal favorites were the lamb chops (quite flavorful and spicy), filet with bacon and filet with Parmesan. But everything was amazing! Even the chicken!Would LOVE to go here again soon. (Definitely make a reservation, there were people waiting at 7pm on a Thursday night.

5.0,12/15/2013,"Dear lord, I had about 2 weeks worth of meat here in 1 night! Good ole' Jando S. brought me here for my birfday, and I got Caveman Wasted from the meat. The real standouts were the lamb chops, ribs, and the flank steak. They were all cooked to perfection (rare to medium rare for me) and just bursting with flavor. When meats aren't cooked to your liking, you can request it done a different way, and the staff will happily oblige. Both filet mignons they had were a bit much for me: one kind was wrapped in bacon, and the other had this parmesan coating all over it. Not liking something wrapped in bacon may be blasphemous, but it's filet mignon! There's no need to mess with perfection. It's like telling Jennifer Lawrence to lose weight and act like a dumb celebrity. Their salad bar is also outstanding with quite a selection of different Brazilian and Japanese foods. Yeah, I was a bit thrown off by the fact they had sushi. Being me, I wasted little time in sampling only half a plates worth and diving directly into the meat. We put in an order for fried bananas, as I remembered from my previous Brazilian steakhouse experience, they are quite delicious. Nice crunchy shell with a bit of a cinnamon taste to it, and then the warm melty banana on the inside. Screw banana splits, I'll take fried banana any day! The service here is impeccable, and there was this one guy who came around with his meat rod looking like he was giving you some high quality drugs. He was so enthusiastic every time he came around, I had to grab his meat. The system of flipping your card to green for more meat and red to stop is pretty effective. Of course there were times when the staff would still come around asking if we wanted anything, but whatevs! If anything, those instances reminded me I could eat more.",4,5,4,Matthew L.,"Queens, NY",365,315,305

3.0,12/10/2013,"Came here on a Saturday night and this place was packed, so reservations are definitely recommended.  This place also seems to be the go-to place for celebrating birthdays, as there were no less than 10 ""Happy Birthday"" choruses during our dinner there.  More importantly the food; it was ok.  Whenever I go to a ""buffet"" style establishment I lower my expectations.  However, this place is different since the meats don't sit in a roasting pan under a heat lamp, and instead are carried on swords and sliced at your table.  Your party each get a little sign that is red on one side and green on the other: Red = no more food for now, and Green = GIMME MORE!!  There were some meats that were made better than others.  My favorites for the night were:1) Sirloin: asked for a medium rare slice and was not disappointed.  The meat was juicy and flavourful.2) Filet Mignon wrapped with bacon: a tad bit overcooked, but the bacon helps maintain the moisture in the filet so it came out nice and juicy.3) Chicken: Very tender and lots of flavorThere were also some not so great cuts of meat, like their garlic steak which was extremely overcooked and inedible (it could just be the piece that I got though).  I would also avoid the turkey, as it's pretty dry.  Their salad bar is decent with a nice selection of salads and hot foods - although I would not recommend their sushi as it's sub-par.  My favorite though were the sides that you get to order at your table and the cheese balls that come piping hot (I must have eaten an entire basket of the cheese balls/bread myself).Overall it's a fun experience, and the service is efficient and attentive.",0,0,0,Lin C.,"Toronto, Canada",76,23,2

The woman at the salad bar, our waiter who took our drink order, and the men serving the meat all displayed the friendliness I expect out of a steakhouse. Being my first time in a Brazilian Steakhouse, everyone here was very patient and accommodating.The food was amazing. They have a huge salad bar with sushi, cheeses, and veggies. I didn't take much from there as I wanted to leave room for the meat - and it was worth the wait. Ribs, sausages, chicken, pork chops, lamb chops, turkey, filet mignon, tenderloin, and at least 2 other cuts of beef made for a delicious meal.  They also give you free sides which basically ranges from mashed sweet potatoes, to fried bananas, to steamed vegetables. They don't rush to get you out of there either as compared to some other AYCE places, which made me feel very relaxed.Verdict: Four stars because the place wasn't perfect, but came pretty damn close. The service and food was amazing, but  it wasn't exactly worth the $63 (which doesn't include tax, tip, drinks, or dessert). The final bill for two of us was $180 with purchasing only one drink.

Went to the place with a family and a group of friends, total ten of us.

The side dishes were so-so, but the biggest disappointment was the salad bar - very, very limited selection and not that good.

4.0,11/15/2013,"Mounds and mounds of meat. Ron Swanson would love this place, especially with the selection of single malt whiskey and scotches available. Came here for a celebratory dinner, fully expecting that we would eat until we hated ourselves.Beneath it all, you can tell that this place is a well-oiled machine. Waiters and maître d's constantly refilling drinks at the sight of empty glasses and restocking the buffet dishes, giant swords of meat being carried from table to table and sliced with terrifying efficiency, while desserts and caipirinhas are carted around the room in a not so subtle manner. The live music in the background doesn't overpower the bustling conversation in the room, and provides the dining room with a classy, upbeat feel. The prix fixe is definitely on the pricey side, but I think there is a value in being able to try a variety of meats, rather than just eating one big hunk of one type. The large buffet definitely helps sweeten the deal, too.Favorite slices of meat were the garlic sirloin, parmesan filet mignon, and the slices of beef rib. Garlic sirloin just had a great bite, the parmesan filet was just the right amount of tenderness, and the beef rib had a light marbling, so you could still taste the meat without being too dry. There were also a few other things we weren't able to try, like the chicken hearts or the pork shoulder, because if we had, we would have spontaneously combusted.The choices at the buffet were pretty abundant, ranging from cocktail shrimp, different salads, calamari, and even sushi rolls and nigiri. These were all decently fresh and while they weren't the best quality overall, you can definitely make a decent meal from it, if you decided to forgo the meat, for some god-awful reason. The separate side dishes were just okay, actually pretty bland. Mashed potatoes were actually mashed potatoes with no seasoning, and the ""vegetable of the day"" was just steamed broccoli and carrots. To be fair, I guess they're supposed to be paired with the different meats, which are supposed to be the stars of the show, so I can look past the blandness.Overall, the meal was quite enjoyable, despite being full to bursting with food. I can't say I'll be here that often due to the price point, but I would definitely recommend this place for special occasions or just a really nice meal.

The only positive was the great location in the heart of manhattan and that I ate there for free. The cons are there are so many great steakhouses in the area that this Buffett is just not good.,1,0,0,Saleh M.,"New York, NY",46,53,8
5.0,9/10/2013,"Came here with family for my graduation dinner. They complimented me with free chocolate cake! Advice, if you want to get the most bang for buck, bide your time to get the lamb. It rarely comes around. They'll try to fill you up with filet mignon wrapped in bacon, chicken wrapped in bacon, and sausage. Sure try those once, but save yourself for the portions of lamb. With that being said, the Aruma (Malbec) is a great red wine to pair with all the delicious red meat you're getting. A note on the salad bar, there was a risotto that was extremely salty which i would avoid. Though not sure if that was just their fluke for the day. Comparably, if you've ever been to the bacchanal at caesar's palace in vegas, it's similar to that except you have the added bonus of the unlimited meat coming to you instead of you having to go to the meat.",2,0,0,Alexander C.,"ASTORIA, NY",156,61,8
5.0,9/9/2013,"Disclaimer: I'm a vegetarian. That being said, the salad bar was just one of several 5-star experiences at Churrascaria Plataforma. Upon arrival we were seated immediately, and moments later, a waiter came to explain the process of a Brazilian steakhouse to my boyfriend, a first-timer. We went to the salad bar where I piled my plate with lentil salad, chickpea salad, and edamame salad. I also made a little room for some Greek salad. We sat down and enjoyed some pão de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread) with our salads before Adam quickly turned his card from red to green. He sampled almost every meat that they pranced around, and treated the tong-removal process like an art. Grateful that I took him to a meatery for his birthday, he savored each bite, and encouraged me to go up for more salad. And so I did. I tried the other side of the bar this time, and treated my palate to asparagus risotto, caprese salad, and vegetarian sushi. All worth it. The end of our meal was truly special, as the waiter came over with a slice of cheesecake adorned with a sparkler to commemorate Adam's birthday, and our anniversary (not sure how they knew this one!). The cheesecake was delicious, and gone in a matter of minutes.For the salad bar, Adam's dinner, and two drinks (a beer, and a strawberry caipirinha), our bill came to $132 before tip ($26 and change).I would definitely consider making this his birthday tradition.",3,1,2,Alexandra K.,"NY, NY",307,917,57

4.0,8/29/2013,"""CHURRASCARIA PLATAFORMA"", Churrascaria meaning Steakhouse, Plataforma is pretty self explanitory  Apparently in Brazil there are dancers performing on platforms while your eating, hence the name.  You would think the big apple would re-create that ambiance... Sorry to disappoint you folks, No dancers. :)  HOLY Clogged artery!  Lets start off by saying every steak KNOWN TO MANKIND is at this place. Flank, rib eye, filet mignon, ribs, lamb chops.. you name it ? They got it.  For those who arent familiar (bc I sure wasnt)  Your given coasters at the beginning of the meal.  Dont bother asking for a menu because they dont have one :)  I was told by my friend it was a 'buffet', but it looked like a pretty darn classy one.  Which is why I was confused. Salad bar has alot of nice things from sushi to portobello mushrooms, stuffed grapeleaves to couscous.  DO NOT splurge on the salad bar, because you WILL need room for round 2.  Just sample what you want and brace yourselves the Red Meat Parade coming your way. You turn your red coaster over to the brown side, and out come the men in black.   Skewers upon skewers of every steak possible. Im not going to lie, I felt disgusting afterwords.  I went a few days ago, and I think i still have most of it trying to digest somewhere in my intestines.  but ohhh was it GLORIOUS.Your all inclusive buffet bill doesnt cover dessert fyi. Drinks are 13 bucks a pop. Typical NYC robbery for a small glass of ""Caipirinha.""  Which consists of Brazilian Rum, sugarcane, and lime. I drank one,  personally I wasnt a fan.  My friend who took me had 4 of them though :)Thanks to the internet I found out how much this place was. My friend paid for2 of my family members and I. looking at everyones comments, the common denominator in each one was the term ""pricey.""  This is $68 dollars per person folks. Meaning it cost my friend a pretty penny for all 4 of us, plus drinks.  At least you get a coffee afterwards.  (again no dessert... not like you'll have room for it anyway)Overall i give it a SHINING 4 stars.  Great friendly staff, great food, nice location.  That last star is leaving people in mystery about the price.",2,0,1,Nazli O.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",25,28,52

Much of the meat was overcooked. I had a few pieces and gave up. It wasn't worth the calories. The salad bar had a lot of carbs - like baked pasta with tons of cheese, fried rice, and sushi (that has a too thick wall of rice). They also have a few shared plates on the table - steamed broccoli, cheese bread balls, fried plaintains, and fried polenta sticks. The last 2 items were thickly breaded. And I find the frozen cheese balls better tasting than the ones here... too hard of a wall - but I still ended up eating a few of these.

I had a pretty crazy taxi ride over that started the life a bit or was the it the drinks that was pregame before the cab, nonetheless the experience at the place was nice.We made this reservation on the fly. zipped over a few minutes early and checked in. Headed to the bar. I have to say the bar tenders weren't too attentive. They were pretty bland, but for a Manhattan bar tender they don't have to do anything. Everything is overpriced and at the end of the day they don't work for their tips, they are just given. I'm use to people actually caring serving but this is a different type of person over here.After about 10 mins, our little flash thing goes off and we are set to the table. They have a pretty cool system... with the red and black cards for the food. We start off with the salad bar, which has a ton of stuff from seafood to salad. It's a nice little warm up before the holy heaven slaughter fields open up.... Fast forward 10 mins:We flip the cards and let the chaos begin. They start you a bit slow, then it just piles on. As fast as you think you can eat, you can't they just come in the swarms. It's nuts! The guy had to tell our table, it's not about how much you can get on your plate just flip the car back over.

I was a bit skeptical, because it was dangerously close to tourist central (aka Times Square), but once I started eating, I was thoroughly impressed.This place is a meat lover's paradise. You have these circles on your table. Flip to the green side, and the waiters bring cut after cut of meat to your table. Flip it to the red side when you've eaten your fill.

I mean, come on.)Sirloin steak, bacon-wrapped steak, tender chunks of lamb, skewers of meat, pork with fat practically sizzling on the knife...everything is perfect and served with sides that you choose. My friend ordered the sides for us: fried flour, black beans and rice, and plantains. We even tried the chicken hearts on skewers that the waiters brought around, and they were surprisingly not bad.I managed to polish off three caipirinhas, Brazil's national cocktail made with the ever-elusive cachaça liqueur that's nearly impossible to find in your average bar. I had one traditional caipirinha, and the other two were passionfruit with chunks of pineapple.

Their salad bar has some amazing salad, sushi, sashimi, potatos au gratin with ham, mozzarella/basil/tomato treats and lots more!The absolute best part of this restaurant is the amazing meat selection. Upon being seated everyone is given a round thing that resembles a drink coaster. One side is red and one side is green - this is for meat servers to note as they go around with huge pieces of meat serving people from table to table. Red means ""stop the meat"" and green means ""give me more meat!"".Almost tempted to throw in the towel after my adventure at the salad bar, I managed to eat an impressive amount of delicious meat. Love how they catered to those of us who like our meat medium rare and others who prefer it well done or somewhere in between. I sampled almost everything from their signature churrascaria, to pork belly, chicken, sirloin/hangar/flank steaks, pork loins, ribs, bacon wrapped beef...etc.Drinks wise I had their classic Caipirinhais This is Brazil's national cocktail, made with cachaça (sugar cane hard liquor), sugar and lime. Cachaça is Brazil's most common distilled alcohol and it's basically Brazil's version of rum. We also had their strawberry ones and they were all deliciuous and SUPER potent.Despite our entire group being happily filled to the brim, we all decided to at least try desert. My creme brulee was delicious, but I have had superior ones - it's tough to complete with French restaurants and my trip to Paris where I had the most amazing vanilla bourbon creme brulee.My friends ordered their tiramisu, chocolate mousse and coconut flavored flan and everyone was quite enamored with their desert.

1.0,6/9/2013,"I've been to a (rather large) handful of AYCE Brazilian restaurants in the last few years and Churrascuria Plataforma plummeted straight to the bottom of my list after my lunch here last Wednesday. First and foremost, the meat - which should be the star of any Brazilian barbecue place - was not cooked as well as I've had it at other places, such as Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, or even the smaller M Grill in Los Angeles. For example, the medium to medium-rare cuts I asked for were undoubtedly rare and bleeding all over my plate, and the chicken and lamb pieces I had were overcooked and borderline dry. The salad bar was fine, but the side dishes that apparently come with the meal were not set at our table until we were almost FINISHED with lunch. We originally thought the extra dishes were complimentary because one of the servers managed to splatter meat juice and blood all over my cousin's dress shirt, but after looking around at the other tables we realized they had brought the sides to us late. Totally inexcusable.In addition to the incident above, my uncle (and eventually the rest of our party) continuously asked for the lamb to be brought around a second time. It took almost the entire lunch for the lamb to come around again, and I don't even think it was because all of us were asking for it... it was just part of the regular rotation and happened to come out. Also, to top it off, one of the servers sliced meat into my WATER, and it took forever to get a new glass.Overall, service is poorly organized and the bulk of this negative review. We rarely saw the same servers twice, which is probably why it took forever to get anything from anyone.

I have to note that the lamb was bit tough for me. The meat wasn't absolutely amazing but it's pretty good considering it's all you can eat. Dessert costs extra and you will want to be careful what you eat for dessert especially after eating all that meat. I had a papaya cream (ice cream with papaya mixed in, smooth not chunky). The waiter (good service) offered me some Cassis (a red liquor) to go on top of the ice cream. I'm not sure if it was supposed to come like that, but he says that's how they eat it in Brazil.

I didn't really know what to expect but before coming in I was told that you would be offered a large amount of meat and that it was Brazilian. My friend was graduating from college, finally, and her father treated a few of us to a dinner meant for kings. Fyi, this is not the place to go if you are slowly recovering from an eating disorder. Not even kidding on this one. The amount of food offered to you is overwhelming. Amazing! But so overwhelming. The salad bar has an enormous variety of options. One of which you need to weigh cautiously since after you finish your unlimited amounts of salad bar you will be offered unlimited amounts of every variety of an animal you can possibly imagine. I took some healthy greens, a little soft shell crab, a piece or two of their sushi and topped it off with a scalloped potato side. After one helping I was ready for the meat. It just kept coming and coming and coming. I tried to take as much as everything as possible. The filet mignon was pretty great as well as the sirloin. I'm not even quite sure as to what of everything I consumed. But towards the end of my being incapable of eating anymore there were still slabs of meat on my plate and more coming to the table. Other sides that came with it were fried polenta, mashed potatoes that were out of this world, steamed vegetables, doughy little bread balls. I know I'm forgetting half of everything because I couldn't even fit everything in. Desert came around and I ordered the chocolate mousse which was pure decadence. The richest freaking mousse that I have attempted to eat in my life. Incredibly thick and dense. Other people ordered crème brulle, a tiramisu pudding, fresh fruit.

First my clients and I be seated, and I'm assuming the lead waiter came to us, asked if we ever tried Brazilian Steakhouse before, my clients are from Norway and this is something different for them, the waiter was very nice, explained to them how it work, and the little ""green"" and ""red"" sign on the tableOnce he's done, and oh...boy, they are going at it, I told them, take it easy, it will be so..much food coming, you have to eat slow......The steaks are good, no doubt about it, however, the steak cutter person, some of them are not very good. I'm not sure if they know, but the steak is not suppose to cut thick, suppose to be as tin as possible, so you can taste the sweet of the steak. Some of them cutting is like 1/2 ins size, that's way too tick, or for me at leastWe were there till almost 6:30pm, and we saw how the restaurant really picking up for dinner, and the ""suppose"" to be the salad bar, now they got like cocktail shrimp, sushi etc. It was crazy, and like I mentioned before, you don't come here to eat, you come here to stove everything in you. lolOverall, 4 starsIf you are in the area, make sure you stop by, but don't bring no first date here.

The place is really expensive though, and I can't say that their meats are any better than the other, much cheaper churrascarias.Start with a huge buffet filled with all types of seafood, rice, pasta, salads, and more. But my suggestion is you don't eat it at all, or if you do, have very little of the buffet and save all the room you possibly can for the meats.The Meats:You get every conceivable meat brought to your plate and cut right in front of you off the skewers. They even create some perverse, but oh so delicious combos, such as sausages wrapped in bacon! Included with the meats are mashed potatoes, rice, beans, cheesy bread, and more.

3.0,4/10/2013,"I'm a little biased about my experience here because Brazilian barbecue is a huge vice of mine and I take my meats very seriously. The three stars here are not because their food was bad or because the service was miserable or that the ambiance was dull. It did well (or somewhat well) on all of those categories, but for the exorbitant price per person, I was expecting more.Let me begin by saying that there is a pay-per-pound brazilian place right next to my house in Astoria. I love that place because the meats are thick and fatty, all at around $7.99 a pound. Muy excellente! However, Churrascaria Plataforma is over $60 per person and provides similar or lesser quality meats, which is a huge no-no.The Raw Bar:- Sushi: the salmon pieces were pretty good, though my brother didn't like the slight smokey flavor that some of the pieces had. The rolls were alright but they are very standard so you should not get filled off of them.- The shrimp cocktail was succulent and I kind of gorged myself on them when I should have been saving room for some of the good stuffThe Ordered Sides- Rice was pretty standard- The Yucca Flour was kind of weird,.. didn't order it but they gave it to us.The Meats:- The chicken wasn't too bad - it wasn't as juicy as I would have liked it.- The pork loin was INCREDIBLY dry. I only asked for one slice because after he cut the first piece, I knew that I wouldn't even finish that one- The sirloin was good, especially when medium rare- The beef ribs were great BUT they only come by if you ask for them, which I think is BS. We waited for a LONG time for them and they never came. We finally asked them for some and got it by the time we were pretty much fullI think in all there were maybe 6 or so cuts of meats, which is very disappointing for such an expensive rodizio. They need to up their variety and work some on their quality if they want me to return.",1,2,0,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",801,355,90

The salad bars I've been to had asparagus, lobster bisque soup, hearts of palm, etc. I usually love garlic beef from rodizios but this place was a joke.

4.0,4/2/2013,"If you are a carnivore that likes to eat and likes to eat big, then  this is the place for you. Churrascaria Plataforma is not all you can eat. It's all  you could possibly eat.Imagine an assembly line of different tasty meats and you are sitting  at at the head of a conveyor belt of food that never seems to stop. If  you are not too careful, you will be stuffed in a matter of minutes.  Pace yourself. This is marathon of food, not a sprint.If you aren't familiar with a Brazilian churrascaria they give you a  little coaster that is green on one side and red on the other. Green  means ""keep the meat coming."" Red means ""stop feeding me, I'm getting  those heart palpitations again.""I'm a pretty big eater and I was down for the count after about 30min.  Between the endless meat servers, the salad bar, and the free sides,  it can be overwelming. But I guess that's the idea. I use the term  ""salad bar"" lightly. Whenever there's a salad bar that has meats and  pasta that's my kind of salad bar. We didn't touch anything that was  leafy green. Aside from onion rings, I don't think I ate anything that  wasn't walking around on it's own at some point.As far as the meat selection and quality goes, it was all very good.  Some were a bit on the salty side, particularly the beef ribs even  though I really enjoyed them. I was drinking water like crazy. The  servers weren't as liberal with the water refills as they were with  the meat. I guess that's a good way to get you to stop gorging. My  favorite meats were the beef ribs, the top serloin, and, surprisingly,  the lamb. The sausages were just ok. Both the pork and the prime rib were so-so. Didn't try the chicken because I'm at a churrascaria. Not here to eat healthy. If I'm going to eat chicken I might as well eat the salad at  the salad bar. They had bacon wrapped turkey which I felt was a poor  use of bacon. Again, healthy should not intergrate with unhealthy.I know I'm probably fueling fires but I've been to Brazil and I wasn't  impressed by the meat quality down there. That's why I wasn't surprised that NY,  which is known for it's steak, would offer up a better Brazilian style  place than Brazil.If you come before 4pm the prix-fixe about $20 cheaper. This place is geared for  large parties so I'm sure they make a killing at dinner. I usually  don't like too many places in the midtown area but I will make an  acception in this case.

There were times where I had to turn the card back to red because they were coming too fast with all the different cuts of meat. The salad bar looked alright but lets be realistic you are not coming here to eat at the salad bar. The little pieces of bread with cheese inside were delicious. I could probably eat them all day long but once again not the reason I went. Onto the meats! All of the meats were cooked pretty well. One or two of the meats were well done and too dry for my liking but stuff happens so I can let it slide. The prime rib, beef ribs, ribeye, and picahna were my favorite. The bacon wrapped filet wasn't too bad either. They have a leg of lamb as well but I didn't really like it. Overall the meats were delicious and most of them were med rare just the way I like it. A tip for anyone who is planning to go there...pace yourself. I did not and tapped out pretty quickly...For desert I had a coffee and the other members of my party had coconut and orange sorbet. Both were pretty good. Relative to other churrascarias Plataforma is on the pricier end. However, the wide selection of meats as well as the excellent and attentive servers more than make up for it. I would definitely go back again. I took off 1-star because some of the meats were well-done. (If I could I would really only take off 1/2 a star for it) OH YES!

I came here this past Saturday for a birthday. We had called to make reservations since it would be a large party. They told us 8:30 pm would be our reservation time. Fine. We arrived at  Plataforma around 8:15 and alerted the hostess about our arrival and our reservation. The restaurant was packed with diners and lots of people waiting for a table. Good thing we made reservations ahead of time, right?!....wrong! We were handed one of those remote buzzer things and were told to have a seat and that our table would be ready in five minutes. Half and hour later and many attempts to ask about our table, it was finally ready. I was starving and irritated. We were seated in a back room away from all the hustle and bustle of the large dining area. This must have been where they seat the large parties, since there were two other large groups sitting back there as well. I didn't mind. The waiter came to explain how everything works, but we were no strangers to the Brazilian dining experience. Time to eat! We headed straight for the salad bar. The salad bar had very good selections of high quality eats. All different types of cold and hot salads. The calamari and roasted potatos were really good. As soon as I sat down I turned my indicater to green, bring on the meat!!! I finished my salads and the first cut of meat came. Delicious medium cooked steak! I usually like my meat cooked well done, but this was like butter! I was going to make my way back to the salad bar, just cause I didn't want to eat meat alone. But to my surprise, the waiters came with massive amounts of side dishes. I was not aware that you get sides. I thought it was salad bar only! We got creamy mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and carrots, fried polenta, and this brazilian side which I'm not sure of the name, but it was pretty much a sweet plaintain breaded and fried. It was sooo good!Lamb, chicken hearts, sausage, chicken. So much meat and it all kept coming!. I wanted everything and soon my plate was piled high and I had to stop! I turned my indicator to red and threw in the towel. Next came dessert. I have no idea how I did it, but I had a coconut flan. And it was delicious.

In actuality, this salad bar is far from a ""salad"" bar as they not only offer fresh greens with a plethora of salad add-ons, but they have decently made sushi, creamed slices of potato with ham, saffron rice, crab salad and other awesome items you feel are more like entrees and appetizers than belonging to the salad bar.For the meat, that green/red disc is absolutely DANGEROUS!

First the steaks, Sirloin, Rib Eye, Flank, Filet Mignon wrapped in crispy cheese, Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon?! The last 2 are a heart attack waiting to happen, but so good!

The steaks are very fresh and just make sure you ask for the correct cook of the steak you want as they usually ask you if you want the Medium side or the Well- done side.I've been here twice and can't wait to go back again already. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it if it's your first time. You will never look at meat the same way again!",4,1,3,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624
5.0,2/11/2013,"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants! Although it is on the pricey side, I think it is well worth the money and you definitely get your money's worth. After trying a Brazilian restaurant in Aruba, we were happy we found one back home in NY! Whenever my family from Italy comes to visit, this is always a favorite stop. The salad bar along will fill you up. My favorite item from the salad bar are the creamy potatoes. For people who have yet to try a Brazilian rodizio restaurant, you have a card with Red and Green on each side. The Red means you are not ready for the meat. Once you are ready for the 12 different kinds of meat they bring out and slice off the skewer for you, you turn your card over to the green side and they don't stop serving, until the card gets flipped back to red. Along with this, you choose your sides & the plaintains are a personal favorite. The cheese balls they serve when you first sit down are equally as amazing. For dessert, they wheel over a dessert cart and show you what they have. Dessert heaven! Everything is delicious at Churrascaria & cooked to perfection.

All but one of the dishes was too well done and I'm a rare meat fan. So it was hard for me to really put the feedbag on. I don;t think I ate half of what I normally would have.

We started off with the (very long) salad bar and to my surprise, not just lettuce! Some of my faves were the octopus risotto,grilled vegetables, and garlic-sauteed kale.Then came the meat! We each got a round card that was green on one side, red on the other. Green means ""bring on the meat!"", red means ""stop, i'm too full right now!"" flank steak, rib eye, prime rib, chicken wings, sausage weiners...I lost count of the variety of meat options after the first several savory bites! Everything was so delicious! It was really fun to grab the meat off the skewers with the little tongs they give you, as though you're ""claiming"" your very own piece of meat!Service was excellent. Busy dining room for a Saturday lunch, but the servers were always very attentive to refill our water glasses and made sure to bring on more meat skewers once we flipped our cards to green!Also, the reason why my Brazilian coworker suggested a lunch instead of a dinner: you are so full afterwards, that you just want to go home and food-coma pass out!",0,0,0,Lisa W.,"New York, NY",12,34,17

5.0,1/30/2013,"this is by far my favorite brazilian rodizio restaurant!!!    i first found out about this from my bf.  he's gone a few times and he urged me to try it.   this place is a tad on the pricey side and with drinks, be prepared to pay about $100 per person.   if you are looking for an authentic rodizio experience, you should here.i recommend making reservations since this place is very busy.  it is around times square after all.   the salad bar is amazing and has a plethora of choices.   don't forget to try the sushi and the cheesy bread.   it's absolutely delicious!my favorite and must try is the picanha.  this is a cut of meat that they don't do here in the US and it is to die for.   i am normally not a red meat eater (more of a chicken/fish kind of girl) and it is really hard to get me to like steak.    this steak is really seasoned and it is cooked to perfection!   everyone must try this and remember to eat it the proper way!   i saw so many people eating it wrong.the chicken hearts are also really good!    growing up, my family ate all sorts of weird stuff like tripe, chicken heart, chicken feet etc (stuff i don't like to eat) so when my bf first urged me to try the chicken heart, i was like what!  ewww no.  i'm glad he convinced me to try it because i loved it.  i twas so so so so good!!!   it's a bit chewy and the texture isn't really like meat.   the seasoning also makes it very tasty.   please give it once try at least before judging it!   i personally think the chicken hearts were way better than at brasilia grill in newark.the guarana soda is a brazilian soda and is so so so so good!!!   it tastes kinda like ginger ale and i love ginger ale.    this is a great pairing with your food if you are not an alcoholic drinker.    if you want alcohol, you should try the brazilian specialty - cachaca.  it is very strong, but also very good.something they have here that a lot of other brazilian rodizios don't have is the hearts of palm.   that's also really good and it is different.   it's also expensive so i'd recommend eating a few!the other meats were also good - turkey wrapped in bacon, reg steak, sausage, etc.   i tried them, but i mostly stuck with the picanha.   they were good though so nothing wrong with it, but i wanted to save my stomach for something i really loved.if you are coming here with a group and are going to drink, i would recommend doing their all inclusive package that comes with the alcohol.  i know it is a little pricey, but it saves the headache of having to calculate things at the end.this is by far my favorite rodizio place and everyone must try it out!",0,0,0,Angeline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,623,346
5.0,1/30/2013,"Churrascaria Plataforma is not a traditional steakhouse but it certainly has some of the best meats in NYC. The Brazilian style rodizio is a fun dining experience whether on a date or for a corporate dinner. Make sure to eat the meats first before going to the appetizer bar in order to not fill up too fast. Either way, all of the food presented is delicious and well made. Our favorites are the skirt steak, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, sirloin, and fried yucca as a side. The wine list is extensive and can be a bit overwhelming but there are options for all price ranges from $40+. Also, the dessert cart has great options, especially the creme brulee. The waiters and rodizio servers are all very friendly and respond quickly to any requests. We always have a great time at this restaurant. We've gone for Valentine's Day as well as regular weekend nights and it's always a fun experience. The wait is never too long and there is a bar area where you can order drinks while you wait.

2.0,1/28/2013,"Hmmm, I'm writing from my perspective as not at all a big carnivore, but I wanted simply to comment on this as a ""great Brazilian restaurant,"" as some have labeled it. Yeah, the Brazilians like their meat, but this place is so far removed from the incredibly vast array of foods that Brazilians love to eat, that I wanted people to understand that this ain't all there is. This is NOT your typical Brazilian fare. Yeah, it's meat, and a lot of it. You won't leave hungry. But big deal. The prices are outrageous for what it is. It looks and feels like a smorgasbord, it's not at all elegant. The non-meat items are not the best I've had, and I've eaten a lot of Brazilian food, both from restaurants and cooked in people's homes (my ex was from Brazil, and I've encountered many different styles of food from the Nordeste to Sao Paolo). You'll go here for the show of it all, or if you're a total meat junkie, and you'll have fun.

After meeting him you check off your unlimited sides, order your drink and go up to the salad bar where there is anything you can possibly think of besides of course meat.   Their was asparagus risotto, potato gratin,  sushi, cheeses, cold salads. All which are very well prepared. Then once you are done with that you can turn over your coaster to GREEN For the meat to flow. Every piece of meat is great well seasoned and cooked to your liking. My all time favs are filet mignon, prime rib, flank, pork tossed in parmesan cheese chicken thighs. They also come around with garlic toast and baked cheese.

3.0,12/29/2012,"After several years of wanting to try this rodizion in midtown, i stopped in on Sunday for dinner with my lady and her mom. The place was busy and we didn't have reservations. However we were seated in about 10-15 minutes. The wait staff here is friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The salad bar was very good. I live in North Jersey, and the ironbound section in Newark has a huge Portuguese and Brazilian population, and therefore, great food from both cultures. Needless to say, the bar is set very high for me. If this is your first time eating rodizio, you will probably be blown away. The friendly gentlemen coming by slicing meat with their razor sharp knives (swords!!)  from their huge slabs of meat off of their oversized skewers. The meat was very tasty. I gave them 3 stars because i am used to paying about 30 bucks and receiving about double the variety at just as good, if not better quality. This place was about 60+ dollars per person. The bill for 3 of us was about $330 with the tip. With that part being said, IT IS NYC, so you pay for the real estate and lack of competition. The flan was very good and so were the drinks. I probably won't be returning. BUT if YOU are in Midtown West, love meat, never had rodizio, and don't go to Newark, you will not leave here disappointed.

2.0,12/21/2012,"Let me begin by saying that I've never had Brazilian food or been to Brazil, but I know good food when I eat it.  I made reservations for 4 people on a Thursday night for 7pm. It was 655pm and the 4th person in my party was not there yet so the hostess at the desk said to come back when the whole party was present. 705pm comes around and the 4th person is present, I went with my party to get seated and the hostess gives me a beeper and says that it will buzz when my table is ready.  Um, isn't the point of a reservation not to wait for your table to be ready? First strike.We get seated and our main waiter explained the whole ""experience"" to us.  May I say after all the great reviews about this place I was really excited to try Brazilian food for the first time.  Another reason why I chose this place was because my sister had been there before and she said that the cheese bread was the best thing, she was right. The salad bar was ok, like other reviewers suggested, nothing you can't find in another buffet style place.  Here comes the meat....DRY, DRY and more DRY!  After several cuts of different meat, mostly being sirloin, I realized well, maybe I need to ask for a more rare to medium rare slice.  After I got a more slightly rare piece of meat I came to the conclusion that the meat was very bland and tasteless, almost all of the meat needed a touch of salt. I wanted to try the pork so I patiently waited for it to come out, surprise surprise, DRY! Maybe that's why above the salad bar there were a bunch of sauces like A1, to cover up the dryness of the meat!

5.0,12/11/2012,"This Churrascaria is about as authentic as I've found outside of Brazil (not a native Brasileiro, but I visit frequently and love the culture). It's important to realize what you're getting here: authentic appetizers and a never-ending stream of carnivorous cuts washed down with Brazilian beers and / or Cachaca cocktails.  And it's expensive, probably slightly more than you would pay for the average NYC steakhouse, but you'll never leave hungry.Some personal recommendations...Salad bar: Most of the items are delicious, but are not unique to a Churrascaria (so why bother filling up on them?). I usually stick with salad. Drinks: Some feel the need to do wine with steak but I prefer to do cocktails (you can do wine anywhere after all, not many bars know how to muddle fruit like this place). I recommend Caipiroskas (vodka / sugar / muddled fruit) or Caipirinhas (the same with Cachaca) if you're feeling bold. The Brazilian beers ( Brahma / Skol / Nova Schin) are ok but are more fun for novelty than taste. Appetizers: You simply must try the pao de queijo (cheese bread), and fried yucca or polenta fries, but wouldn't overdo it here either (they'll try to get you to fill up with apps as well).Meats: If it's not immediately obvious...green means go, and red means stop. Don't be afraid to be a little picky at first, use the red coaster generously or you may be too full to try some great cuts later on as different meats come in waves. My personal favorites are the picanha (what Brazil is known for) and bacon-wrapped filet. The chicken hearts are popular but they're an acquired taste for some. If there's a meat you have your heart set on, ask if it will be in the rotationLanguage: Why not enjoy it? If you want to try some Portuguese phrases say por favor (please), obrigado (thank you), and mais uma (one more - to get an extra slice of meat from the meat servers).Lastly, don't expect hand-and-foot service here...waiters are less hands-on than a typical restaurant since you'll have a fleet of meat-toting servers approaching you every 30 seconds.

I suggest not to get carried away at the bar because when the green button is on there is no end in servers slicing and sliding all types of meat onto your plate. It is definitely a guys restaurant, and the cuts they offer are really really good compared to some prestigous steak houses. I love the fried bananas offered at another restaurant in Hells Kitchen (Empanada mama), but if I can order them from here and bring them with me to the other place when Im in the mood for empanadas I would.. You wont be disappointed. Its pricey so be prepared to spend a buck... Well worth it if you prepare correctly loolllll.. I suggest a big breakfast, then lots of fluids through the day to keep your belly nice and stretched so that you can  eat all the delicious meats they offer.. Also chew really really well, quickly though because you will be starting your first bite and will have already had 2-3 servers come by to douse you in a meat lovers paradise! 4 stars cuz its pricey not cuz its not deserving of 5 for its quantity and quality",0,0,0,Joseph G.,"East Bronx, NY",85,7,0
4.0,9/9/2012,Docked 1 star because they advertise that they have the roasted piggy but when I asked for it they said no. Booooooo!Surprisingly my favorite thing here is the octopus. It was so tender and flavorful I could not get enough of it. They bring it around they same way they bring all the meats around so be on the look out. Salad bar was ok but they had too many workers it was very uncomfortable because they were just standing around staring at you.Most of the meats are overdone so make sure you ask for med rare.,3,3,0,serina c.,"San Diego, CA",907,729,314

3.0,8/23/2012,"This place was good but not amazing. I found the meats that came around with frequency were those of the cheaper variety i.e. assorted chickens and sausages. As for the good meats, both of the ribs were excellent though very fatty. The long ribs were really good. The lamb was pretty good too but the rest was just okay. Other things like chicken hearts and fillet mignon had to be requested which I found a bit silly. I had hoped for a bit of seafood but there was none. As for the buffet, it looked very nice but nothing on it wowed me. The sushi was pretty fresh but I was hoping for some more Brazilian dishes. They did not have feijoada on a Saturday night which was disappointing and not much on the buffet was Brazilian, it was just sort of a mix of salads and such. The pao de queijo was very good too but we didn't realize it was there for awhile as it was covered in a basket on the far side of the table. The other thing I noticed as that the service was really lacking. I was happy to be seated jut 5 minutes after my reservation but I was not happy that the maitre d' only came over once at the beginning of the meal and did not show his face during the meal or after. The servers for the most part seemed extremely hurried and did not really take their time serving us. One even sprayed meat juice on my shirt, did not realize and just continued on his way. Not very professional. Then there was the dessert. One of the two desserts we had was very good the other was just alright. I forget the name of the good one but I will try to follow this up later with the name. Overall:I would look for another place to get your Churrascaria fix.

(The place in Rio also did not have feijoada, which I think would be considered too heavy a dish to serve with the grilled meats.)The meat was wonderful - many choices, all delicious!  Service was excellent, and you didn't have to wait long before they were bringing another chocie to the table.My only complaint was that they did not have fried manioc the night we went there.I definitely will return next time I'm in NYC as long as the reviews hold up.",2,0,0,Joanne S.,"San Mateo, CA",181,54,0

Music was a little bit too loud for me, and we had to get loud so we could hear each other.Some Things were pretty good:The Pão de Queijo was just PERFECT, such as the Garlic bread, Fried Polenta and the Big Ribs (served on a tray). But most of the other meets were not well seasoned, and they don't serve any seafood grilled, and that was a shame. Another thing that i didn't like was that, to get chicken hearts we were supposed to order it, because they don't serve like the others meet, and was over cooked.The buffet was okay, but again, too commercial, and not so Brazilian as it should have to be. And NO FEIJOADA? That's just Crazy. There are three things that we are known about all over the world: Carnival, Feijoada and Caipirinha. How you don't serve the Feijoada?

However, there are not as many different kinds of meats to pick from in the circulation.The desserts are good as well. The salad bar is different.

The meats are all pretty standard but it is harder to have people frequent your table when it's packed in here. The sides were meh. The biggest difference between the two is definitely the service. Fogo has impeccable service whereas this place does not. Not terrible service but not great. Overall, not sure if $60 per person is worth it here.

The servers were very attentive and would often ask the size and part of the shank you would like. This really is the best service money can buy.The buffet was also impressive.

Everytime, people in my party order side dishes, and I'm always amused at that. But they have gotten the polenta and i remember it to be really quite good. The food pretty much comes around endlessly, and if there is anything that you've had in the past (bacon wrapped filets) they will bring it to you if you seem to be missing it by simply asking. The ribs were very good as well, and the bacon wrapped smoked turkey is awesome too. They also give you this ridiculous cheesebread, which is (unfortuntately) irresistable, and is sure to add to the pain of consuming such an enjoyable meal.Sadly, not one time have I ever been able to sample the desserts as I was always much too full to order them!Glad my friends introduced me to this place!

When he realized that I was taking pictures of my parents while he was carving the meat, he actually took the time to pose with everybody and even asked another waiter to help take a photo of all of us. They explained each type of meat and brought over my dad's request in a relatively short time. We went at 4 so about the time that they change from lunch to dinner and saw the salad station transformed into a sushi station. What a pleasant surprise!There were many types of meats to choose from and in different styles but the abundance in meat can get old.

Parmesan steak - Cooked medium well, coated in cheese, nutty, and actually gives the meat a little more of gamey flavor than your average steak. Overall very satisfactory. 2. Top Sirloin (Picanha)- cooked medium as it should be, soft, tender...no complaints here3. Chicken hearts - surprisingly, a bit dry 4. Pão de queijo - it rains meat here, and so should their little cheese breads!5. Fried polenta - top side dish of the night.Skimp on the buffet salad/sushi bar.

I would also argue that this establishment definitely holds its own vs. churrascarias that I've visited in Brazil as well.I've been here a few times and love the service. They tend to attract large groups and lots of corporate groups. I adhere to the rules above and always enjoy myself. Though they do have a great salad bar, I generally simply sit at the table, flip my card to the green side and let the festivities begin- I'm there for the meat only. I admittedly may have outdone myself this time and had too many sausages, filet wrapped in bacon, beef ribs, sirloin, pork loin and lots more that I've since forgotten. I definitely waited too long to flip my card to red- No more, No more! This was only done once I literally couldn't take another bite.

Thanks to yelp I decided to start with the meat and end with the buffet, and I think my friends became jealous of my foresight later on. When I finally did venture to the buffet I was honestly a bit disappointed. The dolmas were no better than ones I've eaten out of a can and the salad was generic, nothing special. I will admit that they had fish, casseroles, and other appetizers that I did not try so I decided not to factor the buffet into my review. Besides I came here for the meat. I had prepared for the meal the entire day by starving myself, and I perhaps had too high expectations. My motto for the journey was to say yes to all the meats but poultry and sausage. The pork and lamb was good but the star of the show was the beef. My problem with the meal wasn't that it was bad. Save for one or two cuts I enjoyed most of the meats that were served (medium-rare). It's just that nothing stood out to me. The sides that we received were all okay. The beans, rice, yucca, and fried bananas were bland, but not bad. I did like the cheese bread. The beef was definitely good and on it's own I'd give it a solid 4 stars, but for the price here it just wasn't worth it.

I typically stay away from the pork, sausage, bacon wrapped turkey and just focus on the beef (lamb is okay as well). The filet, garlic sirloin, and prime rib are all very good. Sometimes you'll come across a particularly dry piece, but just make sure you ask for your preference of rare, med, well when they come around with the meat.

But let's be honest as good as the buffet was who goes to a Brazilian Churrascaria for the salad bar. As we flipped the chips from red to green the waiters brought different bbq'd meats that left you wanting for more. To top it all off the cakes that ended out meals were delicious.

4.0,3/9/2012,"Plataforma is my fave restaurant in NYC for sure! I really crave their meat very often and whenever I miss home (Yes, I am brazilian!). The meat ""cuts"" are the authentic brazilian way, so you feel that you are in Brazil right away! Very different than other ""brazilian churrascarias"" where they get american steaks, put lots of salt, and its done... I also love the variety, so many different types of meat, pork, chicken, etc!!!The buffet is delicious, specially when they have ""Bacalhau"" Right seasoning, right texture, just perfect! And the feijoada... oh my gosh, really good! But I have to say that my favorite part is the service, it is outstanding! From the hostess, to the waiters, busboys, and bartenders. Everybody is so friendly and nice. They make me feel I am  home!The only thing that I dont like AT ALL is their brigadeiro, the brazilian chocolate dessert. And that is why their are 4 starts instead of 5.",0,0,0,Le H.,"College Point, NY",9,19,0
5.0,3/8/2012,"I thought this restaurant was fabulous. My boyfriend has lived for a short period in Brazil, and now in New York he was anxious to get some good Brazilian food. What an experience Plataforma was!! We began light on the appetizers (don't really understand the sushi thing) and then flipped to green. Once our cards were on green, it was a madhouse of steak, chicken, and turkey! What a joy. We began chatting it up with the waitors and once they knew we were Greek and my boyfriend was a chef, the whole experience changed. They brought us out a bunch of seafood and cheese grilled.

2.0,2/26/2012,"I must say, I'm surprised at the high ratings this place got. At this point, you're probably thinking I'm another one of those people who expects high quality steak at an all-you-can-eat place and has come here to complain. This couldn't be less true.My husband and I have visited a good number of churrascarias and we know the meat tends to be salty, the quality inferior to a good steakhouse, etc. However, Plataforma easily stands out amongst those restaurants. And not in the 'outstanding' way they might hope. In a bad way. A very bad way.In chronological order: The salad/sides bar was mediocre at best. They have only a fraction of the selection of a place like Texas de Brazil, and their choices seemed a lot less authentic. The sushi was disgusting. The rice was bland and watery with not a hint of sushi flavor (no vinegar, no sweetness, etc), and the fish could've pretty much been made out of anything, as long as it's bland as plastic. Sure, it LOOKED like sushi, yet nothing had any flavor whatsoever. The eel was actually TOUGH. I didn't know it was possible for eel, usually the softest of cooked fishes, to be this hard, dry, and utterly flavorless. Other than that, the mozzarella, tomatoes, and various other items had no flavor either.Short version: Everything on/near the salad bar LOOKED like food, but tasted like variously textured plastic.The meat was less salty than most brazilian places, but every single cut of meat was dry, bland, and grossly overcooked. Like, Canadian style. Ultra crispy over-well-done. Gross. Most meat places give you a choice, by grilling some parts of the skewered meat more thoroughly, and giving inside/top parts to those who want (medium-) rare. At Plataforma you don't even get a choice. The Filet Mignon was simply annihilated, it was so overdone. The sides were mediocre at best. The polenta was plain, unflavored, fried, greasy and bland. The bananas were probably the worst. Instead of being panfried, they are deep fried in breading. Not batter, but grainy, thin, dry (corn?)meal. Yuk. Who on earth came up with this terrible idea? We also had fries, which were utterly unremarkable. Certainly not good. The pao de queijo were the worst I've ever had. Ultrabland and so puffed up that they were entirely hollow and as a result very dry.The only good thing here was the service. They were exceptionally friendly, courteous and attentive. The service FAR EXCEEDED the service at any other Brazilian restaurant I've been. When a piece of meat accidentally broke off of the top part that I was holding with my tongs, and flew onto my chest, they immediately brought over another napkin and soda so that I could clean the stain from my (thankfully black) shirt. The outstanding (in a good way!) service is the only reason I am giving this place two stars. Other than that, this is the most expensive and, by a mile, the worst Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to. We will never eat here again. I think by now I've learned: If there isn't a Texas de Brazil, or at least a Fogo, around, might as well eat something else.",6,0,1,C B.,"Portland, OR",127,788,493
3.0,2/26/2012,"We went for the first time yesterday after seeing a play. We've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse so we wanted to give it a try.This is an all you can eat restaurant. Except for the desert, which is an additional cost. The staff was friendly and attentive. The matradee explained how to use the double sided cards that had a red side and green side. The funny thing is that when he first gave them to us, we immediately used them as coasters to put our drinks on while he as welcoming us to the restaurant lol. We had no idea that these cards were going to be used during the meal. He handled the situation very well though. He asked us if we were knew about the concept of a Brazilian steak house. We said that is was our first time, it was then that he explained how the cards are used. It was funny. But he was very nice about it.  He then gave us a small check list of different side dishes that we could choose from.So, this is how it all comes together. All the appetizers are on a buffet table. If you want appetizers, you leave your cards with the red side up on your table and you go to the buffet table and choose what you would like.Once you're done with your appetizers, you flip your card over to the green side. This lets the service staff know to come by your table offering different types of meat. The meat comes to your table on a spit and the server will ask you if you would like that particular type of meat. Each person of the service staff has a different type of meat such as chicken, steak, lamb, turkey wrapped in bacon etc. At the same time, as I mentioned, your side dishes will be served to you. As long as you have the cards on your table with the green side up, the wait staff will continue to come to your table asking you if you would like more meat. If you have enough, just turn your card to the red side and they won't come to your table with meat.The food was good. The meat was hot and fresh. The appetizers were good. It was a fun and different experience.For two people the bill came to around $120.00 including one dessert. For someone with a big appetite that's a very good price. However, I'm not one of them. Going to the appetizer table once and having one round of meat was enough for my girlfriend and I. I probably overpaid a bit. I don't think I ate $60.00 worth of food? If this was not an all-you-can-eat restaurant I could have taken what I didn't eat home for the price.With that said. I enjoyed the experience. The staff was great and the food was decent.

5.0,2/19/2012,"I can't add too much to previous reviews at all.  Meat was fantastic.   My favorites were the lamb, garlic steak, and the top sirloin.  Most cuts tended to run really rare, so if you don't like blood, just let them know.What really stood out for us was the service tonight.  If you flip that card to green, the guys are all over you, offering meat.  I was surprised at how warm the cuts stayed considering they carry the skewered meat all over the restaurant.Back to the service - I never had to ask for water, wonder if I could get another glass of wine or anything.  One skewer guy even asked what I wanted when I told him I didn't want the prime rib he offered.  I told him two other choices and within 5 minutes or so, he was back with both!I know you aren't there for the veggies, but the sides were really good, especially the fried polenta.   Fast food joints ought to start serving that instead of fries.Wife and daughter really enjoyed themselves and so did I.  Three dinners, 4 glasses of wine and 2 desserts were $260 plus $50 tip which I thought was reasonable for the experience.",0,0,1,Mike H.,"Montgomery, AL",2,15,0

We use Yelp wherever we go and we use the reviews to decide on a place to go.Well this restaurant was fantastic!!!We started at the bar with wine and best snacks I have ever had at a bar. They were a cheese filled pastry of some kind that I couldn't stop eating.From there we went to our table where we were taken care of very well. The first stop is to the salad bar which is way more than a salad bar. It had everything from Sushi to all kinds of salads, fruit, cheeses and on and on. It by far was the best salad bar I have ever eaten from. They were very attentive to keeping it completely full of everything. I again could not stop. I could have made that my meal and been completely satisfied.Next was the main course which really makes this restaurant stand out from everything else. The Rodizio style of serving is so cool. They kept bringing meats to the table on skewers, cutting off pieces of all kinds of meat cooked perfectly to your liking. I ate until I could not eat another bite! I thought!

3.0,2/7/2012,"The concept of this place is pretty simple- for $60, you get unlimited servings of tons of different kinds of meats, the salad bar, and your choice of sides. It sounds pricey, but the food and service are really worth the price- especially considering the number of different things you can try! For starters, the salad bar is huge! I remember eating sushi, bread, seafood salad, regular salad, tomato and mozzarella, potatoes, and much much more. I could honestly go there just for the salad bar. Be careful not to get overwhelmed, as you could easily fill up on salad and appetizers and miss out on the main event.I wish I could remember all the different types of meat we had, but there were just too many circulating throughout the night. The real standouts were the picanha (top sirloin), beef ribs, flank steak, and lamb chops; the only real thing I don't remember being crazy about was the chicken- it wasn't cooked super well, and there was an unpleasant crunching that took away from it. The side dishes were okay, but I just remember them being more of a distraction from the meal itself- it is worth it just to sample the different options though!The best part about this place by far is the service.The waiters were extremely helpful and gave us advice about which dishes we just had to try. They were constantly checking on us, switching our dirty plates for fresh ones, and refilling our water glasses. At points when we were so full that we had to take a 10-15 minute break from eating (when most restaurants would start shoving you out the door), they never tried to hurry us up or get us out of the restaurant. In fact, when we told him that we couldn't eat any more meat and asked for the check, the waiter insisted that we stay and had the kitchen grill a piece of fish (not on the regular menu) for us to try.Overall, this place was great! I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for someplace a little different.

5.0,1/5/2012,"I need to preface this review by saying, I'm generally not an eater of red meat--unless it's kbbq or churrascarias. I also rarely like American steakhouses (save for Del Frisco's Double Eagle in Vegas) because I find their meat to be bland and flavorless. It's a combination of my love for Norman from ""City Slickers"" and just something I never grew up eating on a regular basis. That being said, I literally transform into a cow's worst nightmare--a meat-eating machine with canines at the ready whenever we dine at Plataforma.When we're in NYC, this is always our first dinner spot. I judge churrascaria's by 3 things: selection of meats, deliciousness and consistency over visits. Of all the churrascaria's, including, but not limited to, Fogo, Texas de Brazil, M Grill, Gaucho's Villiage, Pampas and top rated meat mecca's in Sao Paolo and Rio in Brazil, Plataforma is the best one we've ever eaten at. Unfortunately for us, it's in Manhattan. Fortunately for them, they're 2000 miles from us, so we won't be putting them out of business anytime soon.Everything at Plataforma is a 5-star dining experience from the service to the drinks and the meal. I've had the pleasure of eating here at least 10 times over the last few years and every meal has been legendary and consistently spectacular. Medium rare ALWAYS means medium rare, with a slightly crispy, course-salt rubbed, charred exterior. Of every restaurant I've ever eaten at, this is the one and only that has never failed to impress every single time. Can't stress this enough. It's truly amazing to have this level of quality with something as unpredictable as fire and meat. Plataforma's churrascos really know their stuff. I'm assuming that they drained the best grill masters Brazil had to offer because this is Pampas-quality perfection. At last count, there were 9 meats that made it to 2nd (and sometimes 3rd) rounds on my plate: the picanha, skirt steak, tri-tip, flank steak, bottom round, filet mignon, beef ribs, pork ribs and all the bone-in chicken offerings. I know that at any churrasc, it's all about the picanha. And yes, here at Plataforma, it's fantastic, but honestly, when isn't picanha fantastic? Is Christmas morning/first day of summer ever bad? What I'm here to talk about is the skirt steak. OMG!! Did these grass-fed cows arrive first class from the Pampas? Were they massaged every morning and given Malbec with dinner?? I know that entraña is the domain of the Argentines, but Plataforma's skirt steak is the stuff of legend--the stuff songs are written about and sung over fire pits. It's perfectly marbled, tender yet charred and infused with flavor.  It appears that Plataforma has several main seating hours, typically between the hours of 7-9pm. If you sit anywhere near the salad bar (lol), you'll know you've hit the sweet spot, the prime dining time, when you see the methodical parade of churrascos emerge from the kitchen. They come out in lockstep with skewers angled to the left and almost appear to be beaming. Special shout outs to the pão de queijo (squishy, chewy and cheesy), the caipirhinas that will knock you out after 2, the movable cocktail cart that kicks it like old-school Brazil and the spectacular service.

The restaurant has various price packages available.  I will simply mention the following two:1.  $40 for lunch:  unlimited self-serve salad bar + sides dishes + unlimited table side meat 2.  $60 for dinner:  same as above, but sushi is available(more on pricing later)DISCLAIMER:  The following is only what I ate and therefore it is not a comprehensive review of what's available...1.  pão de queijo aka cheese bread:yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…I found them to be extraordinarily TASTY.  Even more so than the cheese biscuit everyone craves at  Red Lobster as pão de queijo is fluffy and less greasy...2.  fried polenta side:yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…Fried goodness at its best with a slightly airy crunch3.  salad bar: roasted potatoes, fish, chickpeas, mozzarella balls, etc.yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…Better than your usual salad bar.4.  It was so good, I went back for another plate...salad bar: too much to list, but it was good...yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…5.  flank steak, sausage, chicken wing, something wrapped in bacon, pork:yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…The flank steak and sausage were good.  I should have skipped the uneventful chicken wing, bacon item, and the extra dry pork.6.  top sirloin and lamb:yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…The top sirloin was dry, but the lamb was EXTREMELY TASTY.7.  NY cheesecake:yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…I enjoyed the cheesecake's creamy texture.8.  creme brule:yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…My friends said it was OK.9.  flan:yelp.com/biz_photos/Vnjc…I'm not a fan of flan and did not try.  My friends said it wasn't that great.In regards to the service, I thought they did a good job overall.  However the waiters who were in charge of the meat skewers were very abrupt and somewhat pushy as they were in a rush to provide meat for all.  It made selecting my rare or medium rare difficult and i found many well done pieces on my plate instead.  Toward the end they slowed their pace down and were more accommodating.In terms of pricing, the bare bones package previously mentioned does not include dessert or coffee.  The additional cost will be added to your initial fee and you should be aware of that.    Summary:  Although there are steakhouses where you'll find better cuts cooked specifically to your preference with better service, Plataforma is still a worthwhile place to experience.  Be firm in your doneness requests and enjoy all that they have to offer...",1,0,0,Harvey C.,"New York, NY",84,273,2290

If you're a purist meat eating carnivore, you'll also appreciate that the meats aren't altered with cheese crusts or excess salt- seemed to be just grilled. Delicious. The meal is pricey: our prixe fix meal at the group rate was $80, for unlimited wine, beer, desert and well more meat. Finally, don't forget to make a reservation!! I can imagine that the wait is long! As far as level of dressiness, I fit right in with business casual.",0,0,0,Lia K.,"New York, NY",79,438,102
5.0,12/16/2011,Delish!  Salad bar - a-may-zing and the selection of protein was outstanding!  The cuts kept getting better and the wine recommendation from the bartender was right on.  Great place for a group or just for two.  And within a few minute walk of several theatres.  Will most definitely go back!,0,0,0,Suzanne Z.,"Sperryville, VA",0,3,0
4.0,12/11/2011,"If you like meat, this is a wonderful place. It is served in the rodizio style, meaning guys with plates of meat come around and if your card is green, they will ask if you want meat and if it is red, they won't ask. The best cut of meat is the top sirloin or picanha and if you get a piece that is juicy, crunchy, bloody, fatty, and salty I would say you have done pretty well. The sausages are very good as are the chicken hearts. If there are people who are not meat eaters in the party, the salad bar is amazing: sushi, salad, seafood, rice and beans, but the star of the show is definitely the meat. If you can, try a piece of everything. The drinks are good and they have a caipirinha cart that comes around.

2.0,12/5/2011,"At the cost of an arm and a leg I would expect everything about this place to be superb. Unfortunately I paid my arm and leg times two and was very disappointed. Now I am the type who doesn't mind paying $$$ for good food-- if it is worth it. I made reservations for Nov 26th @ 8 for my boyfriend's bday (happy 26th baby!!!). When we arrived (on time I might add because I sometimes run on CP time) we were given a buzzer to wait for a table which took around 10-15 mins. What was the point of a reservation?We were seated near the door which had constant traffic. Sides included a list of plates including fried banana (my fav), mash potatoes, beans, rice and some sort of dipping sauce for the meats which we never touched. Hmm. I am starting to wonder if this dipping sauce would have made my experience any better....Anyways, we continued over to the the salad bar to get something to nibble on while we waited and the selection was just ok. I would recommend the sushi, which was the only thing that stood out to me. Not sure what else I had on my plate (I guess everything else was not memorable). We got back to table and I must say the waiters were very attentive. I think I paid  for the service and the food was just a consolation prize. Finally ready for the meats, we turned the circle thingy to green and were bombarded. After about 2 minutes of this we turned it back over to red but this didn't stop the waiters from coming over to our table. This is all you can eat so the selection was plentiful, but I would rather quality over quantity anytime.  When we did spot the sausage guy , who we've had our eye on for the whole night, we had to flag him down. Needless to say he took his sweet time and when he came over he noticed our circle thingy was on red and turned it to green, shove our plates to the side to make room for his sausage and placed a sausage on the bf's plate. I kindly declined his sausage with that attitude.  The live music was kool but nothing special. The place felt stuffy and overbearing. I've had better Brazilian styled food (Texas de Brazil) for less. I would recommend for everyone to try to catch their happy hour or lunch special and save yourself the disappointment and $$$.",1,2,1,Kenisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",171,45,13

5.0,11/15/2011,"I took my wifey here for our anniversary, because she likes meat, and lots of it.  We were not disappointed. I left feeling pregnant and in a meat coma, so I would give this place 100 stars just on that basis.We started off by hitting the appetizer bar, but we went kind of light on it, so we would have room for the all you can eat grilled meat. I was pleased to see that they had ceviche, which is a personal favorite that I don't see that often in New York. I also tried some mussels which were ok.Now for the main attraction, did I mention it is ALL YOU CAN EAT GRILLED MEAT??? I think I tried everything that was offered, the standout was the top sirloin (all through dinner I kept hearing Bugs Bunny saying ""Arise, Sir Loin of Beef,"" but that may have been from the wine). Thin sliced and buttery to the point of richness. I also liked the sausage (chorizo). The only thing I didn't go crazy over was the beef ribs, but I'm not a rib person in general, so I won't dock any points for that. We got the vinagarette sauce which complimented the meat perfectly.The space was huge, and the service was great, partly because they knew it was our anniversary, and we were seated next to the house band where we could enjoy the bossa nova and jazz set. I would like to come back and have brunch here sometime, as I'm a big fan of a bossa nova brunch.My only complaint is that I hate when places have somebody stand in the bathroom to give you paper towels. It really is NOT classy, and I don't care for people standing around watching while I pee. I'm sure it isn't pleasurable for them either. It's the kind of thing I would expect from Larry Flynt's Hustler Club or a crappy LES dance bar, as a means to milk you out of money, and not worthy of an eating establishment.

5.0,10/18/2011,"Hide your lambs, hide your cows.....hide the pigs, chickens and turkey's too!So it's my Birthday weekend and being the carnivore extraordinaire that I am, I decided to indulge in a Churrascaria, hey, you only turn 30 once, right? (SN: I'll be turning 30 every year from this point on--don't judge me Yelp).  After searching  for the best of the best I ended up choosing  Plataforma Churrascaria Rodizio.  Walking in we were greeted by the polite and friendly hostess as she quickly found our reservation and snagged a maître d' d (Franklin) who escorted us to the dinning area.  The dinning area is split level and fairly large.  There is a moderately sized salad bar situated in the middle of the dinning area and a small bar in the lower front corner.  The Ambiance is slightly romantic; dimmed lights and hushed tones, however, there were many families as well as large groups present.  Once seated, Franklin began to give us the ins and outs of Churrascaria etiquette. Basically Green means Go and Red mean No.  He was well versed on the wine selection and ordered us a bottle that fit my taste to the tee!   The salad bar was impressive with many cold anti pastas and seafood fares.  But I really wasn't here for the salad bar...so I took a few bites of the cold stuff, pushed my plate to the side, turned my card to green and waited for the meat extravaganza to begin!  The meats are to die for the leg of lamb made me want to smack my mama (and she would smack me back...but I'd take that chance for this lamb).  And then to my surprise the underdog came that from behind  and won my heart was the bacon wrapped turkey....ok maybe your not salivating like you should be so I'm going to describe this wonderful piece of heaven...crispy thick sliced bacon wrapped around a turkey tenderloin medallion.  You take a bite and realize this isn't your dry Nov. turkey, oh no, this turkey is succulent and infused with bacon drippings.  NEVER in my life has my tongue reacted to turkey (or any poultry) with such want and longing.  We also indulged in beef short ribs, beef ribs, fillet Mignon, skirt & flank steak, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, pork spareribs, rack of lamb...and yes I had a it all!!!!!!! The dessert was just as superb.  I had the coconut cake with dulce de leche filling (jealous?) which was cut table side,  my sister had the tiramisu and my boyfriend the caramel flan....They were ALL great!  I was extremely pleased with the food as well as the service.  My water glass was never empty and Franklin checked on us repeatedly throughout our dinner to make sure we were ok as well as to make sure we didn't miss out on any of the primo cuts of meat. I would go back to Plataforma Churrascaria Rodizio again and again but unfortunately my wallet won't allow (insert sad face here).  However, I did feel I received my money's worth!So if your ever wondering, where's the beef?  It's at 316 W 49th!",3,4,1,Jasmine K.,"Queens Village, NY",69,27,17

5.0,9/25/2011,"The only suitable word to describe this place is OUTSTANDING. My boyfriend and I travel frequently, always eager to try new restaurants and dining experiences. So, when he suggested a ""Steakhouse"" dinner for his birthday, I knew he'd enjoy a Rodizio. After browsing online (because I didn't want to settle, I wanted the Best of the Best) I made reservations for Plataforma for a Saturday evening. We arrived about 15minutes prior to our reservation but were seated immediately. Our table was positioned in close proximity (but not overwhelmingly so) to the live band, which provided the perfect ambiance for the culinary action about to unfold. We were greeted immediately and offered the wine menu. We selected a Shiraz and then made our way to the salad bar. Now, at Rodizio I rarely pay attention to the salad bar; for me, it's all about the meat (that's what she said). Having said that, I can honestly say that a vegetarian would have had a FIELD day with the variety and selection displayed. Freshness and flavor galore, from sushi to salads to grilled vegetables to marinated red peppers and fresh mozzarella. EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE was at that salad bar, and of the highest quality. Despite my attempts to avoid filling up my salad bar plate, it quickly became unavoidable (so much freakin food, and sooo appetizing!). Back at our table, we were given a card with about 12 options for our side dishes. Now, in my experience, you're given 3 dishes, 6 dishes MAX. Not here...no, here your choices were endless! Choose 1 or all of them at no addt'l charge! What??!! Yes...truth. We selected mashed potatoes (for his conservative palette), polenta, and fried bananas. Then, we flipped our cards with great anticipation. Now, if you have been to Brazilian steakhouses before, you know to skip the first few meats they bring around because they typically want you to fill up on the lesser qualities (e.g, chicken wrapped in bacon) before they bring around the good stuff. SO...YOU CAN TELL YOU'RE DINING AT THE BEST OF THE BEST when THE FIRST MEATS THEY BRING YOU ARE THE BEST!!!! Ohmygod just recalling it now I'm beginning to salivate...anyway, yes: every meat that circulated seemed better than the next, and I even tried lamb for the first time and couldn't believe i had gone 2+ decades without. And the variety was matched by the quality, I'm still stunned. After completely engorging ourselves, of course, it was dessert-time. Now, when I had booked our reservation, I selected it was for his Birthday, but for some reason, I hadn't considered it would have been worked into our evening. So, as we anxiously awaited the dessert cart (After we had ordered our double espressos), we see a plate emerge from a crowd of staff with a giant, decadent slice of chocolate mousse cake adorning a sparkler. This was the highlight of the evening, as silly as it may sound, because it was completely unexpected, and they even sung his name. Truly personalizing the experience. After the crowd dispersed, a staff member made his way to our table, offering us an after dinner Sauvignon Blanc. Now, normally I'm not a white-wine person. But this continued to be one perfect moment after another, as it proved to flawlessly accent the close to our evening. Let's talk about the service...now, my boyfriend and I are youthful in our appearances, so far too often we're dismissed and poorly treated at other establishments who shall remain nameless (to protect the pathetic). I'm sure younger-looking people are often confused with Immature people who, perhaps, haven't grasped the concept of adequately tipping. And I suppose since we weren't given quality service at these other establishments, they assumed it was because we probably wouldn't give them their 20%. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AT PLATAFORMA. I can honestly say I don't think the treatment would have been any greater had it been for royalty, or a world leader. Absolutely attentive, BUT not smothering, and courteous and helpful, not rude or impatient. Perfect service...and their accents aren't a problem.If you're a frugal person, Plataforma may not be for you. But...if you are a hard worker and know you deserve a treat now and then, and believe ""You Get What You Pay For"", than look no further. Because although it is about $60/head, the entire experience was worth far more. In fact, they were so generous that the desserts and after dinner drinks were on the house. I almost wish i had a complaint, because I find it unfathomable that this place does it right. Because no one has that ethic anymore, no one executes with excellence.

5.0,9/23/2011,"My husband and I came here to celebrate our 1st anniversary and we were very impressed. First of all, the service was impeccable.  I never saw my water glass less than half full.  It would just miraculously be full again the next time I looked.  One time, I got up to try the salad buffet and dropped my napkin.  The manager himself came over, picked up the napkin from the floor and gave me a new one. It's this attention to detail that makes all the difference.Now for the food: I know everyone says not to stuff yourself at the salad bar, which I agree, but it really is delicious.  Also, sometimes, it's nice to have something a little lighter in between plates and plates of meat. They have amazing stuffed grape leaves, fresh mozzarella cheese, sushi, salads, etc.  They also had risotto, scalloped potatoes and other similar items, but I tried to stay away from too many carbs.We didn't order any of the sides except for the vinaigrette, which was wonderful with the meat.For the meat, almost everything was amazing.  Pork sausage was wonderful, and all the different ribs were so flavorful and tender.  It practically melted in my mouth.  My favorite was the beef rib.  I have no idea how they season it, but I could eat that all day.  Pretty much everything that came on bone was great.  The prime rib was also really good, as was the flank steak.  I wasn't a fan of the top sirloin but that could have been because that was later in the meal and I was already starting to feel full.There were times when we were waiting for the ribs to come by again, but the other meats were coming by more often.  One of the servers just asked what we were waiting for, and immediately got the rib guy to come straight to our table.  That was a nice little touch.One thing to mention: dessert is not included in the $60 price, which I didn't mind because at that point, I couldn't have eaten anything anyway.

1.0,8/24/2011,"I like meat. I mean I like meat A LOT. So when my girlfriend wanted to go here for her birthday (with her parents paying) I jumped for joy. All I could think about was the last Churrascaria experience I had and my mouth started watering. The disappointment from that dinner has steadily fallen from 3 stars to 1 and mind you we ate there 7 days ago. It looked legit enough when we walked in. For the price I assumed the waiters would be dressed in proper attire and the service to be excellent. When we were seated I expected a menu but the only menu I saw was for side dishes. Normal, typical, steakhouse like sides dishes. Being that we were going out after, I kind of wanted to shy away from the all you can eat option, again assuming it was an option. So OK that was ""waa waa"" moment #1. We went to the salad bar. My friend's mom was handed a plate, my friend was handed a plate, I was given a look and no plate. Ah, yes so that was ""waa waa"" moment #2. I am not a salad bar person. All I can think about is the sneezing, coughing, kids touching things GERMS!! gross. But I didn't want to be rude so I filled my plate with veggies, pilaf and beans. They only provided one type of bread for the table; cheese topped bread (pão de queijo). They call it addictive. I say it's great if you want that, which I really didn't (""waa waa"" moment numero tres!). We signaled our waiter that we wanted wine. He came over but rather than actually putting the wine list on the table he held it, making suggestions. I asked for something white, not too dry, not too sweet or sour. Whatever he brought first was awful. I took the smallest sip and instantly the back sides of my tongue puckered. The aftertaste gave me agita in about 10 seconds. Oh no no this won't do. (""Waa Waa"" #4) Called the guy back over and said ""Riesling "" being out of adjectives to describe the taste I was seeking. Not Riesling but an improvement. My friend ordered a Dirty Martini, the quintessential birthday drink I think. **** Note to bartenders.......Dirty does not mean 2 olives. That's like ""Oh no I got crumbs on me"" dirty. Now onto dinner. For such a big, high ceiling restaurant, I felt claustrophobic by the time the meat started coming around. I mean one would expect more movement than an average eatery but it's like nonstop with a way too many people working the floor. Every five seconds I felt someone blocking me from moving, almost stabbing me in the face with a knife, asking ""Roast beef?"" (Fatty fat fat, hardly edible) ""Sirloin"" (looked like the roast beef), ""Flank Steak?"" (Funny thing, that looked like the other two meats they brought out!!!!!!!) ""Lamb?"" (Driest, tasteless thing ever. Hmmm grey meat, sweet), ""Chicken? (1/4 decent 3/4 Bleeeeeeeehhhhhhh). I didn't even try the bacon wrapped whatever it was. Me, Darcy, DID NOT EAT BACON!! That should speak volumes about the food. I did try most of it but it was hard to get a rare piece and it was flavorless. I guess they leave all the flavor in the fat I cut off (basically I ate the center) which I did because every time I looked at it all I could think about was that it looked like cheap grocery store meat. (""Waa Waa"" #5) I'm getting sick thinking about it so lets move to dessert.The dessert cart pulled up (though it was practically next to me the entire dinner), my friend got the passion fruit custard, her father chocolate truffles and mother some kind of coconut cake. All I wanted was coffee. Ms. Dessert Cart said a waiter will come by to take that order. Why one person can't take a coffee and cake order puzzles me but it explained the clusterf*ck of employees.

2.0,8/18/2011,"We dined here for the first time on July 28, 2011.  I was disappointed.  I enjoy Brazilian steak houses and dine at one at least once when traveling.  We arrived about 30 minutes prior to our 6:30 reservation.  The restaurant was mostly empty.  We were seated immediately.   We then learned that there was only one price for the meal, no separate price for diners who only want the salad bar.  That was my fault for not asking ahead of time.  So far as I have experienced, this practice is unique to this restaurant.  Anyone going expecting to just enjoy the salad bar, go expecting to pay the full price.  Another most annoying pricing practice was to charge for each ice tea refill.  I may not understand New York City pricing but in years of dining out, I've never had a full price (or any additional price) charged for tea refills.  At $2 a small glass this was absurd.  What was most annoying was that there was no mention of this on any menu or by the server.As for the main course, I found it mostly disappointing to average.  My favorite serving was the bacon wrapped turkey.  At a steakhouse, I would have hoped for more than turkey.  I wouldn't say the red meats that were served were horrible, except for the garlic steak, which left a lot to be desired.  It bothers me when a pricey (more than $60 a person) Brazilian steak house pushes less expensive cuts and the better cuts are few and far between.  Of course, none of this stopped me from filling up.  As I said, the meal was not horrible, it was ok.  It just lacked value for the cost.  I've had much better, though these other places were not in NYC.If you take anything away from this, understand that there is no separate price for just the salad bar and they charge for refills of ice tea (without warning).",1,0,0,Jack B.,"Knoxville, TN",0,11,0
5.0,8/18/2011,"You'll need to plan ahead if you're planning to visit Plataforma, and when I mean ahead, I mean DAYS AHEAD. PROTEIN. It's what's for lunch folks. You'll eat more meat/protein here in one sitting than you ever will, I promise you!!! Unless you're at some food related competition where you're grossly trying to stuff 23423 hot dogs in your mouth in 1 hour LOL. Anyway, here's why Plataforma gets 4.5 Yelps from this carnivore (though I'll round up to 5 because it is overall, the best I've had):+ Protein: So, I've been to several Churrascarias now and Plataforma in my opinion is the best. They have the tastiest selection of meats, the least amount of salt used in the meats (most other places use lots of salt) and they don't FORCE RUSH you with your meats. They space them out properly unlike most other places that keep feeding you and feeding you while you have ZERO time to even take a bite.- Salad Bar. Their salad bar however is a bit lacking...+ Service is friendly and accommodating though not the most efficient I've seen. The servers don't speak loud and clear enough/their accents are thick so you end up asking a few times ""what did you say?"", ""what's that again?"" etc.+ The place is HUGE. We were here for lunch and there were only 2 other tables taken...though at dinner time I hear it gets quite nutty.I tried cow heart for the first time...it was quite interesting.

The star of a Brazilian steakhouse is obviously the meat, and I can say without exaggeration this was the worst rodizio restaurants I've ever had the misfortune of patronizing. This is not hyperbole. What they do to meat is a crime, serving unpalatable cuts of bone dry and spoiled tasting cuts woefully under seasoned. I could barely hold back my displeasure. All I wanted to do was leave, and at $160 for two people, you can imagine my displeasure when handing over my credit card. I didn't even voice my resentment, I just wanted to leave.

5.0,7/3/2011,"Thanks to all the great advice - eat lightly before dinner; avoid filling up on starch or salad bar, skip the sausage and chicken - we had a great meal at Plataforma. The service was excellent, the meat perfectly cooked at rare to medium rare and the live brazilian music an added plus.Great surprises: the salad bar lettuce and veggies were very very fresh and provided a great foil for the meat; the sirloin (not my fav cut) was outstanding - get the crispy end cut that ends up being rare on the other side, it was incredible; ask for what you want, the prime rib showed up after we asked; the grilled cheese app was addictive. The short ribs, prime ribs and flank steak were also great. Our friend said the suckling pig was outstanding and the pork ribs moist but underspiced. The long beef ribs were overcooked for me, and less juicy. Also, the lamb, while it had a terrific flavor, was a bit dried out. Also, the seafood salads at the salad bar were pleasant but lacking in deep flavor. Skip them.Ask for the spicy sauce, we mixed it with vinegraitte for a tangy meat sauce.  We put it over the salad and the roasted veggies then had perfectly cooked slices of sirloin steak on top. Excellent. Don't waste time on the starchy sides - we had a bit of the garlicky black beans which were good, and one cheese biscuit to end the meal.

My gang of high school friends and I celebrated my send-off to Michigan at Plataforma some six odd years ago. Needless to say, the dinner broke my piggy bank, but every moment was worth it. Let's cut to the chase. Skip the salad bar. You're paying for an all-you-can-eat meat buffet, why would you even consider waiting in line for some greens?Don't eat the first thing thrown at you. I understand you starved yourself for 3 days before you came but you're here for the garlic steak, flank steak, sirloin tips, and lamb chops, not the sausage, turkey and chicken wings.Try the fried plantains.

DO not waste your time/room with the chicken, turkey, sausage, or flank steak.Service was good, especially for a Sunday night.Honest Conclusion: You should go to a Brazilian steakhouse a time or two in your lifetime.

First and foremost I was constantly comparing it to the rodizio down in tribeca which isn't fair I will admit. Obviously,  this location is going to be much busier, which is nice I suppose because it is lively and not as quiet like the downtown restaurant. With that said, because of all the people, the service suffers. Downtown, we are always made to feel special and the service is impeccable. They know what you want before you know. Someone is ready to offer you a second drink just at the precise moment you are finishing the first. (Do I sound like a drunk?). Uptown, we were just one of the crowd. Service wasn't lacking per se, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Also, the bathrooms were not kept well at all - that was a bit disturbing. Later on in the night, the situation improved somewhat when there was bathroom attendant so there was someone to clean up after slovenly customers who had thrown the paper napkins on the floor and made a mess of the sinks.

Advice: Make a proper reservation or expect to wait! Don't eat at all or eat light for 2-3 days before coming here, or you won't be able to maximize the benefit & justify the tab! Don't go off the range, ie. beverages (alcoholic & virgin) & desserts. The red Sangria is delicious, and the staff will refill the pitcher for the table without hesitation! A pitcher is $35, great for sharing and tasty. Take advantage of the buffet, various codfish dishes on opposite ends and cold seafood. Don't fill up on the cheesy dinner puffs or appetizers they give you. If you do the math, it's on par regarding cost, with the better steakhouses in NYC.

Though there are a few incredible cuts of beef to be brought around, you would never know or care about them after all the crap food they bring your way. There is probably a science to making one feel full very quickly, and these guys succeeded with flying colors. The first things they brought me Rodizio style was a sausage and a piece of chicken. Those were both flavorful, but extremely salty. They must have brought out 10 varieties of meat, and maybe only 3 of them were really good. Knowing how to sort which meats are good and which are not should be the what you try to come out of this place feeling. Not that you've just dropped $60 on a perfect feast. Because it was far from that. There is so much filler of crappy food it was a real turn off. The Octopus was sooo bad it should not have even have been served! Some of my meat was extremely over cooked, and some of it was extremely fatty. It was a constant challenge to find something worthy of shoveling into my mouth. Milk they brought out for the coffee was curdled, and waiter/manager/overseer tried to make an excuse that it was just heavy cream. I almost feel like this place gets such a large volume of cows coming through, they treat us as such. That being said, the Chilean merlot I picked out for $40 was excellent, and all the desserts brought out were off the hook, including my fake birthday tiramisu complete with sparkler. Bill for 5 people came out to $450, not bacd including wine, Caiparinhas and deserts, but, I would go back to Greenfield in Queens in a heartbeat just to be treated more humanely.

3.0,2/27/2011,"Churrascaria in Tribeca was supposedly the 'steakhouse even veggies love'. Indeed it is if you are a vegetarian who loves side salads and risotto. The wonderful tagline was somewhat of a misnomer. To their credit, the waiter was kind enough to offer to prepare a special veggie meal. Of course, I couldn't try the meat but maybe there is some correlation between the taste of it and the ghastlier it looks for vegetarians - in which case all the meat lovers out there are in for a treat.

3.0,2/21/2011,"As with all restaurants, you have to start with a strategy.  Don't fill up on salad or any of the starters and don't drink too much so you can fill on the real reason you came, the meat.  You then have to take a few bites of everything to figure out what's good and then chow down on that.The service wasn't too great when we first sat down (which is the reason I can't give it 4 stars).  It took a long time for the water and the drinks to show up.  But once we flipped our cards to green, the waiters were right on top of us with the meats.  The one thing that didn't come around enough was the garlic bread.  It only came by once and was pretty good.  They also made a special salmon for my girlfriend (which was unexpected).My only complaint about the meat is that I prefer my meats closer to medium/medium well and everything was between rare and medium rare.  But that's just me being picky.  The best things were the skirt steak, sausage and the beef ribs.  You also have to try to catch a server bringing around the fried cheese.Worth a trip if you have never been to this type of place before.  But make sure you follow a strict strategy so you maximize your meat intake potential.",0,1,0,Eric L.,"Washougal, WA",100,190,0

3.0,2/11/2011,"To be honest and up front, it's just another Brazilian steakhouse in my book.  It was no different than many of the chain Brazilian steakhouses across the country like Boi Na Braza.  The trick to any Brazilian steakhouse is don't let them trick you into eating too much food that is in the center buffet area.  Save room for the meats, and, oh, will the meats begin to flow and flow and flow and flow from the kitchen.Eventually, you begin to get the ""meat sweats"" as you have consumed so much meat that your arteries and your colon can handle no more.  It's a fantastic experience - it's like being numbed by some great magical drug but without the whole illegality that drugs tend to entail.If it's an animal, then they've probably killed it, cooked it, and it will come out of the kitchen for you to devour.  And, devour you will and until the aforementioned sweats begin to consume you.In the end, you'll have a decent edible meal but don't expect to be ""wow""ed out of your pants.",0,1,1,David G.,"Nashville, TN",230,347,74

For those who have never been to a brazillian churrascaria you will be in shock once you sit down. Those MIB agents I call them just keep attacking you with a big skewer of meat and they come right next to you and starts carving the meat onto your plate. The only way to stop them is to use your  red/green badge shield. Green means go ahead and keep carving while red is to tell them to LEAVE you alone. They have 5-6 types of meat ranging from sirlion, tri tip, ribs, lamb and even turkey wrapped with bacon. They have a small salad bar with a variety of different ethnic dishes. I personally preferred their side dishes. You get to pick a bunch of side dishes my favorites are the beef carpaccio, fried yucca, fried plaintains and broccoli. I thought the experience was wondeful waiters are very attentive but I thought all the meat was a tad bit dry except the ribeye. The price point is decent considering you get a whole lot of meat at $58/person.

Not necessarily bad - just different though for me I was in the mood for more greens than what seemed to be there. What I can say as an extreme positive was the activeness of the staff - from keeping things clean and filled out to telling you whatever you needed to know about what was there, the staff was there for you.When we turned our chips green the meat started to come and here I believe there was a slight edge over Fogo de Chao in the variety of offerings though I wished I knew what was available to pace myself as it seemed just when I though I had a sample of everything something else interesting came around.",0,0,0,John R.,"Warren, NJ",183,1233,353

I felt like standing on my chair and waving my Green token around so that I could get some meat.I am a veteran of Brazilian style Churrascaria restaurants and this place is SLOW. In addition, the meat wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. The last Brazilian style place I visited was Fogo de Chao in Baltimore. Fogo was sooooo much better. A chain restaurant should never be better than a standalone (or in this case 2 including the Tribeca location)Lastly....this was a HUGE pet peeve for me. Most good Brazilian places will have their meat guys give you meat without touching your plate. At Plataforma every single ""meat server"" would rest the skewers on my plate. I found this gross.

The meat fest begins as soon as you turn the little round card over to green. I won't go over every single meat offered but there's probably 10 different ones. They push the sirloin and it was pretty good. The flank steak was a bit fatty and chewy so it's a pass for me. The beef ribs were excellent and fall of the bone delicious. The sausage look good but was actually not worthy once bitten. Pass pass pass on the chicken. Stick with the beef. Turkey wrapped in bacon was ok After you are stuffed, the dessert cart will roll through. The chocolate mousse cake was to die for. The chocolate was not over bearing and the overall flavor was delicate. The cake was incredible moist and was actually lightly soaked in something (can't describe it). Chocolate truffle balls was rich and also a pleasure. The dessert was the surprise of the evening and some of the best that I've had in the city....

I went here alone (business trip) and was really expecting something unique and special. What I got was OK appetizers, really nasty side dishes and a mixed bag for the meats. So, the good stuff:* The service was really good. Attentive wait staff made sure that the wine was filled and that I had everything I needed.* The sushi...yup. I thought the best appetizer was the sushi. Fresh, delicate and delicious* Lamb, top sirloin, flank steak and long bone beef ribs. All very well done. Indeed the top sirloin was truly exceptional, as it was succulent with just the right amount of seasoning.The not so good stuff:* Price-Aside from the copious amounts of meat, my meal was WAY overpriced for what was essentially a high-end buffet* Turkey, beef tenderloin, sausages, beef short rib. Way over done and with too much salt. * Fried Yucca was actually yucka* Yucca with bacon tasted like breadcrumbs*Fried banana tasted like...a fired banana. Don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't great.* Rest of salad bar except sushi. Seemed a little aged and mass produced. Overall, I would go back here if I was in the mood and had some cash burning a hole in my wallet. Otherwise I would probably skip for a good steakhouse.",2,0,0,Roger V.,"Goffstown, NH",2,97,13
3.0,8/1/2010,"My fiance's mom is a theater freak. She's one of those silver-haired ladies who has a bunch of silver-haired lady friends and they all go to the theater almost every other day. I don't get it but then again I'd rather watch Terminator 2 or the Dark Knight for the fiftieth time than go to a Broadway show.Anyway, I had to accompany fiance and her mom to a show a few weeks ago because her friends were on their holidays in France, Spain, etc and she didn't want to go with just her daughter. Before the show, she wanted to grab a bite to eat and I suggested Churrascaria Plataforma since I knew the old gal enjoyed a good steak every now and then. They agreed and we had a pretty good time. The waiters walk around with skewers of meat and when you're ready for some animal flesh, flip a little coaster on your table setting to green and they'll hover over and start slicing slivers of meat from the skewers onto your plate. It's a brilliant system and the only place where meat will fall onto your plate just because you flipped a green coaster. They also have a salad bar but c'mon, if you go to a place like this and fill up on salad, you shouldn't have chosen a Churrascaria. At the end of the meal, you can request that they wheel out the dessert cart and we split a coconut flan which was okay. The total bill came out to be less than $200 for three people which in my book, is an outstanding result especially when it comes to pleasing the fiance's mom.",0,0,0,Jack M.,"New York, NY",0,20,0

1.0,6/7/2010,"It kills me to say this - but yelp has steered me wrong.  Saturday night I was craving some Brazilian food. Don't ask me why, but I just need it ASAP. Now, the only place I have ever had Brazilian was in Las Vegas and since we were a long way from Vegas I had no clue where would to go. Soooo I went on to my trusty Yelp site to look up place around my area (AKA the city). The first place that popped up was Plataforma (as you probably already know since you are reading this review). It was reviewed by over 257 people and had an average star rating of 4 to 5 stars. At first I was a little iffy about coming here, since part of it is a buffet, but everyone was raving about the food, so I figured it was going to be great.So an hour and half later, we are in the city sitting down at Plataforma. Something should have struck me as not right, when a restaurant (highly reviewed) in NYC is able to seat someone at 6:00 and there are only four tables with people at them. I brushed it off, telling myself that it was just early for the city and it bound to get packed. We first started with the salad bar. One side was salad and the other was a mixture of seafood, potato salad, sushi, etc. Even though nothing looked appetizing I got a little bit of everything just to try. The only good thing was the cheese, everything else tasted rubbery, over cooked, and just wrong. I don't know what possessed me to try the sushi - bad idea - lets just say it did not agree with me - my stomach was rolling right later that night.Okay now on to the main course - First of all you are able to pick what side dishes they will serve to your table - the options are things like yuka fries, onion rings, white rice, black beans, vegetable, etc. Everything that comes out looks and tastes like you could have made it at home or any fast food joint. It was nothing special. The meats they came around with were flank steak, pork loin, prime rib, chicken, sausage and lamb. Again, nothing tasted extraordinary. I could have made these meals at home. None of them had any seasoning - they just tasted very blain. And the flank steak - which is one thing I love - was extremely tough! Sadly I only had a small piece of chicken and that is about it.When the waiter saw that I was not eating that much he sent over one of the managers (I think) to check and see how everything was. We commented on how we didn't like the food and that we were displeased. He nodded and then walked away. Now, one would think that if someone knew you were displeased with the food, they would do something for you to make your experience better, but not at this place. He just walked back - dropped of the check for $130 and then walked away. All we could do was pay - and walk out feeling pissed off that w spent good money on food that was NOT GOOD! Oh and we were still hungry. Thankfully Starbucks was right across the street, so we were able to get a delicious Strawberry shake.",4,1,1,Crissy H.,"Warwick, NY",150,675,52

5.0,1/28/2010,"Churrascaria Plataforma is, hands down, my family's favorite restaurant in the city. We go there for almost every special occasion. Like when old friends from The Motherland are in town: We love to rub it in that New York churrascarias are vastly superior to Moscow ones. (Don't get my father started on this topic - he gets hives just thinking about a terrible experience he once had back east.)I always arrive and, ignoring the disapproving look from my mother, stuff myself with their delectable, warm, little, round cheese breads before the traffic of meat begins. (I forgo their appetizer buffet so as to leave as much room as possible for the star of the show.) I adore their beef selection. Their ribs and flank steak are phenomenal. My favorite, though, is the garlic-braised variety: heaven! As a bonus, they sometimes come around with fried mozzarella squares. (I have no mercy on my poor heart.)In some churrascarias (like the dearly departed Braseiro in Scarsdale), they sneakily stuff you with the cheaper meats before sending over the good stuff. Not so here. As soon as you turn the card over to green, expect to be bombarded with every type of meat, and it's all high-quality. Contrary to what one might think, the more exotic selections, periodically making an appearance on carts, do not overshadow their spitted counterparts.I highly recommend ending the decadent feast with their crème brulee. You may hate yourself the next morning for the overkill, but, then again, I was always more of an immediate gratification kind of girl.My parents are fans of their creative selection of caipirinhas. (Mom and Dad are officially awesome, no?) A word of caution: Their terrific, red sangria is extremely dangerous - it's much stronger than it seems! (It sure as hell got me into a heap of fantastic trouble... )The space is gorgeous. The layout is coherent. Aside: The one thing I always found peculiar is that the dress code is not nearly as formal as you would expect, considering the ambiance and the smartly dressed staff.I would also like to add that most of the servers are very aesthetically pleasing, to put it politically correct-ly.

I drank a lot of water last night to counter act but i still felt dehydrated. The salad bar is mediocre, nothing really pops out and the salad choices is kind of subpar. The meats are good, if you like your meat salty. I mean i enjoyed it but the problem is that i overate. I felt disgusting afterwards and I still feel full today. Their house-made capirinhas are sweet and flavorful, you can't even taste the alcohol. The dessert cart looked good too. I had the fruit tart which was VERY good.

The best skewers of meat was the prime steak, sirloin steak, and lamb chop. If you are unlucky the waiters give you the well done portion of the protein, which seemed to be lack luster and just sat on my plate untouched. This is not the place to bring a friend who has a shy appetite, bring those who always have their knife and fork in hand!

The buffet is only OK, offering standard selections of delis, salads, baked goods, and some sweets. The meats are pretty good and frequently offered refills. The service is somewhat absent, it made me wonder because there were a couple of waiters walking around pretending to be busy, but there were only a couple of other tables in the whole restaurant.  While one of the server was cutting meat onto my friends plate, he was talking to another server and said something like ""this guy just had a piece why is he having another one"" in spanish with a condescending tone, mind you that we didn't ask for it, the meat was offered to us, and it was like my friends second plate. The server must've have thought 3 asians don't have a damn clue what he was saying, but my friend grew up in Argentina and spoke spanish as his first language.

It begins with one of the most extensive salad bars, they refer to it as a first course, that I have seen in a Brazilian Roadhouse. The inclusion of sushi, octopus, shrimp and other specialites in addition to extensive vegatable choices (enough there for even the most devout vegatarians) makes this salad bar one of the best. Of course the process is fun. You signal to the servers when you would like meat by flipping a disk from red to green. Once this happens the servers will offer you whatever they are carrying on big forks and sometimes swords. They will keep bringing meat until you give up and flip back to red. The meat is of good quality and cooked correctly. I have to confess I have eaten more than my share many times.

Servers come around with all different kinds of meat and you use the coaster to give them the green or red light. Here's some advice: 1) Always keep it on green - you have no right to stop until you suffer a dizzying meat sweat. Also, different meats are brought out at different times (at any given time, waiters are serving maybe 8 of the 25 meats), so even if you are too full to add more, keep it green so you can keep your eye out for your favorite meat. 2) The cheesey bread knots are good; they are filling, but they are worth it. 3) Fulfill your craving for variety through the different meats; the salad bar is not worth it. It tastes like the business, wedding, etc cocktail food. 4) I love rare meat but when you ask for rare meat here you get it. Don't be afraid to ask the waiter/carvers to cut several pieces if the first piece is over/under cooked for you. That's the beauty of table-side carving - since they are bringing a 10lb slab of thick meat, they have rare, hockey puck and every level of cooked in between.",0,0,0,A.E. G.,"New York, NY",14,196,0
3.0,8/9/2009,"Churrascaria Plataforma, based on this one visit, seems to be hit-or-miss.  I'll start off with the complimentary salad bar which overall, except for the pulpo salad was adequate.  It wasn't great, but, it wasn't bad.  One surprise was the tuna sushi, the fish and the sprinkled on seasoning was actually pretty good.  Not Yasuda or Taro quality, but good non-the-less.On to the reds.  Most of the grilled meat that was cut actually came out as  ordered.  Ex:  If I asked for a small piece medium-rare, I got it, and the meat was warm.  My complaint is the seasoning/rub/marinade which were almost caustic because of all the salt.  Skip the sides.  They only get in the way and they're pretty bland.  Dessert and coffee?You might be better off going to one of the cup cake places, or sweets shops, such as a bodega for a pack of Suzi-Q's on 8th or 9th Ave.  Churrascaria charges about $10 plus extra for dessert and again, they don't taste all that great.Ambience and general attitude is pretty nice.  It's a warmly lit interior with pianist and accompanying jazz band.  The waiters and manager keep your water glass and meat plate full, and check to see how you're doing respectively.  It does come with a cost though.  Somewhere around $75 a pop, including tip, which by the way is another complaint.  On the check they suggest tips by percentages, however they include the sales tax as part of the calculation. This is just wrong and misleading.  Con-artist almost.  Please, change this policy.All in all, Churrascaria Plataforma make for a fun night, even a date if you feel like stuffing yourselves to the gills, you should, however, be aware of what you're getting in to.",3,0,2,David B.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,424,139

4.0,7/20/2009,"I was taken here on a date and loved it.  The salad bar, like all salad bars at Brazilian steakhouses, was amazing and it was hard not to fill up on sushi and grilled calamari.  The steak was delicious, although I must admit that I could not handle that much of it and had to red card it for most of the evening.  In fact, I kind of prefer the salad bar (I think I was more in the mood for light food), but for $100+ a person, I probably wasted some money eating cheaper food.  Anyway, it was good.  My one complaint is that dessert was extra.  For such a hefty price tag, this should be included.  Although I doubt people order dessert when they are about to explode as I was.The ambiance is not really great for dates because of the large amount of groups.  There were several bachelor parties going on, which made it quite noisy.  This is typical of Brazilian steakhouses, so I'm not going to take away points for that.Overall I had a good experience.  I won't come again unless I'm craving red meat, because otherwise I'll spend too much time at the salad bar.  :-)",0,1,0,Pam C.,"Chicago, IL",39,241,1

4.0,7/8/2009,"For those of you who have never experienced rodizio, come prepared - which is to say: COME HUNGRY! While there were some stellar options on the salad bar - most notable the perfectly cooked octopus - do not fill up there. Because the moment you flip your table card from red to green, you will have a barrage of delectable meats paraded to you from every waiter in the house. I would recommend skipping the chicken, turkey and sausage offerings, unless you REALLY love one of the three. Because what you go to Churrascaria Plataforma for is beef, and if you're lucky, lamb chops. To make things super easy, each person is given a little card that looks like a coaster: one side is red, the other is green. When you arrive, it is on the red side, so when you are ready to bring on the meat, you flip to the green side and away you go! I recently went with a group of about 10 friends, and boy did we have a feast! Just when you think you can't possibly eat another bite, and finally decide to flip your card to the red side, they bring out another perfectly cooked new offering from the rotisserie and you find yourself flipping back to the green side! We did order a number of side dishes, however, I can't even comment on them, as I was more focused on my protein intake and my sangria consumption. Please note: after having tried both - I recommend the red sangria over the white. Much better flavor and matches better with the grilled meats. Later, as we had our fill of Sangria, we switched to Caipirinhas and Caipiroskas (which are Caipirinhas with vodka instead of rum). Wow! Do they pack a punch! Delish. When we finally decided to have dessert, they rolled over a cart of all the specials of the day. Since we were all pretty stuffed we ordered a bunch of things to try for the table: Berry Napoleon, Chocolate Mousse, Creme Brulee, Tiramisu, Truffles and Carrot Cake. The Berry Napoleon was yummy and the Creme Brulee was decadent as always (although, I felt too rich to enjoy after such a savory meal). But the Tiramisu was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I must admit, Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, so I have had it at a number of places, but the Tiramisu I had a CP was the best I have ever tasted: usually a pretty dense cake, this was, dare I say it, light and airy, with an intensely satisfying flavor that was not too sweet. Very well done! Overall, it was a great experience. The atmosphere was pleasant, and while it was very crowded, it never got too noisy. The staff was helpful and accommodating (at one point a waiter posed with us in a group pic as he was holding prime rib!). While I would say you should expect to spend a lot of money when you go here (though it is a tiered prix fixe menu), I would stop short of calling it expensive based on all the food you get!

4.0,6/24/2009,"How can you be a meat lover and not be a fan of meat being brought to you every 5 seconds?Last night, my wife and I came here for our anniversary dinner (we both love to eat...go figure.)  I have been here before, having attended a company Christmas party here, so I knew going in what to expect.  She has been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before (Rio in Myrtle Beach, SC) so she also knew.We had 7 pm reservations, and were seated 10 minutes early.  After explaining everything to us (we needed a refresher,) our waiter produced a wine list about 60 pages long.  I appreciate a good wine list, but really, 60 pages?  I ordered us a nice bottle after about 2 minutes (no way was I reading through all 60 pages...)  and it came out right after we were ready to go up to the salad bar.  Cool thing, our waiter warned us not to fill up on the salad bar, which we knew going into last night.  I don't have much of an opinion on the salad bar, considering all I had was some salad, potatoes au gratin (which were really good), and some mozzarella and tomato with pesto and basil.  My wife had the same.  Of course, we were there for the meat.This is where the meal shines.  After we tried everything and turned over our card, we pretty much settled on our favorites.  The prime rib and flank steak were awesome.  The garlic sirloin was very tasty.  I wasn't impressed with both the short and long rib beef (very chewy, fatty, and overcooked.)  The topper was the bacon-wrapped filet, which is basically heaven wrapped with HEAVEN.  I would have liked the filet cooked less (it was inbetween medium and well,) still very good.  And the fact that it was wrapped in bacon made it even better.  It wasn't before long that I developed the meat sweats and had to stop. For dessert, my wife picked out a flourless chocolate-espresso cake, which was gooey and delicious.  The wait staff brought out a sparkler to embarrass us for our anniversary, which was cool of them.  Naturally, I cringed at the bill, but it was worth it.All in all, how can you go wrong at this place?  I remember it being better, but that also might be because it was the first time that I was there (and really drunk and hungry.)  I still recommend it, but it was not the best that I had...",1,1,1,Frank W.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,4,0

2.0,5/30/2009,"I've been to a couple of Churrascarias in my lifetime; however I was truly disappointed after visiting Churrascaria Plataforma. The night started out awesome with a glass of Caipirinha (recommended), and pitchers of quenching sangria. However, it just went downhill from there.Even though the highlight of the restaurant is the meat, I found the salad bar to be a little lacking. If you want to be a top notch restaurant in the heart of New York; I expect everything offered to be spectacular - instead of cutting corners and presenting mediocre dishes. The sushi is terrible, the cheeses average, the salad just barely a tier above sizzlers. But hey, you're there for the meat right?The side dishes served are basically little snacks you pick at while waiting glutinously for the next meat carver. Just a little note, the pork tenderloins for some reason are always dry. The prime rib was probably the best slice of the night; juicy and full of flavor - maybe I should have asked for a side of au jus and creamy horseradish. The pichana, the chicken, the sausage, the flank steak (extra dry), the octopus, the ribs, and every other kind of meat that they provided all just seemed pretty average. On a negative note, there was a server carrying around grilled pieces of cheese; I went on to ask him what kind of cheese it was. His response was ""uhh.. I don't know.. white?"" You would expect someone serving the dish to know what he was serving, but I guess not.Next come the $9 desserts. You would expect a $56 dinner to include a little dessert, but nope - I forgot I lived in New York. The tiramisu was a bit soggy and the creme brulee was not anything I haven't had before. However, my friend said the neapolitan cake was not bad.Our bill came out to $500 exactly for 4 people after tax and tip. Granted we had a handful of pitchers of Sangria; I didn't feel the meal was worth it at all. Unless you're a 500 pound glutton that can devour pounds and pounds of meat - you're definitely better off finding a nice steak house (which shouldn't be hard in NY) and enjoy the quality of meat rather than the quantity.",1,0,0,Howard C.,"New York, NY",11,25,16
4.0,5/28/2009,"I really liked this place.  Note that it's family friendly and not very romantic.  It's a Brazilian spot.  It's different because when you sit down, they give you these coasters, each side being a different color.  When the coaster is displayed on one side, it means that you are serving yourself from the salad bar.  When the other side/color is displayed, it means that you want to be served meat.  So the waiters are walking around with these huge metal skewers and they slice the meat from the skewers and serve you.  They have chicken, sausage, and various cuts of steak from filet mignon to prime rib to flank.  The meat is cooked to perfection - I personally like it rare - very tender and tasty.  I definitely enjoyed the meal, and have to agree with the other reviewers that the meat is definitely the highlight of the place.  I would definitely go here again, just to sample the many different cuts of steak and simultaneously pick at the salad bar, which has some basic sushi, california rolls and an assortment of seafood salads.  It's a cool place to take someone who's never been.  I don't think this is a good place for newer dates.  Something wholly unattractive about big meat skewers and shoving hunks of rare meat into your mouth.",2,1,2,M.

When you are first seated, the waiter will bring you a list of side dishes you can choose from. The only somewhat decent side dish was the fries.

He even played a joke on one of our guests on our table. We have no idea what said manager's name is, but we'll go by Dino (a joke a coworker and I thought of) from hence on. After seating, Dino told us the rules. Rules? Yes, I said rules. Simplicity was the theme here tonight. You are given a coaster, but don't put your cup over it. It is rimmed with red or green on either side. Simple as a stop sign. Red means stop (no more meat service) and green means go (bring on the meats!). He also told us to go easy on the salad bar and heavy on the meat. Say what Dino?!But can you blame the man for trying to warn us? I couldn't help it! My eyes feasted on the massive salad bar options! Sushi, soup, lentil salads, and galore! My mistake that night? Trying to go heavy on BOTH the salad and meat.  After my weak attempt to finish my salad plate, I proceeded to the meat service. The wait staff comes to you with skewered meat and carve the meat for you. Thank goodness for the given tongs! I'm an accident waiting to happen. I was kind of disappointed because I greedily inhaled my salads. It's okay though, I still got to enjoy most of the meat. Dessert came along and I got the creme brulee. It was delish!!!

They were referred to this place by some very wealthy clientel and based on their first successful trip, were eager to introduce us to the experience. We arrived on time for our 8pm reservation. We were told over and over 5 mins more to wait, but 5 quickly became 25 and it was nearly 9pm by the time we were seated and the whole group was pretty annoyed.Our table host was fantastic and let us know the drill. We started off with drinks. I had the traditional Caiprihana and my girlfriend had a passion fruit version. I liked hers better. Others ordered bloody mary's, which i didn't hear any complaints about.Our host also warned us to not fill up too much on the salad bar, which was really easy to do. There were hot and cold selections ranging from pasta bows and tortellini to octopus salad, to shrimp and sushi to scalloped potatoes (which were especially creamy and delicious). Then it was meating time. Not being a red meat eater I wondered what options I'd have, but there was so much to choose from. BBQ pork ribs were very tasty and the meat fell off the bone. Pork sausages were also great. Had me a few of those. BBQ Chicken was moist and full of flavour, but my fave was the bacon wrapped turkey. The host had to track the sever down for a me few times. He seemed to circulate less than the red meat folks, but I didn't really mind. Helped give me a bit of digestion time, so I could stand to eat another piece. My GF had the coconut caramel cake, which was sub-par. My husband had the chocolate mousse and his friend had the tira misou. Neither of them complained. As for me, I couldn't eat another bite, so the dessert, great or not, was a complete non-issue (as I'm sure it is for most folks).Overall we enjoyed ourselves, but not sure how soon we will return.

We chose to stay anyway.We had beepers for the wait. Never a good sign.But apparently even people with reservations were complaining about the wait...45 minutes at least so I didn't feel so bad. Gave me time to have a caipihrina(sp) which at first sip was strong and kinda bitter but scrumptious by my third sip. All you need is two. Seriously.It was noisy.People and piano bossa nova music (that was cool and kinda sexy) and the distinct sounds of carnivours devouring flesh...not unlike what I imagine the serenguetti must be like.But I knew it was a full out flesh fest SO...You get the salad bar and lots of skewers of an assortment of meats coming around your  table continuously if your green disk is showing.Red disk/green disk is how they know when to stop at your table and they swarm in when it's green...really.The prime rib was excellent. The flank steak was kicking. The lamb was good too. The meats were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. The sides at the table were oily and /or overcooked so pass on those, not worth the tummy space.The salad bar had roasted veggies and sushi and seafood salads as well as different types of sides. My favorite part of the menu I think.The drinks,the dessert and the coffees etc. are all extra (where they truly get your wallet) but don't pass on the flan/tiramisu/or creme brulee.The service is fast.

5.0,2/17/2009,"awesome. i don't think i can eat or do something else that's part of the digestion process for the next couple days. basically any kind of meat you can think of, they have it. i tried about 15 different cuts of meat - prime rib, beef ribs, pork ribs, pork tenderloin, lamb, chicken, sausage - it was such a novelty to have the servers coming around with these huge slabs of meat, it was kind of like dim sum. except all meat and all-you-can-eat. also awesome are the cheesy bread balls they bring out at the very beginning. i know they're brazilian but the name escapes me. the sides were pretty good as well, and they included fried bananas, mashed potatoes, ""vegetable of the day"", rice, polenta... and i don't recommend skipping the salad bar, because 1) it's a pretty good spread, and 2) it's good to get other (lighter) foods and flavors in between the meats.",0,0,0,Jessica W.,"San Francisco, CA",576,326,27
4.0,2/11/2009,"I am going to give away my secret for successful dining at a Brazilian Rodizio Steakhouse, so pay attention:1. We actually have Plataforma Churrascaria in Brazil, so yes, it is authentic. 2. Skip the buffet, you will be a lot more successful with your meat eating without stuffing yourself with useless buffet items (though sushi is hard to avoid). 3. Order a caipirinha if you want a mixed drink, made of a sugar cane spirit- cachaca, lime, sugar and plenty of ice, its refreshing and goes well with meat. In Brazil we can order a caipirinha of virtually any kind of fruit so ask and see if they have other types.4. Order a BRAHMA beer if they have it (they usually do). Best beer in the world!5. Ask for PICANHA- best slice of meat they serve. It is very thinly sliced and is better when done medium-rare (trust me on this one!)6. Second best slice of meat is FILET MIGNON WITH CHEESE. Sizzling hot, with melted grated cheese. 7. Pao de Queijo is awesome, make sure they give you some at your table. Also ask for pastel (like an empanada), either stuffed with cheese or meat. 8. If they have coconut cake as a desert option, GO FOR IT! 9. The Tribeca location is okay, but this Hells Kitchen location is 10x better. I had my graduation lunch at this location, and we all had a really good time. We didn't feel rushed to eat and finish at all. I celebrated New Years 2008 at the Tribeca location and it was really fun, even the people working there were dancing and celebrating with us. Everyone who works at Plataforma is really nice, most of them are Brazilian and do speak Portuguese. It is a huge space, so is perfect for any kind of group celebration, outting or business lunch/dinner. People who work here are generally really acomodating with any kind of special request you may have, less salty meat, well done, more sides, so don't be shy. This is the perfect place to eat, drink and be merry-- and stuffed!",5,0,4,Nicole C.,"New York, NY",124,299,3
4.0,2/5/2009,"This is the Meal of the Gods. Unlimited, juicy meat, sliced right onto your plate as though you are royalty.

3.0,2/4/2009,"This churrascaria is wonderful, but extremely overpriced. For about $56 you get the usual suspects. My favorite was the sirloin and the suckling pig (accompanied by an extraordinary sauce). But for that much money, in my opinion, there shouldn't be an extra charge for house coffee or dessert (or at least have some sort of standard dessert offering at the cold bar). Also for that price I would expect that every piece of meat to be excellent, or at least pretty good, which they were not. Some cuts were dry, some were over seasoned, some were too greazy. I was there with friends for 2 hours but am not sure we saw everything there was to offer. I didn't see any rabbit, garlic bread, and I had to request the chicken hearts, although I couldn't eat them.. they tasted so gamey. I usually enjoy chicken hearts whenever I go to churrascaria, but these were weird. The salad bar has a small selection compared to what I am used to at other churrascarias, but the salad was good (I like my salad simple with greens, beets and balsamic).The ambience is very classy, but live music would have been nice for the price (they only have it on Fri & Sat around 7pm?).The service was great.For the price I will not return.

I took away another star for the fact that the salad bar was not nearly as glorious as what I had expected. Having been to Brazil, many of these places in Dallas, Porcao on Park Ave and Brazzas in Chicago I expected Platforma to have the premier salad bar. Sushi was fresh but the assortment was limited.

5.0,1/29/2009,"Oh my god... this place was AMAZING!!!!!!!! I am a huge meat lover and when it was announced that we would be trying this incredible Brazilian Churrascaria for my birthday I was super excited. This restaurant is beautiful, immaculate and the food is beyond delcious. Based on the reviews I had seen here on Yelp, I heeded the advise of the other Yelper's and avoided eating too much from the beautiful salad bar spread. The selections included 4 hot dishes and a number of cold salads, fish, sushi, etc... I personally loved a twist on the traditional scalloped potato that included ham. Also awesome was the pasta with pesto and turkey (random, but good). The green salad was crisp and tasty with a wide selection of toppings and dressings. My fiance really loved the rice and beans that they were featuring that night. Once we had a small sampling at the salad bar, we decided to flip our little discs over to green and unleash the meat. I was floored at how quickly you are bombarded with meats, as many as one can imagine, one right after another. The first offering was flank steak, which can be tough, but was tender and delicious (my favorite of the evening). There are many people who mentioned that they try and fill you up on the cheap meats first and then bring out the expensive stuff. Not the case when we were there... it honestly just seemed that whoever came out of the kitchen first is who came to your table. Our seccond offering was prime rib, which was delicious also... then came sirloin, ribs (pork and beef), chicken and sausage, bacon wrapped beef loin, bacon wraped turkey, grilled cheese (not the sandwhich, but actually cheese that is carmalized on the outside, really tasty). The meats just kept coming. It was a little overwhelming and after a few minutes I had to turn my disc back to red just to have a moment to process all the food infront of me. The side dish offerings were really delicious as well. You are given a list an can order none, or all... it is your choice. We decided to try as many items as we could, but skipped over things like fries and onion rings to try the more native foods. The fried plantains and the polenta were AMAZING, and the white rice was flavorful and cooked to perfection. My favorite was the broccoli, which was cooked just right, still green with just a bit of bite left in it, but tender, with this garlic oil over it. The one thing we found a bit odd was the Yuca Flour with Bacon. It was really dry, almost like toasted bread crumbs with bacon bits in it... I think it would have been more enjoyable on top of something, like a soup, than just on its own. I have seen some reviewers complain that they were rushed out the door. Not the case for us! Despite the fact that we were eating on a busy Saturday night, the wait staff was extremely attentive and not pushy at all. When we finally decided we could have no more and were ready to give up, they encouraged us to stay and rest and see if we could fit more food. One server said, ""we are open until 2:00, take a rest and see if you can eat more."" Seeing that our reservation was for 7:00PM, that definately isn't rushing you out the door in my book... I was consistently impressed with the service, they were fast, polite, professional and attentive. They have a really good system for getting everything to you in the midst of all the meat being paraded by. They also have a woman who comes around with traditional Brazilian drinks you can try, which we skipped to save money. We did try and dessert though and it was quite good. We had the coconut custart, which has a macaroon like base with a dense dome of coconut ""custard"" on top. It had a more thick and gritty consistency than most custards, but was very tasty. They also brought a piece of cheesecake to the table with a sparkler in honor of my birthday (they did this at every table it seemed, I guess everyone come here for a birthday). The cheesecake was average at best, and I thought it was a bit tacky that they charge you for the cheesecake when they just bring it without asking you if there is something else you would like... that is about my only complaint about the whole evening. We were exceptionally satisfied and can't wait to go back again... if it was less expensive this would be alot sooner!",2,0,3,Michelle M.,"Port Jefferson Station, NY",49,235,12

The buffet of non-meats was just as fantastic; that alone could have been a separate meal. I felt like a kid in a candy store. The only difference is that you really can eat tons of candy (who cares about the ensuing belly-ache) but you literally cannot shove the amount of meat they offer into your belly without excusing yourself and purging in the bathroom (I did not do that, just so you know, but I feel like I should have just so I could eat more meat).

Even with the 'red' facing up, I was asked if I wanted garlic bread (piping hot and delish!), octopus and grilled cheese squares. I definitely got full quickly - and sort of regret not going there while starving, but oh well. I also tried my first caipirinha - not my kind of drink, though. Too strong! The waiter saw me pass it to my friend, however, and insisted on making me a differently flavored one.

I'd give this place 3.5 stars overall.I was in a party of about 20 people. I made sure to eat basically nothing for lunch and to skip the salad bar. I did actually eat some of the sushi (not the rolls), before and after the meat, but that was it. It sure took a long time to get to the meat. I guess I had to wait for everyone to gorge themselves on the cheap stuff. Like another poster said, its probably a strategy to make people full. I was about to take that large steak knife and do my best Anthony Perkins in Psycho rendition.I came from a family who knows their beef so to speak. Some of the cuts of beef were fantastic and some were just blah. I personally like my beef, medium rare - rare. I hate to have to chew and chew and chew to swallow. If I recall the top sirloin was really great and the flank. The ribeye that everyone was touting was not so good. The bacon wrapped filet was okay as well. Some people love end cuts, but I detest them and I got them a few times and they are always so tough. It didn't seem all the waiters were really interested in getting you what you wanted--more just slice and give. I actually had to have a co-diner ask for a better cut for me and I took the slice and didn't eat the one I was given. Did not eat ribs or anything non-beef. It all looked dry anways. I chose the creme brulee for dessert. It was unevenly heated some parts warm some parts cold. Creme brulee should not come right out of a refrigerator. The Napoleon was good and the tiramisu was pretty average from the other desserts I tried.Service was average to very good depending on who it was. With such a bustling organization, variation is unfortunate, but not surprising.I think the bill for like 20 people was like $2300 or something and that was with dessert, wine, beer and San Pellegrino.Verdict: Don't overeat on the salad bar/buffet and save your stomach for your inner carnivore.

4.0,9/10/2008,"Tip #1 - Don't eat anything ALL day if you know that you will be coming here for dinner.  This place takes all you can eat to an entirely different level.  Seriously - if you have a friend that takes the term 'all you can eat buffet' as a personal challenge, this is the place to bring them to shut them up for good.  Churrascaria is not only a fun environment with their huge table settings for groups that usually has some sort of live music in the evening with a a separate bar area for scenesters - the meat is simply delectable (and literally endless).  When you arrive at the table you will find an empty plate where you can gorge yourself from a pretty major salad bar that has everything from salad to sushi and other chilled side dishes.  If you happen to have a vegetarian in your party - they can more than fill themselves here before the meat even arrives at the table.At the table - where your plate once stood - you will find a coaster looking circle that has one side that is green and another side that is red.  Once you turn the coaster to green side up - it's game on and the servers will come over to you with piping hot, flavor dripping meats to slice onto your plate.  the key here is to not fill up on the portions early on.  The meat is yummy and you will be tempted to fill up on the steak and ribs but don't be fooled - the best is yet to come.  As the evening moves on and you struggle to consume the steamy flesh on your plate  - the meat gets better and more exocitc.  Expect to see lamb shank, homemade sausages, chicken hearts, grilled octopus and much much more.If I were you - I would have a couple of glasses of red wine during the course of the meal to help digest the stomach full of meat that you will have coasting along the borders of your stomach.This place is great for a night out with the co-workers, an early start to a long night of binge drinking with friends or an adult birthday dinner with the family!",2,0,0,Raymonde G.,"New York, NY",85,11,2

4.0,8/24/2008,"This is not child's play, you need a strategy when you come to this place.  It is a veritable, formidable feast, but you must manage yourself!  Follow these guidelines if you want to get the most from your experience.1) Arrive hungry (duh)2) Avoid the salad bar.  This can be difficult if you complied with number 1, but you *must* avoid the salad bar and reserve that precious room for the meat that's on its way.  You'll regret wasting the space on that lettuce, I promise you.3) The cheese bread.  Indulge in one of them if you haven't tried them, or if you took #1 too seriously.  They're pretty good, but remember, you're here for the protein!4) When the meat starts coming around, pay attention.  You don't necessarily want everything that comes your way.  It's all good, but some cuts are better than others, and you want to focus on those, don't you?  In my experience it felt like the cuts got progressively better as the meal went on, so that by the time the filet mignon was going around, I wasn't really that hungry anymore.  Unless you really like sausage, chicken, or turkey, skip!  There will be lamb, short rib, and skirt steak.5) You need some sweetness to cut all that sodium+meat at the end, right?  I liked their tiramisú and my friend's cheesecake looked delish (though for me that would have been wayyy to heavy by then).  Their espresso is amazing, served with a small slice of lemon peel on the side.  I hadn't seen that set-up before.  Apparently you just dip it for a second to help cut the bitterness (don't leave it in too long though).Ok, now go feast, fellow carnivores!",0,0,0,Demitasse E.,"New York, NY",15,209,61

The Brazilian wannabe at the McCully Shopping Center isn't worth the visit once you've been in a place like Plataforma.  True, you'd need to travel to Manhattan, but if you're there, it's really worth the visit. Definitely a must for carnivores.  The succulent, protein rich meats and poultry are paraded to your table by extremely polite waiters. Service is constant--but we did arrive early before the place became packed, so maybe that was a fluke. The food is soooo good and soooo fresh off the grill and/or rotisserie that it's still steaming & sizzling when it gets placed upon your plate with dignified ceremony befitting any work of art that gets sliced to your pleasure.  For you vegetarians (poor things) the salad bar is extravagant & satisfying, but for those of us who would rather save the tummy space for the bloody stuff, vegies are just an afterthought.",2,2,2,Jo Ann V.,"Honolulu, HI",8,80,0

5.0,8/3/2008,"This is probably one of the most beautiful eating experience that I've had.I've never been here before until yesterday, but I've had Brazilian food at other places, so I was somewhat familiar with the servers carving meat at your table. My friend told me to go to the Tribeca loacation, and he did not disappoint. This is probably one of the most classiest restaurants I've seen, and the service is great. The meal is one set price, which does not include dessert or drinks. The drinks are reasonably priced. I tried a Brazilian beer, Brahma, which was darker than most light beers and had a nice pop to it. We then ordered a Caipirinha, which is kind of like a mojito. It's a little sweeter, and a kind of has a cinnamon flavor? Anyway it was good and reasonably priced $10. In the Tribeca location, there is a beautiful glass wine vault that enticed us to order wine.Our server told us there were 18 meats, so we started with the meats rather than the salad/cold bar. Pace yourself. If you have a partner, I would suggest sharing some of the bigger pieces like chicken or duck. I tried all of it, even the chicken hearts. Here were my favorites in order... 1) Prime rib, a tie... 2) Grilled Pork (they char the fat, so it's extra crispy), 2) Flank Steak, 3) Duck. They all serve lamb, turkey wrapped in bacon (wasn't the biggest fan of this), beef ribs, pork ribs, pork with mushroom sauce (the pork meat just fell apart). The tongs are for the meat, so when the server carves, you use your tongs to hold the meat until he finishes carving. Order a bottle of wine, it's reasonably priced, we got one for $35, which tasted like a $45-$50 wine. I can't remember the name (sorry). Also, if it's your birthday, have your party there. They light up a firecracker/sparkler for the cake, which is absolutely beautiful.I did check out the cold bar, and tried a bit of the sushi and ceviche like dishes, but I wasn't too impressed. The rice in the sushi did have the mirin/rice wine vinegar flavor, so the sushi was a bit dry. I ended up having to eat it sashimi style. There was a wheel of asiago or parmesean that impressed me at the buffet. Anyway, I would skip this if you have a small appetite. Your $55 includes: the 18 choices of meats, garlic bread grilled toasted, various appetizers at your table (garlic mashed potatoes, plantains, polenta, rice, steak sauce (salsa, yucca)), parmesan bread, cheese puffs (which they replenish), and the cold bar (various seafoods like shrimp cocktail and sushi, salads (brussel sprouts, collard greens), so go there with a big appetite.If you like design, check out their light bulb chandelier (Ingo Maurer?) and water installation next to the staircase. $55 for this experience is not that bad... ;)",1,0,0,A H.,"Manhattan, NY",61,208,426

5.0,7/1/2008,"4 1/2 stars. Let me get the negatives out of the way, the few side dishes that are offered here (carrots, broccoli, mashed potatoes, fried bananas) could have been expanded to a couple more options, are alright but really lack seasoning, came to us a little less hot than ideal, and were kind of mediocre attempt that could have been done better. The price was very high, it ended up being the most expensive meal I've had in the city. For two people with 2 drinks a piece and dessert and a 19% tip the bill was $200. Some may have the moola to eat like this all the time or every once and so often but I'm not Rockafeller. On a lighter note if you skip any alcohol, go out for dessert after a nice walk afterwards and go for lunch instead of dinner you can probably expect a much more affordable (yet still expensive) bill of $100 or so. Given the price and ambiance I dressed up a bit and was incredibly surprised at the casual attire of most people here, there were groups of college kids in their early 20s, tons of kids under 12, and people in t shirts and sandals here. The place is high class and fancy but the people were surprisingly not (not to mention this was the Saturday night crowd). Guess a lot of Manhattanites who have money come here like average joes would go to a cheap Chinese buffet. [Word to the wise, there's a man who comes around when you're done with a non-alcoholic sparking wine that he recommends to complete your meal and aid digestion and/or to pair beautifully with your dessert. The drink is delicious but he pours about the amount of 2 shot glasses in a small glass and as it turns out, is $9 which I thought was a bit much.]You may wonder with all the criticisms why I gave it 5 stars?...It's because this place ROCKS! The never ending parade of pleasant waiters in tuxes carrying skewers of various meats to your table, cutting the meat specifically for you is amazing. The number of choices seem endless, and if you've got enough on your plate (or belly) you have a disc on your table that you flip to red alerting the waiters to pass over your table like saint nick to a bad little boys house. The waiters not carrying the meat (like the guy who fills your water) are incredibly attentive and kind. The meat is very well seasoned and prepared, the prime rib and top sirloin are the best. Go very hungry because you'll want to try everything, twice. On top of that the place is beautiful and they had live music there at the perfect volume for background noise so you can still talk to your company.

5.0,6/28/2008,"meat, meat and more meat. The coasters are the equivalent of red light/green light.  It's delightful.  The problem is that there's also a buffet for salads and some other small items that you are given access to before the meat starts rolling through.  Word of advice, don't fill up on that.  Also, try to restrain yourself from the tasty little cheese bread puffs that are served.  I made the mistake of eating a bunch of those before I got to have the main meal.There's about 15 types of meats circling at all times so you probably don't want to bring your vegetarian/pescatarian/vegan friends here.  In the beginning I got too over anxious and wanted to try every single possible thing, but that quickly became a bad idea, so I only showed off the green coaster for the truly impressive cuts of meat.  The long bone rib was the one that sealed the deal.  It looked like something straight out of the Flintstones.It's the kind of place that makes me wish I could eat more.  As it was I was stuffed to the gills after coming here.Did I mention the caprihanas?  They are made table side and they have a traditional one as well as a couple of fresh fruit varieties.  I had the passion fruit one.  Yum!  I loved it, even though I felt like a total glutton...which I guess isn't all bad! :)  I am usually a buffet hater, but this was not your traditional buffet fare.  I would definitely return, but I'd need to fast for a few days before I go so I can get my money's worth!",2,0,0,Lu E.,"South San Francisco, CA",186,248,39

The ambience is wonderful; it is a well-done, richly colored (think dark and wood) large room which complements what you are going to eat (meat, and lots of it.) When seated, they take your drink order (caipirinhas...mmm yummy) and send you to the salad bar. It is tempting to stock up--but resist the urge. All the stuff on the salad bar--including the sushi--was high-quality and tasty. But the main star of the evening is the beef, and room has to be left for that. Most cuts of the beef were good to excellent--I particularly love the filet. While they do the beef well, I did not really enjoy the chicken or other cuts of meat as much. Service is exceptional when I went (on both occasions) and the servers are very quick and efficient. Would give this 3.5 start because the meat cuts that they do well (mostly all the beef) are exceptional, but the other meat cuts are rather lackluster and filler.

I was shocked that they didn't serve fried plaintains or yucca (a traditional Churrascaria dish) but rather offered a breaded banana and french fries.  The salad bar had several odd choices including Sushi and a few unappetizing soups. The breads were uninspired and flavorless.Like other reviewers I'm going to say that the beef was excellent, however, the chicken and sausage were bland and tasteless and the suckling pig was nearly inedible. Dessert and Coffee were not included in the Prix Fix and at nearly $140 for the pleasure of walking in the door, I wasn't all that inspired to try it.  It's a shame, the atmosphere is quite pleasant and I think that a fully inclusive prix fix would help take the sting out of the overall price of the meal.Overall, this was a mediocre experience.  I didn't go to stuff myself silly and I honestly was hoping for something a little more authentic.  I'm surprised that this comes as such a highly recommended place.  For the price, there are far better eateries in the city.",1,0,0,Brandon M.,"Natick, MA",115,32,0
4.0,2/25/2008,"How to eat at a Churrascaria.**  PREPARATION **Given the investment of time, money and energy, be thoughtful in your approach to this meal.- If possible try to schedule a lunch or early dinner event (yes folks, if you've never tried this it is an event) because it will take a few hours and you will need time to digest before you can do anything else.  As others have mentioned, try get a few people (at least 4) to go.- Do not starve yourself in the days before the meal because your stomach will shrink and you do not want this when you sit down to eat.  Instead eat well and drink lots of water.- Have a light breakfast if you're doing lunch.  Have a very light lunch if you're doing dinner.  - Mentally, you want to focus on arriving hungry, but being able to pace yourself for maximum meat intake.******  THE MEAL ******The meal consists of three stages: salad bar, meat and dessert.  During the first two stages pacing is key.  Remember to leave room for Papaya cream (more on this later).- Salad bar: I have many friends who skip this alltogether and go straight for the meat.  I like to check it out and start with some of the veggies, usually tomotoes and grilled asparagus, if it's available.  Never fill up on this.  I always skip the sushi.[Bread sidenote:  the cheesebreads and other dishes they bring to the table are tasty, but keep in mind that it's about the meat.  Try to avoid eating more than one or two cheesebreads.]- Meat course:  Friends, everything builds up to this.  Choose carefully and make sure that you are in control of your plate at all times.  Don't let the meat pile up because you'll take a while to eat it.  Once the meat cools, it's not as tasty.  If you feel you are overwhelmed by waiters bringing meat, turn your coaster to red and take a time out.  When you are ready to continue, you can turn the coaster back to green.I stay away from chicken and sausages to focus on the different cuts of beef and the lamb.  Sometimes I'll have some fish, but this is rare.  Remember to take your time, savor the meat and enjoy your company as well.  Once you are full, it's time for dessert.- Dessert:  Leave the tiniest bit of room for the Papaya Cream.  I have never been a fan of fresh papaya, but this cream--topped with Creme de Cassis--is refreshing and wonderful.  Do not skip.A note on beverages: A Caipirinha is a traditional Brazilian drink with cachaca, sugar and limes.  It's tasty and potent.  If you want to increase your chances of a successful meal, start with one and then switch to wine or beer (I like beer).I love Brazilian BBQ and would give this place 5 stars, but I haven't been here in a while so I need to reassess.  That said, this place is great (as are the other ones in the city).  Go eat some meat already!P.S.  If you're vegetarian, don't bother.  You will not get the same happiness from the all-you-can-eat salad bar that the meat eaters will get from the meat.  I know because I've been here with a vegetarian before.",4,1,4,Diane A.,"Manhattan, NY",30,145,0

5.0,9/5/2007,"If you have ever dreamed of eating like the King of Brazil, I recommend you put that crown on your heavy head, call a few friends and head to Platforma. I had walked by this place in Hell's Kitchen several times before, salivating at the idea of the plentiful skewers of meat, and imagined myself inside, on the other side of the glass, dining, and thinking ""who is that guy that looks like me salivating and fogging up the glass outside?""I was awoken from one of these reveries by a call from my parents, who were planning on coming to see a broadway show in a week, and asked for a suggestion of a place to eat. Immediately, I suggested this place, and invited myself to join. We went for a late lunch, and probably could have gone without the reservation, since the place was not terribly busy for lunch. After we sat down, we were directed to the salad bar, where I enjoyed delicacies like Marinated Garlic, cheeses, veggies, hearts of palm salad, and this bean salad they are supposed to be known for (though I thought it was pretty much like any other bean salad). Once we had started to finish our salads, a collection of plates of treats like Brazilian steak sauce, yucca flour, fried banana and tiny bread was laid out before us. We were each given a coaster: green on one side, red on the other. As soon as the coasters turned to green, the men with skewers approached us, offering us tender, juicy meat including prime rib, turkey, pork sausage, pork loin, rib eye steak, beef ribs, pork ribs, leg of lamb, lamb chops, even salmon. In fact, it is hard to keep up with it all, though meat lovers will have a harder time turning anything down. Some in our party like the rib eye best, others the leg of lamb, but for me, it was some of the best prime rib I have ever had, rare, tender, and almost sweet. A couple of notes: if you go for dinner, the salad bar includes an assortment of sushi and other seafood that is not offered for lunch. Also, while I did not have any drinks myself, I have heard that they add up very quickly here, This is a great place to bring family, business associates and friends, though I am not sure I would recommend it for a first date--unless your potential mate's idea of attractive includes someone dripping with meat juices and ready to burst.

Tip: don't eat too much in the beginning.

Utter HEAVEN!  If by definition vegetarian means ""rabid carnivore""!!There's a bar full of various cold foods, your typical salad / appetizer type fare, but what everyone should come here prepared for is the beautiful meat.  If you don't think you can handle eating too much, make sure you get your money's worth and just skip the cold bar and go all out on meat!As a Brazilian steakhouse the assortment of meat is served to you by a waiter ready to slice a piece off for you.  All the meat tastes incredibly fresh and flavorful as if they gored the animal directly onto the metal spindles and slapped it on a rotisserie right there in the foyer prior to heading to your table.Here's a tip, if you're sitting at your table wondering ""why is no one coming by with the meat?"" That cool red circular coaster your drink is sitting on? That's actually a stop/go sign. Flip it over to green for them to serve you meat, red to stop.Another tip?

3.0,6/30/2007,"I had wanted to eat here for years. Having grown up in the New York area, I return frequently and I'm a fan of churrasco.What a huge disappointment. I researched this restaurant extensively before making reservations for myself and three of my friends. It was quite easy to get the time that we wanted and I was eager to finally make the trip.We were seated quickly although right by the entry to the kitchen. That wasn't much of a problem though it's certainly not my favorite place to sit.The first sign of the brusque, indifferent service, came early. Though my friends went to the large salad bar, I chose to start right in on the meat which (based on the reviews) promised to be stellar. I turned my little card to green and the servers practically descended like flies. (Okay, maybe that's the wrong analogy, but they just kept coming.) But, just about as quickly as the servers came, a busboy descended and grabbed my salad fork and knife. He only took mine -- not my friends' -- as if to say no salad for you. I thought that was pretty rude; he didn't ask, either.Now, to the meat. The sausage was pretty good. Prime rib was fatty but tender (because it was so fatty). Sirloin a bit tough. Pork loin was dry. Chicken nothing special. I'd say, overall, that the meat was fine but none of the four of us were impressed.Four different sides were placed on the table and none were stand outs. Some potato thing; a small plate of broccoli; greasy onion rings; and that bready stuff that Brazilians put on feijoada and meats. (It has a name; I just don't know what it is.)Service overall was too rapid. The restaurant was quite noisy (but that's just the way it is), and we definitely felt rushed by the servers. As soon as we stopped eating meat barely a minute passed before the plates were cleared and we were asked by the waiter? (who we hadn't seen for an hour) whether we were done with the meat and if we'd like any dessert. We said no to dessert but of course the dessert bearing woman came by anyway. We opted out on dessert, the table was cleared completely, and we asked for the check. Funny thing is the restaurant wasn't too busy at that point so they didn't need the table, but they followed whatever routine they're used to following and shuffled us out. We were pleased to leave.I could go on but I'll end this here. A big disappointment.If you like great churrasco, try Bairrada in Mineola, NY. Maybe half the price and twice as good.",0,0,0,WILLIAM P.,"Burlingame, CA",8,17,0

4.0,5/24/2007,"Churrascaria Plataforma, Portuguese for Triple Bypass, has recently become a popular choice of birthday celebration amongst my peers. Yes, it just doesn't get any manlier celebrating another year as a tough guy than a night of carnivorous and alcoholic binge. Well, maybe it can get a bit more manlier if you add in shotguns, monster trucks, and hookers in between. But I digress...The trick to having a good meal at this place is to be selective on what to eat. Pick only the cuts that you really enjoy. Do not be shy on declining offers from the gregarious skewer welding hombres. Just because you are green, it doesn't mean you are obligated to take a bite out of everything. Much like poker, eating at a Brazilian steakhouse is a game of patience and well timed aggression. Yes, I understand that it is inherently impossible for any man to decline a slab of meat when offered, but sacrifices must be made for the greater good. Stay focused, you are on a mission. As a general rule of thumb, I usually work on a generous portion of a cut and take anything wrapped in bacon on the side. Oh yes, and the BBQ ribs as well. Hopefully in the near future, Churrascaria will just cut all the BS and start serving bacon wrapped in bacon... deep fried. But until that day, I can only dream. Repeat until you have rotated all of the cuts that you desire. Under no circumstances should you turn red. Rumor speaks of an elusive beast which hides under the table and feeds on the manhood of the first man to turn red. No one likes a girly-man. Heed.Overall, Churrascaria is worthy of its upscale price tag. Dinner with drinks comes to around $100 with gratuity included. The reason Churrascaria received only four stars instead of five is because I always hate myself the next day after dining there. Going to Churrascaria is sorta like having drunken sex with an ex... It seemed like a really good idea at the moment, but you know you will regret it the next morning.P.S. I kid, Churrascaria Plataforma is not Portuguese for triple bypass.

In fact, we bought glasses first to try it out, and then decided we wanted a bottle, so he changed the bill and just charged us for the bottle they poured from.This place is a bit expensive. It's about 50 dollars a person just for food, I definitely second Diana N.

Price is not cheap, as in most Rodizio style places, they are a bit up there at $51.95 a person during dinner.  However, the ambiance of live music (Thursdays and Fridays), spacious tables make this an ideal setting for groups and dates alike.

There's a huge salad bar filled with all kinds of goodies including sushi (Brazil actually has a relatively large Japanese population, called Nikkeijin)...but the best part is the giant skewers of meat the goodlooking Brazilian waiters cart around and offer you. All kinds of cuts of Beef, Pork, Lamb, etc...they walk around and slice it for you fresh the way you like it. The great thing is is that you've got this card with one side that is green and the other red - GREEN for GO and RED for STOP! Ingenious. So if you want to take a breather, flip it to the red side. Ready for more meat? Flip it to the green side! All in all I must have gained 10 pounds after that. Beware though: make sure to remember to eat your veggies! After eating at Churrascuria however I couldn't touch meat in that manner for about 6 months because I had so much of it in one night!=)",1,0,2,Celicia C.,"New York, NY",21,55,0

Sure the meats are delectable, but the damn side dishes and salads are top notch. You can't help yourself but you will fill up on that stuff. Even those damn potato puffs they put on the table is yummy. Realistically, if you want only meat then you should have gone to Morton's or Smith and Wollenski's.Drinks and Desserts are not included and will add a hefty sum to the bill. With tips,drinks, and dessert... looking at $80-110.00 person.One time I came here 3 times in a month for birthdays and what nots. Yes I gained 10 pounds. So much variety so good.When you stop pigging out  and listen... the music is great here.If you get the feeling of being rushed through dinner, you are. Cuz you have 1 and 1/2 hour to eat before they kick you out for the next seating. But for the newbies that come here... they will have filled up in the first 45 minutes.

It almost got to the point where I almost vomited, even though I was full, I just could not get enough.The most important advice I can give though, don't waste your time at the buffet. These are merely designed ruses to allow you body to have time to digest and fill your stomach up with something else besides the meat. The food at the buffet is good, they are constantly checking it to see if there's anything they need to refill, as well as inspecting each individual dish there with a thermometer.

First you take a trip to the salad bar... but for the meats, the action will begin upon returning to the table where you will find a coaster-sized disk at each seating, they will all be turned on the red side, giving you time to enjoy the first course.As the salad quickly vanishes, side orders will be brought to the Table, such as mashed potatoes, white rice, beans, fried polenta, fried plantains, Fresh cassava meal called ""farofa"", and an addictive cheese bread called ""pao de queijo"".The main course, the highlight of the meal, will start when you flip your coaster-sized ""chip"" from the red side to the green side, signaling the meat cutter that you're ready to be served. Add a ""Caipirinha"" (a concoction of fresh limes, sugar, ice and ""cachaa"" - Brazilian liquor made from raw sugar cane) which are made table side, and the fun really starts!Not sure where to take those out of town guests --- the music and atmosphere are great - but make a reservation!

This is not a case of cow, pig, chicken everywhere but not an animal to eat.  The white meat is pretty good but the red meat is what you should really concentrate on. Flank steak, sirloin, ribs...The salad bar is a standout in its own right but you are here for the meat!!! Remember that! The scene itself is quite amusing. Some people actually come dressed up (while about half are not) which contrasts nicely with the staff running around with giant skewers/forks filled with various animals. Actually, almost everything brought out from the kitchen is on a skewer, even the garlic bread and potatoes. Perhaps I am amused easily but I found it entertaining to see a guy running around with a giant fork filled with garlic bread. Seems like it should be in a Monty Python skit for some reason. Instead of a plate I think they should give you one of those skewers for the salad bar. Just stab what you want and head back to your table.Bring a couple of friends, everyone will enjoy themselves.

4.0,7/12/2006,"I'm a cavegirl. I admit it. I'm a sucker for red meat. And now I know where to head next time I get a yen for some of the ol' carne. This place is unbelievable. Both the concept and the delivery.  Picture this: You're hungry. You are seated at a table and given a card with green on one side and red on the other. If you turn it green side up, a fleet of waiters will swing by your table carrying long skewers of juicy, mouthwatering grilled meats. If you like the sound of what they have to offer, be it fillet mignon, pork loin, ribs, sausage, flank steak, roast beast, or one of the many other cuts too numerous to mention, simply nod, and they'll slice off whatever chunk is done to your liking, right then and there. Not turned on by what is currently skewered? Just wait a minute for the next option to make its way to your table. Full to bursting? Turn the card to red and the meat orgy promptly ends.Now, now, veggies, don't despair. Their ""salad bar"" is worth joining your meat-eating friends for. ""Buffet"" comes closer to the truth than ""salad bar,"" considering they have sushi, shrimp cocktail, couscous, pilafs, risotto, and a million other entree-esque options for those who don't go in for the meat. Oh, yeah, and they have salad, too.The dessert cart is almost superfluous, if you've done your job right and eaten every kind of meat imaginable. But on the off chance you have room left for sweets, the cheesecake is lovely. And don't forget to order one (or three) of their signature caipirinhas. Zowie! I highly recommend this spot for a special occasion with friends and/or family, as it's a little rough on the checkbook. The neverending meat parade lends itself well to large groups of people in a festive mood. I suppose one could do a romantic evening there, but it wouldn't be my top choice. Then again, there were lots of couples all around me, and the live latin music did seem to set a lusty mood.",3,1,4,Ames F.,"New York, NY",54,86,6

In front of you there is a chip, one side is red, the other is green-the waiters will bring you meat, and continue to bring you meat as long as your ""chip"" is green. They walk around the room with giant pieces of succulent, perfectly-cooked MEAT that's just oozing with flavor. And they're not just carrying it around on a platter, its on a giant sword...what could be cooler you ask? Ill tell you...the fact that they slice it with GIANT knives. Now I know what you're thinking...how could this be safe...giant sword + giant knife = a lost limb, well I assure you it is because they're probably trained in the art of meat swordery, and I still have all my appendages. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves meat, wants to eat meat, and can eat a lot of...meat.

Meat after meat after meat comes by you (as long as you're still green lighting, that is), and the waiters present the various cuts on long skewers. At least ten different cuts of steak, pork, chicken, sausage, etc. passed by, not to mention the salmon option they also offered. My table completely bypassed the (reportedly phenomenal) salad bar in favor of getting straight to the good stuff. It was a good thing we did because there was more meat than we could literally chew. What peeved us, though, was that we (by which I mean the people at my table) saved (some) room for dessert in the hopes that they would continue this completely gluttonous feast and offer us multiple desserts. Sadly, disappointingly, frustratingly enough, they did not. No, they did not. ""Only one dessert per person.""
